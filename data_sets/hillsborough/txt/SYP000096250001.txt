RE: PREPARATIONS OF STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for copying to me the letter from Lord Justice Stuart Smith to Peter Metcalfe of
Hammond Suddards Solicitors relating to the above.

I believe that my letter of 5 November 1997 with its attached schedule and documents, read in
conjunction with the schedule and documents I provided to you on the 24 September 1997
covers the majority of the points you raise at paragraphs 2,3 and 4 in the above letter.

There are just two further points I would wish to add, one for clarification regarding the actual
amending of statements referred to in paragraph 3 of the letter and the second in relation to
Police Officers refusing to sign amended statements referred to in paragraph 4.

Amendments to statements/recollection were not carried out by Peter Metcalfe nor anyone
working at Hammond Suddards, copies of Officers self prepared recollections were forwarded to
Peter Metcalfe and his comments were returned by fax. Amended recollections were prepared by
a small South Yorkshire Police team, headed by Detective Chief Inspector Alan Foster and
Detective Inspector Phillip Jones. (Both officers are now Superintendents and are still serving).
These recollections were not in Criminal Justice Act form. They were then taken to their original
author and agreed with them before they signed them. They were passed to West Midlands
Police in this format.

South Yorkshire Police entered the officers recollections onto the HOLMES computer system as
reports and the computer gave them R            reference numbers. The West Midlands Police
entered these same recollections onto their HOLMES computer system as statements and the
computer gave them S         reference numbers. Thereafter when West Midlands Police printed
them out they automatically appeared as if they were a statement on CJA forms.

           Tel: 0114 220 2020 Fax: 0114 252 3855   Superintendent Hepworth
           Direct Dial No:
                                                   Tel (0114) 296 3084    Fax (0114) 2963113
Whilst searching the files to try and identify whether any officers had refused to sign their
amended recollections I came across a note which indicated that a small minority of officers had
initially objected to their recollections being forwarded to West Midlands Police. Five such officers
were named in the files and they were:

PC 2076 Cerrone               19 05 1989
PC 1285 Smith                 05 06 1989
PC 446 Groome                 06 06 1989
PC 1842 Brookes               15 061989
PC 1834 Scholey               05 06 1989

However the officers all withdrew their objections and the date alongside their name indicates
when their recollections were forwarded to West Midlands Police. I would however ask you to
note that officers were informed that their reports would not be released unless the officer
concerned gave their consent. (Memo DD2 of Chief Superintendent Denton dated 12 05 1989 -
forwarded to you with my letter of 5 November 1997 refers.)

Moving now to paragraph 4 of your letter it is quite clear that some officers expressed concern
about alterations and editing of their original recollection prior to submission to West Midlands
Police. This resulted in a letter being sent to Hammond Suddards and the circulation of a note to
all commanders in South Yorkshire Police on 23 May 1989 explaining why editing was taking
place and requesting that the note be brought to the attention of all officers. ( A copy of this letter
and note were provided to you on 24 September 1997 reference D62).

I am unable to trace from our files details of any officer who actually refused to sign their
amended recollections. It is not surprising though that in an organisation as large as South
Yorkshire Police, where individual officers gather and present their own evidence in statement
form and subsequently at court, that some individuals would express concern or even challenge
the right of a third party to amend their recollections.

If I can be of any further assistance in this matter please contact me.

          PREPARATION OF STATEMENTS FOLLOWING THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

         Thank y o u for your letter o f 28 O ctober 199 7 which as you k n o w did not in fact reach m e until /
         N o v e m b e r 1997.

         T h e fo llo w in g resp o n se is m ade with m y clients' permission but the factual material is derived from
         m y files a n d any v i e w s expressed are m y ow n . T he clien ts’ perm ission extends to d isclosing to you
          the attached d o c u m e n ts but this disclosure is in c o n fid e n c e to the H illsborough Scrutiny.


          H e r e are my an sw ers to the points raised under paragraph 4 o f y o u r letter,                                                                        I have g ro u p ed under
          item 1 c o m m e n t on each o f the points m ade in paragraph 3.


          1.1.             I understand that the decision to ask all officers present to prov ide s e lf taken statem ents w a s
                           m a d e at a m e e tin g at P o lic e Headquarters on M o n d a y 17 April 1989.                                                            I w a s n o t present at
                           this m eeting.                I cannot therefore say w hether officers w e r e specifically asked to include
                           c o m m e n t and impression

           1.2.            It is correct that w h e n the W e st M idlands P o lic e asked for statem ents from particular officers
                           the s e lf taken statem ents for th o s e officers w e r e forwarded to me.                                                                   I read through the
                           statem ents and m ade c o m m e n ts by fax to C h ief Superintendent D en ton , I did not amend any
                           statem ents.               W here my c o m m en ts su g gested changes, th ese w e r e principally removal o f
                           com m ent            and         impression.                   T hey          also         included          s u g g e stio n s      to     re-address                apparent
                           contradictions or ambiguities, to consider removal o f e v id e n c e about e v e n ts after the officers
                           had g o n e o f f duty and, on o cca sio n s, to reconsider intemperate language.


           1.3.            The statements were intended to be used for the purpose o f Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry
                           but they were not, so far as I am aware, intended to form Criminal Justice A ct statements.

                 offic e r s prov id in g ‘recollections in w r itin g ’ and ‘written su b m is s io n s ’.    1 w o u ld      have
                 e x p e c t e d this letter to refer explicitly to CJA statem ents i f that w a s the intention.

          9      W ith the p a ssa g e o f tim e it is difficult t o say precisely w h y this approach w a s adopted.           R e­
                 reading the file I think that it fo llo w e d on from the procedure ad o p ted with the senior
                 o fficers and In particular the officers w h o had borne the brunt o f the press criticism fo llo w in g
                 th e disaster. A t an early stage these officers w e r e asked by the W e st M id la n d s P olice to
4-               p r o v id e s e l f taken statements. I attach a co p y o f m y attendance n o te o f d isc u ss io n s on 2 9 /3 0
                 April 1 9 8 9 at w hich the provision o f these statem ents w a s disc u sse d b e tw e e n m y s e lf and
                 P e te r H a y es , the then D e p u ty C h ief Constable. T his states - at the to p o f p a g e 2:-


                              "It was agreed, however, that it w ou ld be sensible f o r me to see these
                             statem ents before they went Lo the West M idlands Enquiry> a n d to have
                             some time to go through them with the men involved".

                 A gain I c a n n ot really say whether this w a s m y idea or Peter H a y e s ’ idea hut it d o e s seem,
                 n o w as then, entirely appropriate. A ltho ugh there w a s no su g g e stio n o f criminal p roceedings
                 at that tim e, th e se men had been the subject o f sev e r e criticism and might w e ll expect to be
*                further criticised at th e enquiry.          I attach a co p y o f m y attendance n o te dated 2 M a y which
                  details the m eetin g with the senior officers on that day. T h e no te indicates that changes w ere
                  s u g g e s t e d but the co m m ent in relation to A C C Jackson d o e s tend to indicate that these
                  c h a n g e s w e r e not major.


                 W h e n the letter o f 7 M ay, referred to in 1.3. above, w as received by the South Yorkshire
     *
                  P o lic e , C h ie f Superintendent D enton sp o k e to m e on 9 M a y and a c o p y o f my attendance
                  n o te o f that conversation is enclosed.          Y o u will note the final paragraph w hich effectively
                  records the decisio n to scrutinise these statem ents w ithout stating w hether this w a s m y idea
                  or C h ie f Superintendent D e n t o n ’s. It d o es h o w e v e r record that the intention w a s to rem ove
                  "comm ent or m atters o f speculation

          3.      A s indicated at item 1.1. a b o ve I am not aw are that anyone specifically a sk e d for o fficers’
                  c o m m e n t s and impressions.         The only record o f the request will be in C h ie f Inspector
                  B e t t i s o n ’s n o te o f the m eeting o f 17 April w hich I have not seen.   There is no doubt that the
                  s e l f taken statem ents did include c o m m ent and impression.


                  W ith o u t w ish in g in any w a y to be flippant about such an awful tragedy I am afraid that the
                  reference to “usualprocedure" w o L.ld not have found an e c h o in the m ee tin g s w h ich w e had
                  at that time. N in e ty five p eo p le had died. Officers w h o had given a lifetime o f public service
                  suddenly found them selves objects o f public vilification and a ccu sed o f n e g lig e n c e leading to
                  m ass slaughter.       I do not think that anybody really kn ew what w o u ld be usual procedure in
                  t h o s e circum stances. I w o u ld say h o w e v e r that by then the enquiry into the ev e n ts - whether
                  it w a s eventually to turn into a criminal enquiry or not ~ w a s firmly in the hands o f the West
                  M id la n d s P o lic e w h o       had the authority to   im p o s e w h a tever procedure th ey thought
                  appropriate.

                   RE;        HILLSBOROUGH




                   (1)     A ttending Terry Wain on telephone 29/4.

                            He read to me the contents of a letter received
                            from the West Midlands Force, asking for Senior
•<                          Officers to prepare what would effectively be
                            self-taken statements to present to the West
                            Midlands inquiry.   This had given rise to some,
                            concern.   He and Belinda had drartso a torrn ot
                            holding response to be sent: by the Deputy, our
                            the latter had amended this to tone it down
                            somewhat.   I approved it in its amended form,
                            w hich effectively said that the Police would be
                          ' doing everything they could to co-operate but
                          ...asked what was the Specific purpose of. these.,
                            statements and whether they would be the only
                            statements likely to be required.

                            He told me that the Deputy would be seeing the
                            Officers concerned on Sunday and would like to
                            speak to me afterwards.  1 said that I would be
                            available.


                    (2)      I spoke to Peter Hayes at Sunday lonchtime.      The
                            Officers had now all seen the videos and were
                            fairly relaxed about giving factual, statements.
                            They were not particularly concerned that these
                            w o u l d be self-taken rather than CJA.  I raised
                            w ith him the points which had concerned me,
                            namely, that the inquiry was supposed to be
                            fulfilling some statutory functions in terms of
                            disciplinary proceedings and m terms of
                            supporting H.M. Coroner.      I said that it might
                            not be fair on the Officers if these se] f-t-aken
                            statements were to be used for those purposes,
                            as opposed to the purposes of the inquiry.      He
                            discussed this with the Chief Constacle, wno was
                            also present and said that the Chief Constable
                            was satisfied that the West Midlands inquiry nao
                            a duty to report only to the Judge.      Moreover,
                                                                              rt




                            it seemed that there was no practical ditticui
                            because there was not going to be anything in
                                                                              rt




                            self-taken statements which would not have been
                            in CJA statements if taken.


                                                                           contd.

                           It was agreed, however, that it would be sensibl
                           for me to sea these statements before they wer.t
                           out to the West Midlands inquiry and to have som
                           time to go through them with the men involved.
                           I said that 1 would make myself available on the
                           Bank holiday, if need be, but otherwise could be-
                           in Sheffield on Tuesday.  He said that he would
                           be considering the position and would contact ms
                           again later in the day.


                    (3)    Later on, he telephoned back and said that the
                           sensible course would be for me to come down to
                           Sheffield on Tuesday to discuss progress with
                           Stuart Anderson and then to see the Officers in
                           the afternoon.


•)                         I said that it might also be helpful at that,
                           stage to have a meeting with Terry Wain to
                           discuss format and presentation of the report
                           with reference to indexing and perhaps cutting
                           d own the appendix.

                           I also asked   if I could take away with me a copy
                           of the video  or videos which were relevant, to th
                           case and indeed any relevant still photographs.
                           He said that  he would arrange for this.

                           He said that  he would be going away for a     few
                           days break, but could be contacted if need be.

 A T T E N D A N C E NOTE


 DATE:      2nd May, 1989


 RE;        HILLSBOROUGH




 A tt e nd in g at Sheffield Police Headquarters.

 (1)     I had a meeting with the Chief Constable at which
         he asked how things were going and. I reviewed
         progress.

         He raised the point that Mr. Hayes appeared to
         have left instructions for the self-taken
         statements to deal only with the events of tne
         match;  he felt that they should go rather wider
         and deal with the planning and history.     I said
         that this depended very much on what had actually
         been asked f o r r but if the request for statements
        .was general, then the statements themselves, .should
         be general.

         He indicated that he would make himself available
         for consultations or meetings at any time in
         co nnection with this matter.


 (2)     I then spoke with Stuart Anderson and we discusser!
         what needed doing in the afternoon.    Essentially,
         this was to go through the self-taken statements
         w hi ch had been prepared and I asked then to have a
         disc us sion with Terry Wain about the format of the
         report.    At this stage, I was able to have a look
         at the letter which had been received from the Wes
         M idlands Force and I noted that it was somewhat
         ambiguous.    The request was for a recollection of
         events prior to, during and after the match.    My
         reading of this would have limited it to the day
         in question but, on the whole, I felt it
         preferable to deal with the case as fully as
         possible.


 (3)     During the course of the afternoon, I went through
         statements with A.C.C. Jackson (Operations),
         S up erintendent Roger G reenwood {Ground Commander),
         Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield (Overall
         Commander), Superintendent Roger Marshall
         (Liverpool Sector Commander), Superintendent
         Be rnard Murray (Operations, Second in Command),
       12-1 1   '97   10:45   FAX 0113   284 7001     HAMMOND SUDDARDS                      ©008




                              Su perintendent David Chapman (Nottingham Forest
                              Sector Commander) and Chief Inspector Bob Creaser
                              who was effectively a Sectoi" Commander under
                              Superintendent Marshall.

                              I made various suggestions for alterations to
                              their statements, the principal change being that
                              in respect of A.C.C. Jackson, who had not included
                              any of the details of the planning of the match.
                              It was agreed that he w ould be dealing with this
                              overnight and that I would attend at Sheffield
                              again on Wednesday to go through this.


                       (4)    I looked through the statement of Inspector Hans
                              Davis, in charge of mounted Officers.  Although
                              there were one or two minor changes which I would
•j                            have suggested, he was away on leave and it was
                              felt appropriate that his statement should be
                              handed over.


                       (5)     I then had further discussions with Terry Wain
                               and with Stuart Anderson.          The team have assembled
                               two sets of photographs dealing, respectively,
                               with the situation on both sides of the Lepoings
                               Lane turnstiles and inside the Leppings Lane
                              'terracing.         The latter p hotographs were
                               p a rt i cu la rl y instructive because, in a time
                               sequence, they appeared to show various people
                               standing at or around the mouth of the tunnel
                               d uring the whole period from 2.45 o.m. to 3.05 p.m.,
                               which would cast serious doubt on the suggestions
                               that there was some sort of a surge through the
                               tunnel as the result of a gate or gates beino
                               opened.        I was not able to take away copies of
                              t hese photographs but I was supplied with a set
# ■>
                              of copies of Police videos.           Later that evening,
                               I watched video number 14 which, interalia, shows
                               the situation inside and o utside the Leppings Lar.e
                              turnstiles.          The film goes into what is referred
                              to as elapsed time mode during the critical
                              period, so that there are e ff ec ti ve ly a series of
                              single shots with a gap of one to five seconds
                              between them.          This is not particularly helpful
                              but, insofar as anything can be made out, there
                              again does not appear to be a surge towards the
                              ou ts id e entrance of the tunnel, which has been
                              implicated in the disaster.


                       (6)    I asKed various of the Officers about leave
                              commitments.   Superintendent Murray indicated
                              tnat he had leave booked from 11th to 26th June
                              and Superintendent Gre en wo od from 19th May to
                              2nd June.   I promised to bring these matters to
                              the attention of the Tre as ur y Solicitor, although

                   -)
                          I could give no promise that they might not be
                          called during indicated periods.

                   DATE:      9th May, 198 9


                   RE:        HILLSBOROUGH




                   A t t en di ng   (1)   K. S. Anderson on telephone.

                                    (2)   K. G, Holmes on telephone.

                                    (3)   Don Denton on telephone.


                   (1)     He telephoned in response to my fax and said that
                           they understood there may be a need for editing.
                           He was concerned as to whether he would actually
                           be called into the meeting this afternoon and I
                           said that he should proceed with his existing
                           arrangements and that we would fit in if- we-
                           needed to consult him.  He said that he would be
                           providing some sandwiches at 5.00 p.m.

                           So far as the report/proof is concerned, the
                           basic version is about 2" thick, but there are
                           a very large "'amount of appendices. I said that
                           this was not too bad and that if we could cut it
                           down to 1" thick, with just a few crucial
                           d ocuments included as appendices to the report
                           itself, then I would be really quite satisfied.

                         ■ He was a little concerned as to whether the work
                          would be done by ourselves or by the Police and
                          I said that- we would wait and see the size of the
                          task before going any f u r t h e r .


                   (2)     He telephoned to mention his concern about the
                           overall financial cost of the operation.  He was
                           referring to the MMI involvement on behalf of all

                       on the representation as regards Counsel, our
                       intention was that there should only be one
                       representative from Hammonds at any given time,
                       w hich might be myself, Beli nd a or Kate. I said
                       that, nevertheless, there would be no harm in
                       putting the position on record.

                       I m e nt ioned that we had a c o nf er en ce this
                       a ft e rn o on and also there was the conference on
                       Friday, which he knew about.        He said that he did
                       not require to attend either of these conferences.

                       We d is cu ss ed the question of C o u n s e l ’s fees. It
                       was a gr ee d that I would try and do some research,
                       by wav of telephoning up people who had been
                       concerned in the Cleveland inquiry, with a view
                       to d i s c o v e r i n g what Brief fees had been paid.  In
                       this particular instance, we both agreed that ho
                       ought to specifically approve the Brief fee before
                       it was agreed and that this, in turn, might, need
                       the approval of Steve W a l k e r .


                (3)     He told me that they had now received the formal
                        request from the West Midlands for self-taken
                        statements for some 120 Officers, of whom they
                        al re a dy had Minutes or accounts of events in
                      ■ re sp ec t of 100.

                       Obviously, no problem was presented in relation
                       to t ho se who had not provided an account of events,
                       because they could be asked to do one specifically
                       for the West Midlands request.    As for the others,
                       there would need to be some scrutiny of the
                       exi st in g documents. Many of them might be suitable
                       to be handed on without further ado, but those
                       w hi ch included comment or matters of speculation
                       w ou ld probably have to be redone.  I said that we
                       might be able"to deal w ith something of this this
                       afternoon, depending on the extent to which time
                       was taken up with other matters,

RE:    AUDIT TRIAL OF POLICE OFFICERS SELF TAKEN STATEMENTS,
       OR "OFFICERS RECOLLECTIONS"

Following on from my initial examination of the South Yorkshire Police Document Files from
which I prepared a schedule, a copy of which I gave to you when you visited Sheffield on
24 September 1997, I have now completed a further examination of non-indexed document files
within the Hillsborough archives.      In particular I have examined the personal files of
Chief Inspector Norman Bettison and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton and within these files
are a number of documents relating to the above.

I have produced a second schedule and copies of the appropriate parts of the documents
referred to which together with the first schedule show how in date order from 17 April 1989 to
8 June 1989:-

a)    The decision that officers should make records of their recollections was arrived at. (NB1)

b)    Solicitors acting for South Yorkshire Police were consulted. (D2)

c)    The officer leading the investigation for West Midlands Police was aware. (D10)

d)    How South Yorkshire Police officers were made aware of what should be included in their
      statements. (D18)

e)    The discussion with Counsel which shows he was aware of "Self-service" statements. (D28
       and NB2)

f)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor was aware of self-service statements. (D46)

g)   That statements would be vetted by South Yorkshire Police legal representatives prior to
     them being forwarded to West Midlands Police. (D48, DD1)

h)   That Counsel for Lord Justice Taylor requested statements be made by officers from other
     forces to the criteria adopted by South Yorkshire. (D51)

i)   That it was made clear to officers when statements were requested from them that they
     would be subjected to vetting by solicitors prior to being forwarded to West Midlands Police.
      (DD2, DD5).

j)   That requests from West Midlands Police for officers' statements were recorded, that
      arrangements were made for the statements to be obtained, they were forwarded to
      solicitors for vetting and the solicitors comments were retained. (DD3, DD4, DD5, DD6 and
      DD7)

k)    That the requests for statements, the forwarding of them for vetting and returned comments
      can be married together. (DD2 and DD3 with DD4; DD6 with DD7)

I)   That on 23 May 1989 therefore was circulated about amendments to statements, following
      concerns expressed by some officers. (D62)

m)    That updated guidance on statement content was given to officers along with the request
      for their statement. (DD8)

n)   That Treasury Solicitors acting for Lord Justice Taylor were aware of police officers initial
      submissions, amendments to them and the production of signed final versions and
      therefore by implication Lord Justice Taylor was also aware. (D90 and D91)

Once again I do not feel I can take this subject any further forward without actually interviewing
people involved in the process.

Norman Bettison (NB1 and NB2), now Assistant Chief Constable, West Yorkshire Police
and Chief Superintendent Donald Denton (DD1 to DD8), now retired.

The reference numbers are ones that I have given each document for ease of identification.
The documents from Chief Superintendent Denton’s file are merely a sample from a section
of the file marked "Original Copies of Requests for Recollections WMP." The file also
contains handwritten lists of statements sent to Peter Metcalf for vetting and handwritten
lists of statements sent to the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team. In addition the
responses from Peter Metcalf, Solicitor at Hammond Suddards are only a sample from a 3
inch thick file of responses regarding statements of officers.

good enough for the leg as to what is happening.           Whilst the ncrth stand

Marshall - Inspector White was believed in difficulties through the

CC - It does not mean that we should not be seeking to find the evidence and

CC - How do we proceed from here?

McKay - Have concentrated on securing evidence and setting up the machinery
ready to z; . Although we have interviewed one or two people we haven't taken
statements.  So far as the enquiry team is concerned - set down your
recollections over the next few days.  We should be doing that with officers
at the game.  Prepared a proforma to all officers.

CC - Very good point - all officers at the game to      make records of their
recollections.

McKay - Any other area I should be taking action?

CC - Paint the picture of what was taking place in the first instance -
identify those officers in the area - ask the officers to pull together their
recollections not only in terms of what they did but what they saw.

Mole - Value of stewards being seen.

McKay - Need to be doing   house-to-house enquiries, pubs, ambulance men     etc.
Should get early contact with whoever is running the enquiry.

CC - Identify the persons who were on that turnstile and ask the question what
were your perceptions of it, capture that, and direct the attention of the
enquiry team.

McKay - Should we be circulating Merseyside asking for officers who were' at
the club?

CC - The enquiry team will clearly do that (see the injured persons).  Rather
let the enquiry team see the injured people.  Need to pull out the evidence

Mr Metcalfe



I assume we will get the video and the other documents back.    Any

 briefs, accounts etc will remain privilege.   You ought to note that

 pocket notebook entries can be called for and must be produced.      I

 suggest at this stage that we don't call this present investigation an

 inquiry as such but that we look upon it as a gathering of evidence

 You should be careful not to use the word inquiry.
MR. WOODWARD   it may help ii we ico.-c upon ourseives as     he

               accused', we need new to gather as much information

               as we can, in the time that is available,     there­

               fore I ask you gentlemen to continue from the

               point: that you have already reached, which is no'

               me an feat in tne time that was avaiiabie to you,

               I ask you to cast your net as widely as you can,

               gather what you think myself or Mr. Metcalfe, in

               our most perverse mood may require of you, and get

               it together for whenever you can.

DCC            As to the scope of the enquiry, we focussed on a

               time up to about 3-15 or 3-30, do we need at this

               stage to focus on consequences?

MR. WOODWARD   Yes, I think so, why did somebody not do something

               might be a question?     Why did someone die when

               they ne e dn ’t have done?   It's those sorts of

               questions that we need to be aware of.

DCC            A s 'an example then, Ch. Supt. Duckenfield would

               need to- relate his account from the time of coming

               on duty up to the time that he eventually left

               duty, is that right?     (From Ch. Supt. Wain -

               reinforce this point at briefings)

MR. WOODWARD   Yes.

DCC            So we need all of this that has already been pre­

               pared, plus a summary of what happened thereafter?

MR. WOODWARD   Because there are these writs expected, we ougtj-t to

               have the information that is available now, to

               answer these ir. the ler.g term.
CH. SUPT. MOLE    But when does the incident finish?

MR. WOODWARD      I would suggest that your account, for example,

                 should be the tine you attended the ground to the

                  time you actually go home.    That would act as a

                 core for us to work from.     We would choose what we

                 want to leave in and what we want to leave out, and

                 where the emphasis should lie.

CH. SUFT. MOLE   But time scales go out of the window, I was there

                 ail that time and can't remember what I was doing

                 at any given time.

DCC              You can only really do what you can do.

MR. WOODWARD     Yes, that      doesn't matter, do the best you can.

                 Identification,    for example, may not be relevant,

                 but put it- in, and get one or two others who may

                 want to put all their thoughts and experiences of

                 that day down on paper, as a sort of catharsis^ to

                 do the same.

DCC              So who should be interview?     For example, there are

                 Specials, there were thousands of officers on duty

                 in total.   What we have done so far is ask for

                 accounts from all Inspectors and above who were on

                 duty that day, and also those officers of those

                 ranks who attended in response to Operations

                 Support (Action this)    Then for the PC's and

                 Sergeants, we have only actioned those who were at

                 the Leppings Lane end of the ground.              .

MR. WOODWARD     Yes, that's fine, we have to be sensible.
DCC


The main players in this are doing their own accounts is that O.K. or

would you rather someone take their statement.




Mr Woodward



It couldn't be better.   They can put all the things in that they want

and we will sort them out.




DCC




So as far as the aftermath is concerned a few of the major players

involved if they provided full accounts that would suffice?




Mr Metcalfe



Yes.   That would be fine.




There then followed a discussion about the trading of minutes with

Miss Nortcliffe.   This was agreed.




M r 'Woodward



What are the terms of reference for the tribunal?




Mr Metcalfe



I know but I haven't got them with me.
Chief Supt Wain




What about a deadline for this inquiry?




Mr Woodward




Your heading in the right direction. . Don't let up now.




Mr Metcalfe



We could be asked to submit papers by the 5 May.




Mr Woodward



Lets see what happens on Friday.   If I said the 10 May what would you

say?




Chief Supt Wain




We would have to work to the 10 May.




Mr Woodward



Right lets go for the 10 May, dependant on what happens on Friday.   I

would rather have the matter conducted properly rather than quickly, and

this will be stressed at the preliminary hearing on Friday.
Mr Metcalfe




Even if a couple of officers could give an account of afterwards that

would be something to work on.




Chief Supt Wain




Is there any special format for presenting the information?




Mr Woodward




As is this is more than acceptable.




DCC




What about indexing?




Mr Woodward




Don't worry about indexing yet.   It would help however if this was

transposed onto a word processor so that the thing could be moved

around.




Chief Supt Wain




It will be going onto the computer from tomorrow so we can do anything

we want with it then.
 Mr Woodward




As a final point: I would like it to be passed to your officers that

anyone can tell Mr Metcalfe in confidence anything they want.       Any

observations on how or why the incident happened.      They can place this

information in a sealed envelope and send it to Mr Metcalfe or sent it

through you or telephone Mr Metcalfe and tell him.      (Raise at

briefings ).




DCC




'And is this privileged information?




Mr Woodward




Yes, I wouldn't want to inhibit officers from feeling able to answer the

question of how and why the event occurred so confidentiality is a vital

ingredient.




Mr Metcalfe




We must start then with self served statements and I can follow up on

any questions that I have that arise as a result of those.

    We discussed earlier today the provision, to the West Midlands
    Inquiry Team, of copies of the statements prepared by officers
    involved at the Leppings Lane end of the football ground on
    15 April.   You agreed to vet the initial batch of those
    statements.

    I enclose firstly a copy of the letter received from the West
    Midlands Police giving reasons for the request; a copy of a list
    of officers from whom statements are required; and a bundle of
    statements for Serials 13, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 19 as ticked on
    the list, for your perusal.

    No doubt you will advise me on the propriety of supplying these
    internal statements to the West Midlands Police.

                              HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY - STATEMENTS REQUIRED,

                A request has been received today from the West Midlands
                Enquiry Team for signed statements from the undermentioned
                members of the Mounted Branch.  All these officers have
                previously submitted reports for the information of the
                Chief Constable regarding their actions at Hillsborough.
                It is the intention to submit those reports for vetting by
                the Solicitors acting for the Chief Constable prior to release
                to the West Midlands Enquiry Team but they will not be so
                released unless the officer concerned gives his consent.   It
                may be that after vetting the Solicitors will recommend
                certain clarifications and the removal of matters of opinion
                which are not strictly evidence for the purpose of the Public
                Inquiry.  If the officers consent to release it is intended to
                produce the statements in typed'form for scrutiny and
                signature by the officer concerned.
                Would you please, as soon as possible, ensure that each officer
                is seen individually and consent or otherwise to release
                obtained, if possible before 9am Monday 15 May, 1989.

Ilis perceptions of the crowd position at page 5             do seem at odds with
moot other Officers;but, obviously, this should              not be altered if it
is his clear recollection.   I wonder what other             Officers he saw on
his walk down Leppihgs Lane and perhaps details              could be included.

20.7    C .1. Sumner         K \lo

  would suggest substitution of the words "extreme urgency" for
      .>* on page 4. |As a personal matter, he may wish to consider
’panic"
whether he wishes tp include the comment made to Mr. Lock on page 6.
Other Officers have;commented unfavourably on fans who asked whether
the game was going to re-start.

20.8    C.I. Creaser;

l believe that I haVe already been through a statement with Mr.
Creaser, but 1 do not know whether this is the original or an
amended version.      At all events, I feel that the comment, about the
packing of pens on page 4 should either be expanded to include
detail of when (in his experience) this had been done, or the entire
section deal.ing witfi this should be deleted.     On page 7, there is a
reference to a request to delay the kick-off.       It is indicated that
this request was noi acted upon, but can he say, with certainty,
that it was received.       If this is not within his own knowledge, then
l  think this comment should be deleted..     Comments on page 8/9 re: Mr.
Greenwood could, ej.t ter be expanded to indicate the nature of the
dii:i:icultj.es or orni 'ted after the factual comment that P.C. Goodwill
was., deployed as Communications Officer to Mr. Greenwood.

20.9    C;l.   Beal

This has been used as the basis for much of the background material
on planning for the:match.  I do not think that this should be
duplicated in the statement and, accordingly, would suggest the
statement should actually start at page 21, beginning with the words
"On 29th March .,

T think that the comment on page 5 to the effect that messages on
the air did not indicate the nature of the incident should either be
expanded on or deleted.

20.12   P.l. Bennett!
                       dv A
He may wish to    reconsider the            use of the word "louts" at page 3.

Whilst they probnb]^ were louts, some of them may claim to have been
trying to escape serious injury - a claim which will be difficult to
disprove.

T0:     Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Ops & Traffic         DATE:               2 June I989

           SUBJECT:                    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


           The West Midlands Inquiry team have now requested that     officers of your
           Division who are named in the attached schedules be asked to provide
           written accounts of their duties and activities relatingto the   FA Cup
           Semi-Final at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989-

           The written accounts, when obtained, will be subjected to the usual
           vetting procedures carried out by solicitors acting on behalf of the
           Chief Constable, prior to their submission to the West Midlands Police.

           Officers are being asked to co-operate in providing            their individual
           written   accounts, but the wishes of any officer              who  objects to
           disclosure will be respected.

           It is requested that the officers' accounts are:-

            1.    Handwritten in clear, legible writing.

           2.     Written on plain paper (not statement forms).

            3*    To include full name, age and date of birth,        rankand number, and
                  station.

            4.    To be factual accounts only - expressions of feelings, opinions,
                  hearsay evidence, etc, are not required.

            5.    To include Serial Numbers, where applicable,             and     details      of
                  specific duties, times and locations.

           6.     To be signed at the end of each page.     Corrections, alterations,
                  etc, must be clearly marked and initialled.

           Officers should take a copy" of their written accounts which they should
           retain for any future reference.

           There is an urgent requirement for the submission of these accounts,'and
           it is therefore requested that they be prepared, collated and submitted
           on a 'section1 basis to Detective Inspector Gunn, Hillsborough Incident
           Room, Force Headquarters, as soon as possible, and no later than Friday
           9 June 1989.

           Submissions should not be delayed due to the unavailability of
           individual officers through Annual Leave, Sickness, etc.       Separate
           arrangements will be made to obtain written accounts from such officers
           as soon as it is possible to do so.

           Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

  HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

   I am incensed that I should have to respond to a letter signed by Trevor Hicks, Chairman o f the
   Hillsborough Family Support Group to yourself, which I have received courtesy of the Liverpool
   Echo News Desk. I do not believe that such correspondence should be conducted via the media.

   We have bent over backwards to co-operate with the Hillsborough Family Support Group in the
   release o f information to them. As you know, we are constrained by Rule 57 o f the Coroners Rules
   1984 and by aspects o f confidentiality so far as statements are concerned which do not fall within
   Rule 57. These constraints are particularly noticeable when we correspond with the author o f a
   statement who seeks release o f documentation to the Hillsborough Family Support Group or to
   other families. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is fully aware of our policy. We have also been at pains to
   be completely open with the Scrutiny Team, promptly supplying any documentation requested.

   The letter writer is being disingenuous in suggesting that it is the fault o f South Yorkshire Police
   that the Hillsborough Family Support Group and individual families cannot meet the time scales for
   submissions to the Scrutiny. If the Group wish more time to make their submissions, o f course it is
   a matter for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in consultation with yourself. Certainly South Yorkshire
   Police would not resist that proposition but we strongly object when the reason for the extension is
   laid at our feet.

   Neither would I object to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's taking custody and control o f the Hillsborough
   evidence and documents. I have made this perfectly clear to the Judge. The volume o f the archive,
   however, the time for its transportation and the fact that the Judge is unlikely to be able to afford
   dedicated staff to access the material, will combine to make delivery o f information from the
   archives take more time than at present rather than less.

    Moving now to the four examples used by Trevor Hicks to highlight the problems encountered:-

    1.         The writer o f the letter - dishonestly in my view - makes no mention o f the fact that four
               important photographs received by the Group on 6 November 1997 were also accompanied
               by two that had been requested as late as 27 October 1997. Furthermore, within seven
               working days o f the original request, the Group's Solicitor had been supplied with laser
               copies o f three o f the photographs and an original photographic copy o f one of them. At this
               time it was made clear that there would be a delay in providing photographic copies, though
               we had acted in good faith in providing the best copy versions of the photographs available
               at the time.

2.     As to the allegation that families are still waiting to receive all or part o f their relatives' body
       files - this is simply wrong. No family is waiting to receive all or part o f body files. A body
       file is a complex bundle o f documents varying from 30 to 100 pages, depending on the
       amount o f evidence gathered, made more complex by the presence o f photographs and
       ANACAPA analytical charts. Two families are waiting for actual photographs from the
       body file as opposed to the laser copies we originally sent. You should know that, within the
       last two weeks we have received no fewer than eighteen word-processed, identically worded
       requests from different families, who in the main have had no previous contact with South
       Yorkshire Police, to supply a copy o f their deceased's body file to the solicitor acting fo r the
       Hillsborough Family Support Group. This figure represents 72% o f the requests previously
       received during the period from April 1992 to the end o f September 1997. Staff are
       presently processing these requests and the majority will be dealt with this week. If I
       indicate that some o f these stereotyped requests have earlier names crossed out and new
       names written in, you will appreciate our doubts about the motives behind the demands (a
       sample is attached for your interest).

3.     Without the courtesy o f further information I am unable to comment on access to medical
       records being denied to the Hillsborough Family Support Group solicitor.

4.     Again we are not sure precisely which medical records the Hammonds have been told did not
        exist yet which have been made available to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. I can be certain
        however, that M r Hammond has been supplied with all the statements from his late son
        Philip's body file, including the autopsy report supplied as long ago as 8 May 1992, which
        have been supplied to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. Any purported failure to supply records
        would be patently 'out o f synch' with all we have done so far.

South Yorkshire Police and its officers are as interested in the outcome o f Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's Scrutiny as the Hillsborough Family Support Group, and look forward to its conclusion. We
have no wish to leave any room for doubt to be cast in future, which is why we have put so much
effort, despite some inevitable legal constraints, into providing material when we have been asked
for it.

Though Trevor Hicks has lent his name to the letter, I would be surprised if Ann Adlington were not
the author o f it. It has all the hallmarks, ironically, o f the delay and prevarication attributed to the
South Yorkshire Police. This is at its most obvious in the final paragraph where, at least four
months into the process o f the Scrutiny, they seek to challenge its early announced terms o f
reference. My feeling is that this is simply because the existing framework is unlikely to have yielded
the 'successes' o f which they had built up expectations. Though the butt o f allegations o f 'dirty
tricks' emerging from some quarters close to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, may I
reiterate my complete commitment to openness - even if it should be to the detriment o f our Force -
and to the repeated expression o f my sorrow at the awful consequences o f 15 April 1989. Nothing
will ever change those two aspects o f my life or my relationship with the Hillsborough Family
Support Group

                 Dear Mr Straw,

                 re_: Hillsborough Scrutiny

                 i s is with deep regret that we feel we have no alternative but to write to you to seek your
                 intervention in the timetable for the scrutiny. Since your announcement o f the scrutiny on the
                  <0WJune the problems o f slow or non-disclosure o f information by South Yorkshire Police
                 naci others have continued unabated.. It is o f such scale and regularity as to render any
                 arguments o f mistake, oversight or pressure o f work totally untenable. We believe it is a
                 deliberate tactic to disadvantage the families and is clearly a cynical attempt to influence the
                 outcome o f the scrutiny.

                 We have already made direct representation and ensured the problems were known to Lord
                 Justice Stuart Smith’s team / the Home Office but despite small temporary improvements, ail
                 our attempts to gather information vital to proper presentation o f our case are being thwarted.

                 You will recaU irom our meeting at the Commons that families expressed concern that custody
                 (and apparently control!!) o f the evidence /documents should remain with South Yorkshire
                 Police when clearly their role in and after the disaster is central to the scrutiny.
                 Rather than the spirit o f “openness” so vigorously espoused by New Labour the continuation
                 o f the problems o f the last eight and a half years is realising our worst fears.

                  f ht*y appear to have absolute power to determine what we see and when, if ever, we see it.
                 f! cannot be right, fair or just that they have the scope to manipulate the proceedings by denial
                 or delay o f in formation.

                 i'xamples o f the problems we are encountering are:-

                 ;) As late as the 6UI November we received four important photographs - they were requested
                 over three months ago!!!

2)Sevcrai families are still waiting to receive all or parts o f their loved ones “bodyfiles”

3 )On the 24th September our solicitor was denied access to medical records despite having
written authority from the relatives concerned. Access is still being denied!!

4)Medical records o f the late Phillip Hammond have apparently been made available to Lord
Stuart Smith when the Hammonds have always been told such records did not exist.

The initial “deadline” for submissions was I*1September but this had to be relaxed when it
bccame clear that South Yorkshire Police did not begin to comply with requests for
Hiformaiion until late August. The HFSG made preliminary submissions mid-September and
lodged others on the 25* September. Both o f those documents made it dear that our efforts
were being hampered by the painfully slow information release by South Yorkshire Police.

Clearly if the scrutiny attempts to report “at the turn o f the year” full consideration o f newly
disclosed evidence cannot take place and hence it could not form part o f any deliberation or
conclusion.

11 is our belief that Lord Justice Stuart Smith should take possession and control o f all the
J<>cuments/cvidence to safeguard their integrity and ensure proper and timely disclosure to all
parties. Surely, no one can have greater claim to the truth than the families o f the deceased.

We further submit that it is now imperative that you extend the timescale for submissions'and
i heir proper consideration by the Judge if the scrutiny is to be accepted by the families and the
public as fair and exhaustive.

 All o f us want this matter concluded, but having waited for so many years the families implore
you to introduce a one or two month extension to the timescale to ensure all our concerns can
be properly investigated and “scrutinised” . It is the families view that this is our last chance
for justice to be done and clearly it must be “seen to be done properly” if faith in the judicial
process is to be regained by the many thousands o f voters who wrote to you, attended the
justice conccrt, and wrote/telephoned the media in support o f our cause.

We shall be writing under separate confidential cover regarding deep concerns relating to the
Terms o f Reference you have set down for Lord Justice Stuart Smith and these may also give
rise for revision o f the scrutiny programme.

EVIDENCE OF POLICE SERGEANT TREVOR BICHARD
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :    It is very good of you to come and
2          see me.      I have, of course,       read your evidence both at the
3          Taylor Inquiry and at the i n q ue st.         There are one or two
4          things that I would like to try to clarify a little bit.
5          I am sure you have had a chance to read through the
 6         evidence you gave on those two occasions?
 7   A    Yes,   sir.
 8   Q    It has been a long time now and it              must be quite difficult
 9         for you to remember.        One of the things I am interested in
10         is this question of the malfunction - if that is the
11         correct word - of camera 5.            You know what I mean by
12         camera 5, the one mounted by the scoreboard.                If I can
13         remind you of what you said to Lord Taylor.                You told him
14         there had been a problem and Mr. Holdswurth had been
15         working on it that day.        I am referring to page 43.            You
16         said that on that particular day the quality had been
17         improved.      It was not up to the mark but it was a lot
18         better than it had been.       "We      were getting pictures.       That
19         is the best way of describing           it."    I think that is the
20         main thing that you said about the quality of the pictures
21         on that occasion.      Can you just expand to me what was
22         wrong with the pictures?
23   A    The monitor in the       control room I would describe as being
24         misty or foggy.      What had been happening was that the
25         quality of the picture ----
26   Q    Just to stop you.        I will get the pictures of the screens
27         in the control room.        (Indicating)        There we are.    When
28         you are talking about the monitor,             what are you talking
29         about?
30   A     The numbers above them represent the camera,               and the
31         monitor at the Leppings Lane end          is      there.
32   Q    That is on continuously?
33   A    Yes.
34   Q    Showing whatever it is camera            5 ispointing at?
35   A    Yes.
36   Q     As I understand it, if you want to transfer what is being
37         seen on that to one of these two, you can do that by
38          flicking a switch.      Was it one of these things here?



                                             2
 1    A   That is right.        There is actually a selection system for
 z.       the consequential pictures.           You select a particular tape.
 3    Q   So when you are talking about a monitor not being very
 4        good, you are talking about the number 5 screen,                    under
 5        number 5?
 6    A   That is r i g h t .
 7    Q   Not what you see       on here?
 8    A   No.
 9    Q   Now, what was the problem with the number 5 screen,                   if
10        that is right?
11    A   The quality of the picture was misty - foggy,                 and    the
12         standard of the picture would get worse the longer the
13         screen was on.       I would describe it as you would alter the
14         contrast on a television;        a whitening and darkening
15         effect.     In this case it was a whitening of the screen.
16    Q   Is this the same thing as flare?
17    A   Very similar to flare.
18    Q   That had been worse previously,           had it?
19    A   Yes,   the problems had occurred over a number            weeks.
20         Certainly in the morning when           I arrived   it was very       bad.
21         Roger Holdswurth improved        itto    a workable    level but
22         certainly not to the standard it could have been.
23    Q   Was it as good as these - 1, 2, 3 and 4?
24    A   No.
25    Q   No. 2 was the colour one?
26    A   No.    3 is the colour one.
27    Q   I thought it was no. 2.
28    A   It is one of those rare things that I feel confident
29         about, but I am not going to bet on it.
30    Q   This is the plan.        Camera 1 is this one here;            the West
31         stand looking towards Leppings Lane.            Right?
32    A   I am not sure on numbering.
33    Q   I have known that as no. 1.           That is the no. 2.        This        is
34         the colour one.        That is the colour one,        isn't it, on the
35         South stand?
36    A   That is certainly the coloured monitor,              but my
37         recollection was the colour monitor was no. 3.
38    Q   This one is no. 4.        That has always been referred to as
39         no. 4 as far as I am concerned,           Penistone Lane.          This


                                            3
1        black and white one here is referred to as no.         3. May be
2        you think those two are interchangeable.       I do not think
 3       it matters very much for present purposes.       Can we refer
4        to this one,     the colour one?
 5   A   Shall we refer to it as "the colour one"?
 6   Q   I am calling this one no. 2 and this one no. 3.         That is
 7       the other one in the South stand.      You say that the
 8       quality of what you were seeing on no. 5 screen was not as
 9       good as you were seeing on no. 1 screen?
10   A   That is right.
11   Q   When it got transferred to these recording monitors,          was
12       there any difference then between the quality of the
13       picture that you were getting from say, camera 1 and
14       camera 5?
15   A    I am not really sure of the answer to that.       My only
16       definite recollection is looking at 5 and dealing with 5,
17       and the tendency would be to switch to what you wanted to
18        record,   but I would not really concentrate on what was
19        shown.
20   Q   On the recording monitor.     You would be looking at the
21        original screen?
22   A   The two monitors there are useful for people who are
23        working in the control room to be able      to see.      To see    the
24        top ones you would have to stand right      back to see i t .
25        Certainly the lower monitor was more a c c e ss ib le.    Nobody
26        working on the front row could actually see.
27   Q    I see.     So far as I can make out from what you are saying,
28        it was    more a problem with the screen than the camera.           Is
29        that right?
30   A   I do not really know the technical answer to that,         but
31        certainly Roger Holdswurth was working on the camera in
32        the morning of the event.     Where the actual problem lay,          I
33        cannot really answer that.
34   Q    So far    as seeing what was going on on the terraces,       on the
35        West terrace,    everybody in the control   room as far as I
36        can see would have been looking out of      the window?
37   A   Yes.
38   Q   They would not be looking at your screen 5, would they?




                                        4
1    A   The tendency,    because they have not got such a good view
2        inside the ground,    they were quite happy to look through
3        the windows.     The only time there was an interest in the
4        monitors was if the fans were doing anything.
5    Q   As if somebody said "There is something going on over
 6       there,   will you train on that?"
7    A   More along the lines of if something        was happening   outside
 8       the ground I would draw attention to i t .
 9   Q   What do you mean by that?
10   A   On Penistone Road.
11   Q   What I am calling camera 4?
12   A   I would then draw the attention of whoever was in           charge.
13   Q   Because you are the eyes for outside        the   ground;   they are
14        the eyes for inside the ground.        Others in the control box
15       would be eyes for inside the ground.         Is that the correct
16       way of putting it?
17   A   I would say responsible across the board for five minutes
18        which included both inside and outside the ground.          People
19        at the front had the advantage of being able to see the
20        live action through the windows.        My view was quite
21        restricted from the back of the control box which was
22        rather small at that time, and it was limited usually to
23        the monitors.    Where you actually stood at the back was
24        elevated.   When I am stood up my eyes are all level with
25        the monitors at the front.         The picture does not give you
26        the correct perspective t h e r e ..
27   Q   You were asked at some stage - I think both at the inquest
28        and Lord Taylor's inquiry - as to whether when you first

29        noticed something was wrong in pens 3 and 4, when you saw
30        people climbing out, whether you saw that all through the

31        windows or on the screen,     and you said you could not
32        remember?
33   A   That is right.
34   Q   I do not suppose you can remember more clearly now?
35   A   Not with any confidence to say to you, hand on heart,           that
36        I positively saw it on the screen.         From the position I

37        was in at the back of the control room makes it very

38        difficult to look out of the windows.        I had to make a




                                         5
1        conscious effort to bend down, and my eyes are therefore
2        using c a m e r a s .
3    Q   I wonder if I can try to get your help as to where these
4        various cameras were focusing.           If need be we can look at
 5       your exhibits TB1 and 2.          First of all,    can you help me
 6       with this.       Do you know which of the monitors TB1 comes
 7       from and which TB2 comes from?
 8   A   They relate to the tape players rather than actual
 9       monitors.
10   Q   Do you know which is TB1 or 2?
11   A   No.
12   Q   It might be either of these two?
13   A   No,   I cannot say for certain.
14   Q   You do not now remember which is which?
15   A   Not which one the tape came out of.
16   Q   TB1 up to 1430 is camera 1 and is showing scenes outside
17       Leppings Lane.          Is that right?
18   A   Right.
19   Q   From 1436 TB1 goes inside the ground.          It is the kop end
20        and it is the colour camera which I am calling camera 2.
21       At 1458 that camera swings on to the West terrace and you
22        see scenes at that end and you are moving the camera about
23        and zooming it and so on.         From that moment I would say
24        you are concentrating on operating that colour camera?
25   A   Yes.
26   Q   And that tape ends at 4 minutes past          3?
27   A   Yes.
28   Q    So far as that tape is concerned,         it is camera 1 up to
29        1436,   and camera 2 thereafter.        First down the kop end and
30        then at 2 minutes to 3 you obviously notice something at
31        the inside and you swing the camera round to focus on the
32        Leppings Lane terraces?
33   A   Right.
34   Q    TB2.    Until 2 minutes past 3 that is focusing on what is
35        happening outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles,           and it is
36        on time lapse,         and then clearly camera 1 at 1502:53 goes
37        inside the ground.         There are clearly shots taken by
38        camera 5, and they are shots of the perimeter fence and
39        people climbing out.          It appears to be focused in one


                                            6
1        position.      That is to say, you are not moving it about or
2        manipulating it in any way.              It is on time lapse.      Looking
 3       at it on the monitor,         it ispretty poor quality and         you do
4        not get very much help from              it.   At 1525 it changes to
 5       what I have called camera 3, the other black and white
 6       camera.    It is long range shots of the goal from that
 7       camera.      It is on time lapse,        of poor quality and ends at
 8       1535 or 1534.         I   would like to show you that in due
 9       course.      I would      like your confirmation that I have got
10       that r i g h t .
11              There is one other piece of information that I should
12       tell you.          That is that between 1418 and 1422 roughly
13       camera 5 is focusing on what I think is probably pen
14       number 2 but again you can probably help               me about that.
15       There was an incident which              you referred to in your
16       evidence before Lord Taylor of somebody apparently
17       misbehaving down          the front.     It was when
18       was in the box.           You clearly bring the camera down on to
19       that pen and we can see close ups of what is going on in
20       that pen.          There is nothing else recorded from that camera
21       until 1502,         so there is nothing recorded between something
22       like 1423 and 1502.           Can you help me where that camera 5
23       was and what you would be seeing on screen 5 during that
24       time?     What I want to know is would it have remained - did
25       it remain - where you left it at 1423 on pen 2?                 Or did
26       you bring it into some other position?               Or can't you
27       remember?
28   A   I would not be able to remember that.              You hit on a
29       significant point in your summary there in that when the
30       camera is moving,         panning,     tilting or zooming in, quite
31       clearly I am in control of the system.               If,   from the time
32       you have mentioned,         camera 5 is not being recorded,         it is
33       because I am looking at another camera and recording other
34       events which most probably between 230 and 3 o'clock are
35       events on the rear of Leppings Lane.
36   Q   Until you are concentrating on the kop end just before 3
37       o'clock.       So may be you cannot answer the question.
38       Perhaps when we look at the bit between 1418 and 1422 you
39       can see whether or not you think it would have remained in


                                              7
1          that position,    or whether you would have put it somewhere
 2         else.     You cannot remember particularly where it was,         is
3          that the position?     You cannot really remember now where
4          it was?
 5   A     No,   there is no way that I could recall where that was.
 6   Q     What I would call camera 3, the other black and white        one
 7         on the South stand,    that so far as I can see does not come
 8         into play down on the Leppings Lane end until 1525.         Can
 9         you remember where that would have been up until that
10         time?     There was a problem at the kop end just before         3
11         o 'clock?
12   A     I recollect certain problems on the kop.         The timing of
13         it,   I thought, was a little bit earlier on than that.
14         Certainly there had been problems.
15   Q     You have got the colour camera on that end at 143 6 until
16          1458.    I would rather expect that the black and white
17          camera, which I gather was a very powerful one, would have
18         been concentrated on the kop end while that trouble was
19          going on, but I do not know.
20   A     It is 1518, when the one you refer to as camera 3, starts
21          to move.    It would have remained.    The position you first
22          see it move since the last time it was activated would not
23          relate to the events on the kop when we are using a colour
24          camera to monitor the same a r e a .
25   Q     I am not sure that quite answers the question.        The first
26          time that camera 3 - that is the black and white one at
27          the kop end or South stand - can be identified as coming
28          into use is when TB2 shows it coming round and fixing on
29          the Leppings Lane end.    Where do you think it was before
30          then?    Do you think it would have been focusing that end
31          or do you think it would have been on the kop?
32   A     As soon as that camera starts moving,     it moves from the
33          kop down to Leppings Lane.
34   Q     I do not think you can see it focusing on the k o p .      All
35          one sees is that it suddenly starts recording at the
36          Leppings Lane end.
37   MR.   BONE:     I think that is right,   Sir Murray.
38   A     We are saying the camera has been moved prior to recording
39          and then switched on.


                                         8
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
2    A     Without that as guidance,     I cannot answer that.
3    Q     I will tell you why I said this.          Mr. Holdswurth has told
4          me - and I think there isn't any doubt about this - that
5          in the club control room there is a monitor which enables
 6         people in the club room to switch over to what you are
 7         seeing on some of your s creens.          I am not sure whether it
 8         was all of them or four of them.
 9   A     I have never had any involvement with the club system.
10         The only thing I can say with any certainty is that I or
11         the staff in the control room have no access to any of the
12         pictures.
13   Q     That I do know.      I understand that.       What Mr. Holdswurth
14         says is that he was from time to time looking at what the
15         position was inside the ground by turning on to your
16         cameras,    and specifically at about the time gate C opened
17         at 1452 he looked inside the ground at the Leppings Lane
18         terraces.     He   says he could see      - and it is not clear
19         whether it is      from cameras 5 or      3 (he seems   to think it
20         might have been either or both)           - that pens 3 and 4 were
21          overcrowded.      That is what he now says.       He has never said
22          it until quite recently.
23   MR.    COOK:   I am sorry - what time was that?
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Probably from about 1452 I would
25          say.    I do not know whether you can help me about this.
26          There is no record of that,          so the question is whether
27          cameras 5 and 3 may have been focusing on that end so that
28          he could see something.      I do not know whether you can
29          help about that?
30   A      Unfortunately,    it is just something I could not answer.
31          This is the first I ever heard that he had access to the
32          pictures we were seeing.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think the best thing probably
34          is to show him.       I think we could show him the bit.          What
35          are you focused on at the moment?
36   MR.    BONE:   We are on TB1 and 2 at 1455.          I think we need to
37          see TB2 really.




                                             9
1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Yes, the 1418 bit.       I think we
2          could reel back to 1418 and start from there.             (Video
3          played)      We are looking at TB2 at the m o m e n t .
4    MR.   BONE:     I am going back to 1418 on this tape.
5    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         We are going to start at 1418.
 6         This is the kop end and this is the black and white camera
 7         presumably?
 8   A     Yes.
 9   Q     Which I am calling camera 3?
10   A     That is right.
11   Q     (1418:39)    This is camera 5, isn't it.
12   MR.   BONE:     Yes.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You do not know which pen you are
14         looking at?
15   A     That is what I would refer to as pen 2.
16   Q     Pen 2.    That is what I would have t h o u g h t .   A nd you   can
17         see a bit of pen 3 in the background?
18   A     Yes.
19   Q     This is the incident,       as I understand it, where it was
20          thought that one of these gentlemen was misbehaving?
21   A     Yes.
22   Q     I don't think there is any sign of         it inthe picture?
23   A     No, an incident took place and a camera was put            on to
24         monitor the behaviour.
25   Q     These are quite good pictures.         Of course,     it is a bigger
26          screen and we can show it to you on a smaller one if you
27          want to, but how does that compare with what you would be
28          seeing on your screen 5?
29   A     It gives you the glare you get off the            light surfaces.      It
30          was more exaggerated than that.         Again,    the camera is not
31          moving.
32   Q     No, but it does move.       We have already seen it move,          I
33          think.     Now, you could probably identify somebody at           that
34          distance,    couldn't you?
35   A     Yes,    that is what the camera was there for.
36   Q     That is 1420:25.       Is that the maximum zoom that you have
37          got?
38   A     I wouldn't know the answer to that.
39   Q     You are clearly still manipulating it,            aren't you?


                                            10
1    A     Yes.
2    Q     That is14:20:46.     You are still moving at 14.21:12.          So
3          what you are saying is what you would see on your screen 5
4          would not be quite as good as what might be seen on the
 5         monitor?
 6   A     Monitor 5.
 7   Q     The monitor which is    recording this?
 8   A     I cannot give you an    answer about the quality of the
 9         monitor.
10   Q     Looking     at the quality of this tape,   is it not too bad,        is
11          it?
12   A     No, no;      it is a reasonable quality.    It highlighted
13          obviously that a larger screen does give the allusion that
14          the standard of picture is a lot higher.       Bear in mind,        it
15          is probably half size.
16   Q      Yes.     We can look at it on a smaller screen. Now        we come
17          back to the kop end. (14.23:40) What I       would like to know,
18          if you can remember, is would you have       left camera 5 in
19          the position that we have just seen it, or would you have
20          moved it somewhere else and just left it parked,          or can't
21          you say?
22   A      It would be difficult for me to say with any certainty.
23          What I could say is that it would be unusual for me to
24          want to move it.     I would have just left it there because
25          I am moving on to concentrating on another i n c i d e n t .
26   Q      Yes,    that is what I would have expected. Anyhow,        we are
27          now on the kop end.
28   MR.    BONE:    Shall we now go on to 1502?
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Yes.
30   MR.    BONE:    I will fast forward to 1502.
31   A      Can I just ask a question about that?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes.
33   A      Between now and 1502,    that camera stays recording that --
34
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No, it goes outside Leppings Lane.
36          Would you like just to switch it on.       It is   1435 now and
37          these are scenes outside Leppings Lane.        It stays    at this
38          end until 1502.
39   A      Thank y o u .


                                         11
1    MR.   BONE:     I will now advance to 1502.           We start at 15.02:40
2          which is outside Leppings Lane again.
3    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Now you go inside again.
4           (15.02:57)    This is very curious.           Is that an example of
 5         flaring,    that very white ---
 6   A     My description of flaring is when you have a very bright
 7         light on screen which means the picture will lose it.               It
 8         could be from a bright light or a reflection off shirts.
 9   Q     But it was very light when it first started on that?
10   A     Yes.
11   Q     These pictures are of very poor quality.
12   MR.   COOK:     This is slow motion,          isn't it?
13   A     That is right.    This is not what I am seeing in real time.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         No,   I know.
15   MR.   BONE:     This is what is called freeze frame,          isn't it?
16   A      It was an extended play system on the camera which
17         multiplied it six times.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think I am right in saying that
19          from now on - and we had better perhaps run this through -
20          the camera remains in the same position?
21   A     Yes.
22   Q     In fact, because you are manipulating the other camera,
23          the coloured o n e .
24   MR.    BONE:    This camera is in a different position now than it
25          was the last time we saw it.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         At 14.22?
27   A     Yes.
28   Q     This is pen 3, I think,      isn't it?
29   A     Yes.
30   Q      Can you remember in what circumstances you switched it
31          from wherever it was before to this position?
32   A     No, not really.
33   Q     You do not know.        You cannot remember where it was before?
34   A     No.     Quite clearly from the video,          I had been operating a
35          camera looking up Leppings Lane and somebody saying
36          something or my attention is drawn to want to record
37          events in the terrace area of Leppings Lane.
38   Q     Yes, and particularly the perimeter fence?
39   A     Yes.


                                              12
1    Q     At some stage you swivel camera 5 on to that from wherever
2          it has been before?
3    A     At the beginning of the sequence there you actually saw me
4          starting to move the camera.
5    Q     Oh, did we?
6    A     And actually it swung about quite a lot and went out of
 7         focus.
 8   Q     Can we go back to t h a t .
 9   A     That suggests to me that I had just started to move it
10         then and was setting the pictures up.           (15.03:10)    There,
11         I am zooming in and coming out and trying to get in focus.
12   Q     Yes.    Where do you think it was before?
13   A     Can you just run it back.
14   MR.   BONE:    Yes.    Running back to 15.02:50 again.
15   A     The first shot there is an overview on the terraces.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :     Is it possible that camera 5 had
17         been looking on giving        an overview of the terraces before
18          you moved it on to this?
19   A     It is quite possible.
20   Q     Possible.      That would mean that after the       events that we
21          saw at 14.22 you must have put the camera somewhere else?
22   A     Moved it from looking at- the four in the pen, yes.
23   MR. BONE:      (15.07:49)    This   is about where we stopped before.
24   A     It is possible there,       the   first view we get is this
25          swinging across,     that something occurs on Leppings Lane
26          and I start to move the camera to look at those events and
27          then start the recording.        In other words, the camera could
28          still be settled down.        I just really cannot give you an
29          answer with any degree of certainty about where the camera
30          would b e .
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          You do not have any recollection of
32          it?
33   A     It was obviously necessary for me to get the camera in
34          position to what I am seeing          on pen 3, which suggests to
35          me it was not already on pen 3 otherwise I could have just
36          left it there and recorded events.          Again,    the first shots
37          that you get are just zooming in and out,            and it is in and
38          out of focus as well.        Again,   the shots,   if you think
39          about pen 2 earlier, were close up of people in there.              By


                                             13
1        just moving it on to pens 3 and 4, it is then going to
2        create the problem that I am going to have to re-focus,
3        readjust the picture,        to get it right,       because I have
4        moved from what would have been pen 2 , or what had been
 5       happening in pen 2, to the bigger picture on pens 3 and 4.
 6   Q   Am I understanding you correctly then,              that having seen
 7       this now, what it suggests to you is that between 1424 and
 8       1502 when you start to manipulate camera 5 again,                  it was
 9       in the same position as it was at 1424, or can't you say?
10   A   I cannot give you a positive answer about that.
11   Q   This bit of film from 1502 to 1525, was made up into                 a
12       separate clip for the purpose of the inquest.                It was
13       shown to the jury just before you gave evidence. Do you
14       remember that?       I don't know whether you do?
15   A   No.
16   Q   Have you got the transcript of your evidence at the
17        inquest?    It is page 80.      (Produced)         If you would just
18        look at the top of that page.         The coroner says:
19              "The film we saw this afternoon of the Leppings Lane
20              end which came from what I have called camera 1 - I
21              d o n 't know the camera number ---- "
22        You say:
23              "I call it camera 5."
24   A   Yes.
25   Q          "The one beneath or near the police box?"               (A)   "Yes".
26              (Q)   "That scene began at 1502.         This is what we have
27              just been looking at?"         (A)   "Yes,    sir."   (Q)   "Where
28              was that camera looking before 1502 as far as you can
29              recollect?"     (A)   "My recollections are that the
30              particular camera had been faulty,             and in fact you
31              saw some of the problems that occurred.               You were
32              getting what is called flare.           It is the reflection
33              of light coloured objects, and you lose the picture.
34              The camera was not really being used as much as it
35              would normally have been because of the substandard
36              pictures.     It was just left in position.           That is why
37              the picture never really moved at all, because it was
38              set and left in that position."




                                          14
1        Does that help you at all?             That is, in effect,          what you
2        have been saying to me this afternoon,                  I think,    isn't it?
3    A   Yes,   really.      That really covers exactly what I have been
4        saying.
 5   Q   When you were saying you saw some of the problems that
 6       occurred,    was that the bit that I was referring to when I
 7       drew your attention to it just now, that rather light
 8       coloured stuff?
 9   A   Talking about flare?
10   Q   Yes.
11   A   Yes,   that is right.
12   Q   Or was there something           else that    you had     inmind?
13   A   Not,   it was     a very sunny day;          a very bright     day,   and all
14       reflection off any light coloured objects,                   white shirts
15       etc,   caused problems.
16   Q   Then you go         on:
17               "That is what I am coming to.             Given that it started
18              at 1502,      let us assume I am right on that time.                  Was
19              that the time you moved it and located it and then
20              left it to take that shot?"              You say:      "No, that
21              probably would have been done before that."                    (Q)
22                "Would it have been recording before that?"                   (A)
23                "Yes."     (Q)    "So there ought to be a film of it prior
24               to that?"         (A)   "I would have thought so, yes."              (Q)
25                "Of that same scene?"         (A)   "Yes."
26        Then the Coroner says they have looked and they cannot
27        find it, and indeed it is not there.                 What you are saying
28        in that passage is slightly contradictory to what you have
29        just told me, namely,           that when you switch it to looking
30        over pen 3 , that is the first time that you operated that
31        camera.     Do you follow?
32   A   Right.
33   Q   What you appear to be saying here is that you think you
34        must have operated the camera a little before the pictures
35        we have just seen, do you follow?
36   A   I shall need to look at this because it is somewhat
37        confusing,       sir.




                                               15
 1   Q   I think what you told the Coroner may          have been mistaken.
 2       Just read it through. Read through from the top of the
 3       page to yourself again.           (Pause)
 4   A   Can I just work        it down?
 5   Q   Yes.
 6   A   Quite clearly,      the initially questions are establishing
 7       that we are referring to camera 5, Leppings Lane Terrace.
 8        (Q)   "So where was the camera looking before 1502 as far as
 9       you can recollect?"         (A)   "My recollections are     ...    " I
10       don't really answer the question,           do I?
11   Q   No.
12   A   Then I go on about flare.
13   Q   You do say it was just left in that position?
14   A   It was left in that position at 1502.           "Given    that it
15       starts at 1502,        let us assume that we are right       at the
16       time.    Was that      the time you moved it and located it and
17       left it to take        that shot?"     Clearly from what     we have
18       seen on there,      I move the camera for certainly a few
19       seconds before it settles in that position,              and it appears
20       to me that what I am saying is no, that would have been
21       done before.      In other words,      the movement,     before it
22        settles in the position,         I have done the moving round and
23       decided where to put it. If you like,           I am talking
24       probably about the few moments before it settles rather
25       than perhaps from the previous half an hour.               Does that
26       make any s e n s e .
27   Q   I don't know.     My own feeling is that you may          be mistaken
28       here because what we have just seen,           as you have
29       confirmed,    is the camera moving and focusing on this pen
30       3, the perimeter fence, and it then stays there.                  As you
31       told me a little while ago, you thought that you had moved
32        it from its previous position into that, and that is
33       recorded.     What you appear to be saying here is that you
34       may have moved the camera before the shots we see
35       recorded,    and that if you did do that there should be a
36       recording of it.         There isn't a recording of it.
37   A   Therefore,   I wasn't using the camera.
38   Q   That is what I would have thought.           So do you    now think
39        that you were probably mistaken in the bit between D to E?


                                           16
 1   A     I think the issue is I was probably confused by what was
 2         being said,     and what I am trying to convey is that if I am
 3         using the camera,       I would usually be recording that.               If
 4         you like, you see an incident ----
 5   Q     You would switch       over to record straightaway,         would you?
 6   A     Yes,    to record.     It is not impossible to be looking at an
 7         event without bothering to record it,               if you like,    to
 8         evaluate i t .     What I think I am trying to convey there is
 9         that if it is recorded and there is movement of the actual
10         camera controls, you know,         I am using it, monitoring         it;
11         if it is just static there then                I am doing something else.
12   Q     I am not sure I quite follow this.               We know that from this
13         time onwards you are operating the colour camera,                  and
14         camera 5 is just part of that position, but you must have
15         moved camera 5 from wherever it was before.                   We can see
16         the actual movement.
17   A     Some of the movement,       yes.
18   Q     Before we get these shots.              It    seems to me as though what
19          you said to the Coroner here on this point is probably not
20          correct.     As the Coroner says, we have looked and there
21          isn't any tape.       You say you would expect there to be tape
22          if you had moved it earlier?
23   A      Yes,    if I was using the camera I would have expected it to
24          have recorded.
25   Q      I think that has cleared that up, don't you?
26   MR.    BONE:     I think it has,   Sir Murray.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Perhaps we would like just to look
28          at the other tape, T B 1 .
29   MR.    BONE:     We have set this to run from 1455.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         If I can just tell you what the
31          sequence is - I have told you already, but I don't suppose
32          you will remember - up to 143 5 this shows scenes outside
33          Leppings Lane from camera 1.                At 1436 it goes inside the
34          ground,    the kop end,   in colour which I am calling camera
35          2, which is the one nearest you on the South stand?
36   A      That is r i g h t .
37   Q      And we will pick it up there and we will see what happens.
38          (14.54:55)    It looks as though the camera is parked at this
39          time,    isn't it?


                                              17
 1   A       Yes,    there appears to be no movement in it.
 2   Q       Probably because you were concentrating on Leppings Lane.
 3   MR.     BONE:     Shall I fast forward.
 4   LORD JUSTICE S T UART-S M I T H :          Yes, you can for a minute or two,          I
 5           think.      Still the same scene,             isn't it.
 6   MR.     COOK:     That is the Leppings Lane terraces?
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            No, this is the kop end.
 8           (14.58:43)       Now you are swinging round,              going through the
 9           North stand,      and there you are coming round on to the
10           Leppings Lane end.           (14.59:04)        That is actually looking
11           at pen 2, I think, mainly,                isn't it?
12   A       No,    I think that's pen 4.
13   Q       Pen 4, I am sorry.
14   MR.     BONE:     We are looking into the gap which is represented by
15           pen 5 before we get to pen 6 .
16   A        (14.59:55)      I am following Chief Inspector              Mike   who has
17           just left the control box.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            You are clearly operating this
19           camera now,      aren't you?
20   A       Yes.
21   Q       And when you are operating it, I imagine your full
22           attention is devoted to it, is it?
23   A       Yes,    that's right.
24   Q        (15.01:11)      Can you say whether that             ismaximum     zoom?
25   A       Yes,    it is.
26   MR.     BONE:      (15.02:30)      Camera moves to take scenes behind the
27           goal.     Long s h o t .
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            It finishes at 1503.        It is quite
29           plain that you are manoeuvring that camera right up until
30            the tape ends?        That is right, isn't it?
31   A       Yes,    certainly we moved out to the centre of the centre of
32            the goal at 15.02:30.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            Yes.     Chris, we hadn't actually
34            looked at TB3 and T B 4 , have we, or have you?
35   M R . BONE:       N o , I h a v e n 't .
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            It might be interesting to pick up
37            the start of those.
38       MR. COOK:    Does that continue on from the one we have just
39            seen?


                                                   18
1    LORD JUSTICE ST UART-S M I T H :          What happened was that you forgot
2           to replace the tapes,              didn't you?
3    A     T h a t 's r i g h t .
4    Q     And you didn't replace them until 1535,              I   think,    and then
5           you replaced both of them?
 6   A     Yes,     that's right.
 7   Q     We haven't actually looked at those yet.                 It might be
 8          quite interesting to see what we pick up on those at the
 9          beginning.
10   A     What I am interested about there is obviously we had times
11          displayed on our screen,              and the accuracy of those times
12          in real terms and in relation to each other - obviously
13          there are two tape             players, two time recording systems -         I
14          am just wondering.             Certain events we would be able to
15          identify a positive time may be from BBC or from other
16          factors,       but it may well be that there's differences on
17          the time display.            What I am looking at there,      for
18          instance,        is just after 3 o'clock clearly the players are
19          actually playing the game.
20   Q      They went on until six minutes past?
21   A      Just before 3 o'clock you see the linesmen moving about
22          and the game is in progress.                But you wouldn't expect the
23          kick-off to start until 3 o'clock.               Some of the times
24          displayed on the videos may be inaccurate.
25   MR.   BONE:        It is clear       from the BBC coverage which we have got
26          that the matched kicked off at half a minute before 3 -
27           2.59:30.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            I don't think you need bother about
29           that.      I think the times are pretty accurate.            They may be
30          half a minute out which is neither her nor there,                   is it.
31          Which is this,            Chris?
32   MR.   BONE:        This one is T B 3 .
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:                 That is camera 3 again,      isn't it?
34   MR.     BONE:      Yes.        This is the black and white one on the South
35           stand starting at 15.35:30.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H :            Apart from the fact that it is in
37           ordinary,       proper time now in stead of time lapse,            this is
38           the same as we were getting from this camera previously?
39   A       The one we were looking at previously was the colour one.


                                                   19
                     JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes,    I am sorry,    in the other tape.
1         LORD
2         A          The tape we have just seen.
                     No, not the tape we have just seen. The tape we have just
3         Q
                     seen was the colour one.  This is a continuation of TB2

                                                                           What
                     which at 1525 changed to camera 3, long range shots
5
6                    is this?
7         MR.        BONE:  This is TB2 at 1514.
                     JUSTICE STUART-S M I T H : Yes,        1525 is what we want to get
8         LORD
 9                   to
          A          That is the flare we talked about.
10
                     Here you are.     This is camera 3 on time lapse,                and it goes
11        Q
                     through I think with the camera fixed in that position
12
                     until 1534 when it e n d s .          When we go back to TB3 we pick
13
14                    it up again only not on time lapse.

15        A          Yes.
              MR.    BONE:   That is T B 2 , and this is T B 3 .
16
17            LORD JUSTICE ST U AR T-SMITH: Which starts at 153 5.
                   BONE:  Yes.    There are some gaps between TB2 and TB3 for a
18            MR.
                   few minutes, because TB2 finishes at about 1530, and this
19
                      one starts at about 153 5 , and they both show the same
20
21                 scenes.
              LORD JUSTICE S T UA R T-S M I T H :    Exactly the same scenes as we have
22
                      just seen.   I think speed that on a bit,             Chris,    until we
 23
                      get a change of scene.          We will have to look at this at
 24
                      more leisure,    but for the moment I am interested in the
 25
                      change of movement of the camera.
    26
                      BONE:  It changes at 15.57:50 to your previous view of pen
    27        MR.
    28                3 .
                      JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           That's right,       isn't it?
    29        LORD
    30        A       T h a t ’s right, yes.
                      BONE:      The camera seems to be moving a bit,            doesn't it,     in
    31         MR.
    32                 and out?
                       That is probably a problem with the tape.
    33         A
                       JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Have you any comment on the quality
    34         LORD
                       of that picture?       (15.58:20)
    35
               A       That's of reasonable quality.
    36
                       BONE:  (15.59.30)  Back to camera 3.                Then outside the
     37        MR.
                       ground at 15.59:40.          This is Penistone Road,          isn't it?
     38
     39        A       That is right,     yes.


                                                            20
1         I LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: I don't think                 we need trouble with
2                        that one any more.     Let us look   atT B 4 , shall    we?
3             MR.        BONE:    One we have not seen before.
4             LORD JUSTICE         STUART-SMITH:   No.
5             MR.        BONE:    TB4 starts at 15.34:52.     Itis    a colour camera.
6             LORD JUSTICE         STUART-SMITH:    It iscamera      2 again,isn't      it?
 7            MR.        BONE:    You obviously moved the camera since we last saw it
 8                       at 15 whatever?
 9            A          Yes.
10             q          You are panning along the North stand here,           going that way
11                       towards the gymnasium?
12            A          Yes.
13             q          m fact, you are at the Penistone Road end          of the ground
14                        now.   There is the ambulance coming at 15.35:40.
15                        (15.36:30)   This is the incident with the fans running
16                        towards the Nottingham Forest end because of the             things
17            I           they were chanting at them.
18                LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It seems to me pretty clear that
19                        you have been operating this colour camera ever since the
20                        moment you switched it over at 14.58.        Don't you think?
21                A       Yes,   I mean the previous pictures show camera 5 set on the
 22                       fence and definitely not in use.
 23                Q      And this one,    camera 2, is being moved all the        time,      isn't

 24                       it?
 25                A       Yes, unfortunately there is a void in recording.
 26                q      Yes, but I think it is probably safe to assume             that in
 27                       that void you were operating this camera?

    28             A    Yes.
    29             LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I don't know whether we need to

    3     0                look at any more.
    31             MR.    BONE:   I don't think we do, Sir Murray.         Unless you want
    32                     to see some of it on a small screen.         Do you wish to

    33        I            pursue that?
    34             MR.    COOK:   Are you saying the picture quality is worse on a
     35                    smaller screen?
     36            A      you will appreciate that this is a larger screen and gives
     37                    you a nice, perfect picture in this        nice cold hindsight
     38                    environment,    but sat there on the day w ith the emotions




                                                         21
     and events taking place and other things that's going off
     around you,   it was a very, very busy control room.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I quite appreciate that. What I am
     trying to get a picture of is what you yourself were
     concentrating on,    and it looks to me as though you were
     concentrating on what was happening outside the turnstiles
     of Leppings Lane until shortly before 3 o'clock,      and that
     you then switched to this colour camera at 1458 when you
     see things happening inside the ground,     two,   three or four
     minutes later you switch to camera 5 on to the same thing
     but seeing it from a different angle.      You leave camera 5
     parked there for quite a considerable time and you are
     operating camera 2 , the colour camera,    for the next half
     hour or so?
A    Operating the colour one, yes.
Q    I will just read you something     that Mr. Holdswurth said,
     and I am referring to page 9 of the transcript of his
     evidence the other day to m e :
           "It was through experience and knowing the ground and
           what usually did occur on this type of scenario,      not
           when the gate was opened obviously because that      was
           the first time that ever    happened, but when the   two
           central pens which were the main attraction points
           for fans, were full.    Normally,   what would happen was
           that they had a removable barrier that went across
           the tunnel where they used to put stewards and
           possible one or two policemen."
      This is the important bit:
           "It was when gate C was opened,     and observing
           primarily from cameras 3 and 5, that those central
           pens were full.     Then, because I had no video tape to
           record them,    I had no facility to record those.
           Primarily,    what I am referring to here is the static

           c a m e r a ."
      So he is saying he can see from cameras 3 and 5 that the
      central pens were full.     We have not been able to see
      anything of the sort from what is recorded,       and from what
      you have told me you do not recall really either of those
      two cameras being focused on pens 3 and 4 from 250
      onwards?
\     That  is true.      That is right, yes.       Could you just read
      the last part of what Mr. Holdswurth said there about the
      static camera.
2     That     is a reference to the club camera,          I think,   but he
      says - and there is no doubt that this is what he saying
      that he saw on the police cameras 3 and 5, that                 pens 3 and
      4    were full.    He hasn't said that until quite recently.
A     Can you    just clarify that.        What Mr. Holdswurth is
      suggesting is that from the club system he has had access
      to the pictures from all five cameras?
Q     Yes.We know that he has got access to, at any rate,                four
      of them.      I am not sure if he had to the colour one.
MR.   BONE:     He told us he could choose which one to watch.
A     So he would       have to select?
MR.   BONE:     Yes, he had a switch so he could choose.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:            And he was able to choose camera            1,
       and was in fact looking at our camera 1 for some time.                     At
          the bottom of page 14 I say:
               "Would this be right.   If one were to have a record
               of what camera 3 was doing in the ten minutes before
               3 o'clock,    say,    it would be focusing on the Leppings
               Lane terraces,       would it?"   Answer:     "Whether it was
               focusing there all the time,        or not,    I do not know.
               It was just that when we looked at it they had swung
               the camera away and then swung it around to Leppings
               Lane and one of the shots was a fairly wide angle,                  I
               would say about half zoom, which shows the central
               pen was quite full.        No 5 camera was parked in an
               area that you can see the central pens at a fairly
               wide angle.     It was taking the two.         It was not
               concentrating on one camera because,           as I say,       I had
               no control over the camera.         It was a case of
                switching between cameras."
          Then later on he s a y s :
               --It was showing the build up of the crowd.              You    c o u ld

                see that the central pens were full but there were
                spaces both this side of the pens and the far side,"
1                I have asked you about that and you have commented on i t .

2                Although you cannot remember now precisely where those

3                cameras were,    it doesn't look as though you agree with

4                what he is saying?
5                I am intrigued - and perhaps I have just not picked up the

 6               thread - he has got five monitors -- no, he has got one

 7               monitor and he switches.
 8       Q       That is right.
 9       A       When he says he could compare scenes on camera 5 and

10               camera 3 it is by switching?
11       Q       Yes.
12       A       Again,    the issue he has mentioned there about the wide

13               view,    and I think certainly within the transcript,     we had

14               passed comment about the wing pens being fairly empty.

15               That is measured up to the volume of people outside as

16               well.
17               Yes.  I mean,    everybody in the police control box could
         Q
18               see that pen 2 was pretty empty,     and they could see that

19               pens 3 and 4 were pretty full.       Do you think there is

20               anything else,    Chris?
21       MR.  BONE:  I don't think there is, Sir Murray, no.

22       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:  Is there anything else that you

23                want to tell me?
24       A        There are just two things that have come to mind.         It is

25                on record that I consider that camera 5 does not give you

26                the ability to see how dense the crowd is because of its

 27               position at a low angle looking across the heads of the

 28               crowd.    It creates an illusion,   not a 3-d picture.     You

 29               are looking at it in two dimensions.     If somebody is

 30               suggesting they could judge density from that through
                  mathematics or some scientific technique,     I am sure it
 31
 32               would not be an accurate way ----
                  It doesn't seem to me it is any better than looking with
 33          Q
 34               your eyes out of the window.

 35          A    That is quite true. You are getting the same effect.

    36       Q    From a slightly different angle.

             A    And again within transcript it says quite clearly,        because
    37
                  I was asked,    if you needed to get an accurate picture of
    38
                  the density, where would the camera have to be, and we are
    39


                                               24
1             talking about behind the goal looking down on the centre

2             pens.
3     Q       I follow that.
4     A       The other thing is we did talk about comments during

 5            inquest,    and I think it was page 80 we were referring to.

 6            What I was trying to convey to the inquest then was that

 7            if I am looking at events on a camera I would be recording

 8            it and I would expect a record to exist.           If it didn't

 9            exist,   it is suggesting to me that either I haven't

10            switched the recorder on or I was doing something else.

11            Perhaps that is not quite as clear.            On first reading,

12            what I am saying is not quite correct.           Perhaps I am just

13            not conveying what I was trying to s a y .
14    Q       I think we have clarified that a bit now, where you think

15            there should be some film about it.        I think you are

16            mistaken about that.      There isn't any?

17            No,   that's right,   there isn't any film.       What I am saying

18            is if I am looking at an incident,       I would expect to be

19            recording it.
20            Therefore, if there isn't a recording,          you are not looking
      Q
21            at it?
22            Yes.   It is just that it doesn't come across at the

23            inquest.     I have not made myself clear at the inquest what

24            I actually meant.
25    Q        I think it is clear to me now a n y w a y .

26    MR.     BONE:      I think the position would be if you are not

27            recording something then you are probably not looking at

28             it rather than definitely?
29    A        It is quite clear from events here that you look through

30             the times of events and incidents happening at Leppings

 31            Lane,   quite clearly the emphasis is what is happening at

 32            that place;     that is where the problem was and that is

 33            where I am watching.
 34       LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We could actually follow where your

 35            attention is directed,     I think,   throughout this period

 36            because you can see what the camera is doing?

 37       A    Yes.




                                             25
 1   Q     The only question is what is happening to the cameras when
 2         you are not looking at them or not looking at the s c r e e n s .
 3         Right,    do we need to look at the small screen.
4    MR.   BONE:     I think that is up to Mr. Bichard to say.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Do you want to look at the small
 6         screen?     My impression - I can tell you,       comparing TB1 and
 7         TB2 on the big screen and on the small screen - is that on
 8         the small screen it is slightly darker and slightly better
 9         definition in a way,    although,    of course,    it is not the
10         big picture,    but it is actually slightly clearer.
11   A     Are you looking at it on an actual black and white monitor
12         as well.
13   Q     Yes.
14   A     It would be a clearer picture than a colour screen.
15   Q     I am afraid I still don't quite understand why what             you
16         see on screen 5 is less good than what we see          on the
17         tapes.     You cannot really explain that?
18   A     There may be some technical explanation.
19   Q     You still think that is so.
20   A     I am just thinking there.     There is a suggestion by          Mr.
21         Holdswurth that there was not a fault with camera 5.
22   Q     No,    he doesn't say that.   He said there was a fault but he
23          cleared it.
24   A     Clearly,    there must be some record of the fault being
25          there from previous weeks,      and obviously there was a fault
26         because it was there first thing.
27   Q     There is no dispute that there was       a fault,    and there
28          isn't any dispute that he came to rectify it on the
29         morning in question.     The only issue,    I think,    is he says
30          it was working perfectly afterwards;       you say    it was
31          working, but it wasn't as good as it should have been?
32   A     Yes.     Again, when I looked at some    of the statements I
33          made,   the fault that was on     the camera,    I think I
34          described somewhere that it       was a progressive fault.       The
35          longer it is on, the fault actually gets worse,         and Mr.
36          Holdswurth may well have seen it first thing in the
37          morning and considered that       he had achieved a reasonable
38          picture there but the fault       progressively got worse
39          through the day.


                                         26
1    Q     What I think is being said now is             that the footage   which
2          we can see from camera 5, and we have looked at a certain
3          amount of it, doesn't show any significant difference
4          between that camera and the other cameras,              and I think you
 5         accept that?
 6   A     From what we have seen here,           yes.
 7   Q     Apart from that flaring.
 8   A     Apart from the flaring, yes.            The actual video recordings
 9         are of a comparable standard.
10   LORD JUSTICE S TU A RT-SMITH:       Yes, you are right.        There we are.
11         I do not think there is anything else.
12   MR.   BONE:   I do not think so, sir.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUA RT - SM I TH :    Do you want to bring anything else
14         out?
15   MR.   BONE:    I don't,   no.      Thank you very much.
16   LORD JUSTICE S TU A RT-SMITH:        Thank you very much indeed.        We
17         will let you have a transcript of that in due course,                  and
18          if you find there is anything wrong or you have not made
19         yourself clear, you should let me know.

RE: POLICY & PROCEDURE FOR RELEASE OF HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

Release of documentation from Hillsborough Archives

The policy of disclosure of information from the Hillsborough Archives has been in force since
13 June 1991, based on an opinion supplied by Stephen Walker, solicitor to the
South Yorkshire Police Authority. A copy of his opinion is enclosed.

The policy adopted has been in line with paragraph 4c Disclosure Selectively and
Paragraph 8a to e with slight amendments in the case of sub paragraphs b, d and e.
These amendments are:-

Sub para b   If a request is made for a copy of the statement of a person who has subsequently
             died, the statement will be released without seeking permission of the next of kin,
             or executor(s). If a request for a copy of a statement is not accompanied by
             written authorisation from the maker, South Yorkshire Police write to the maker,
             seeking their permission, before providing the copy.

Sub para d    If a request is made for audio, photographic or video material that belongs to
              South Yorkshire Police, then we will release copies. In respect for those who died
              at Hillsborough and in the interests of good taste and decency, we will not release
              photographs or video of post mortem examinations, nor will we release scenes
              from the mortuary and temporary mortuary. Nor will we release pictures of the
              dead, other than to members of their family, or to their legal representatives.




                                                The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                Superintendent Hepworth
                                                (0114 ) 296 3084
              In the case of material not belonging to South Yorkshire Police, if the request is not
              accompanied by authorisation from the copyright holder, this being the case with
              the vast majority of requests, then we will write to the copyright holder, seeking
              their permission to provide a copy.

Sub para e    Pathologists reports are dealt with under Rule 57 of the Coroner's Rules 1984, not
              as suggested here.

Requests for copies of other documentation, for example copies of the submission by interested
parties to Lord Justice Taylor's Enquiry, or a copy of the Ambulance Control Room Log, which
was also submitted to the Enquiry, are met positively. Authority is not sought from the authors,
as these documents lie in the public domain. Where requests are made for copies of documents
that were not submitted to the enquiry and those documents do not belong to
South Yorkshire Police, the view is taken that they are copyright and we write to the owner or
author, seeking their permission to provide a copy. An example of this is the individual
ambulance running logs, where permission has been sought from South Yorkshire Metropolitan
Ambulance and Paramedic Service and is awaited. Our policy is towards openness and this is
evidenced by the release, after due consideration of the request, of a copy of the Phillips Report,
together with its photographic and video appendices, to Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor to the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Release of Documentation under Rule 57, Coroner's Rules 1984

Undoubtedly the advice of Stephen Walker, in paragraph 8c of the document referred to above
led to some confusion arising, over the release of material from the mini and main inquests.
A letter from Her Majesty's Coroner dated 10 September 1997 (copy enclosed) attempted to clear
up the confusion, but resulted in a meeting between the Coroner, PC Greenway and myself on
Tuesday 16 September 1997, where I drew up what I consider to be a clear policy for the release
of documentation under Rule 57. A copy of this is also attached.

You will recall from your visit with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to the Hillsborough Archives on
24 September 1997, that there was a primary file for each of the 96 victims of the
Hillsborough Tragedy. This file contained all the documentation and exhibits presented to the
inquests and it was from this file that documentation was released. We also made you aware of
the secondary file for each body, which contained photographs and video stills that were not
presented to the inquests. Following comments made by yourselves, you will be pleased to know
that we now release copies of photographs from both files.




                                                  The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                  Superintendent Hepworth
                                                  (0114 ) 296 3084
Charges for Release of Documentation

The advice South Yorkshire Poiice received in June 1991, from the solicitor to the Police
Authority, recommended that the policy of disclosure should be supported by a policy of
charging. In addition the Coroner's Records (Fees for Copies) Rules lay down a scale of fees
which Coroner’s can charge for the provision of documentation under Rule 57.

To date South Yorkshire Police have not imposed a charge for the provision of copies of
documentation from the archives. The cost to the organisation has been and continues to be
considerable. There must come a time when charges will be levied.

Dear
HILLSBOROUGH DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION
Further to our brief conversation yesterday I enclose my opinion on the
issue of disclosure. When you have had the opportunity of digesting it
perhaps you would like the opportunity of talking through it because I
readily accept that the issue is a difficult one in the context of
Hillsborough, therefore any decision on policy can under no circumstances be
taken lightly.
Yours sincerely




Stephen Walker
Solicitor to the Authority
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

1       I am aware that a substantial number of requests have been received for
        copies of documents and other material acquired for the purposes of the
        various investigations into the Hillsborough Disaster and now in the
        possession of the South Yorkshire Police. The following purposes can be
        identified.
        1       Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s enquiry.
        2       Coronal inquests.
        3       DPP investigation.
        4       Disciplinary investigation.
2       It will be known that Council opinion has been sought on the vexed question
        of disclosure and the following principles can be drawn from this opinion.
                 As a general rule no documents or material ought to be disclosed unless
                 civil proceedings have been commenced and discovery is due to take
                 place.
                 No disclosure of documents, video films and photographs which are
                 clearly in the ownership of someone else should be disclosed by the
                 Police without the owners consent.
                 No information should be disclosed that is likely to prejudice any
                 disciplinary hearing.
                 -St.at.pments t a k e n   f o r the   s o lg purpose o f th e   s i x com plai n t s   f r o m M es srs
                                                                          These being as
                 I understand it the only complaints which have been investigated
                 separately and not subsumed in the investigation into the "main event",
                 are subject to public interest immunity and therefore must not be
                 disclosed under any circumstances.
    3   There is no legal requirement as far as I am aware at present to disclose
         any information. No request for information has been made in the course of
         civil proceedings concerning the Chief Constable where the stage of
        discovery has been reached and there are to my knowledge no relevant
         criminal proceedings.
    4   It seems       to me there are three policies which can be adopted by the Police.
            a     Disclose nothing,
            b     Disclose everything,
            c     Disclose selectively.
         The first may be seen as attractive because of the resource time which will
         be taken in finding, copying and then releasing material. However against
         this is the loss of public favour which may result from not disclosing the
         most innocuous material, say a persons own statement which has no bearing on
         any remaining issues of the disaster. Indeed I would go further and suggest
that such a policy may be misinterpreted deliberately or otherwise by the
media and others so that there is constructed a belief that the Police have
something to hide.
A policy of disclosing everything is not possible for the following reasons:
Material which is owned by someone else should not be disclosed without
their permission and in this context it may seem to be more practible to
refer the person who has requested the material to the owner. Statements
taken as part of the six complaints referred to in P a r a g r a p h e d cannot be
disclosed since they are public interest immune and it is not for the Police
to wave that immunity.
The final policy of selective disclosure appears attractive because although
it will have resource implications it does enable the Police to protect the
public image aspects of the case, particularly in the light of the Forces
most recent statement of purposes and values. But it does have a further
drawback which is the inevitable arbitration which will have to take place
and which may well lead to allegations of "cover-up" or something similar
thus negating the primary purpose for adopting the selective disclosure
policy.
One final matter which must not be lost sight of is the policy which has
been adopted in relation to requests from the Hillsborough Steering Group.
(ACC Stuart A n d er so n’s letter of 2 May refers). It has been reiterated on a
number of occasions that no request for disclosure will be considered until
after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been completed. The
reasoning is of course the possibility that disclosure may prejudice those
proceedings. Even then it has been said that applications will be dealt
with on their merits and that regard will be had to the purpose for which
the material is required. So the principle of selective disclosure has
already been articulated at least to the Hillsborough Steering Group.
A number of different classifications of document can be identified and
although the following list is not intended to be exhaustive it can be used
to develop a policy of disclosure although such a policy would not be
implemented until after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been
resolved. This of course will include court action such as Judicial Review
relating to decisions taken on those disciplinary aspects
a     Own Statements
      Apart from statements taken in connection with the six specific
      complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d there can ultimately be no
      objection in law to these being disclosed. If previous requests have
      been refused on a "for the time being" basis. There is a risk of
      criticism if these requests are not dealt with until a fresh request is
      made.
    b    Request for Copy Statements of someone other than the maker
         Again with the exception referred to at (a) there can be no objection
         in law to providing copies as long as there is a written authorisation
         from the maker of the statement. Where previous requests have been
         refused the potential criticism referred to at (a) is relevant.
    c    Request for return of ticket
         These belong to the owners and therefore there can be no objection to a
         request for disclosure from an owner.
    d    Audio, Photographic and Video Material
         In the main this material will not "belong" to South Yorkshire Police
         and under this heading the issue of Copy-right looms large. I would
         recommend that any request from someone other than the owner is
         directed to that quarter.
    e      Pathologist Reports
         These are "expert" evidence and as such any request from someone other
         than the expert should be directed to them.
9    I believe two further points are worth making. In the area of civil claim
     for compensation I know of no case where the refusal to provide statements
     or evidence of a persons presence atHillsborough is holding up the proper
     conduct of the case. Secondly any policy of disclosure should be supported
     by a policy of charging.

Dear Sir
 Hillsborough Disaster - Supply of Documentation
I have spoken with PC Greenaway recently and subsequently with Ms Addlington from
Liverpool City Council who represents the interests of many families. It may be that some
confusion has arisen on the supply of documentation and I felt it appropriate to write and
set out the position as I understand it.
In general, it might be argued that documents supplied to a Coroner by his local police
force are obtained solely for the Coroner and it therefore becomes a matter entirely in the
discretion of the Coroner as to which documents are shown to interested parties. However
the Coroner must still comply with the terms of Rule 57 of the Coroner’s Rules 1984 which
state that parties are entitled to a copy of any post-mortem report, report of a special
examination, transcript of evidence or of a statement which is read out during the inquest
by way of documentary evidence (rather similar to Section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act).
The Blair Peach case makes it plain that in the isolated cases where statements are in fact
collected for purposes other than the Coroners (eg. Police Complaints Authority, Judicial
Enquiry or submission to the DPP) that the ownership of those statements does not rest
with the Coroner. In such a case the Coroner does not have discretion about the release
of documents for they are not his to release. However, he must still fulfil his statutory
obligations under Rule 57.
 It is quite clear that the Hillsborough papers fall into the “Blair Peach category” and I do not
 regard myself as having authority to release any documentation unless it is covered by
 Rule 57. Nonetheless, South Yorkshire Police have taken the stance (correctly in my
 view) that it is appropriate to release to relatives copies of statements relevant to the
 deaths. This is an entirely separate issue to Rule 57 and the Chief Constable must
 presumably make the decision whether documents are to be released or not.
Turning to a slightly different issue, you may be aware Ms Addlington has asked that the
statements of Dr Forrest be released. This situation is fraught with difficulty for me. As
you will know, I have always made clear that prior to my appointment as Coroner in 1991 I
had some peripheral involvement in the Hillsborough disaster. In personal terms this took
the form of work for a national charity assisting relatives and others in the immediate
aftermath of the disaster. In legal terms I was subsequently involved in giving advice to a
medical defence organisation, one of whose members was Dr Forrest.
The mention of Dr Forrest’s statements this week is the first time that there has been any
suggestion of a potential conflict. If necessary I would happily step aside and let the
decision be made by another. However, a statement made by a toxicologist for the
Coroner’s proceedings (even if also used elsewhere) is the report of a special examination
as defined in Section 20(4) of the Act. Such a document is specifically referred to in Rule
57 and does not leave any issue of discretion. I do not believe that I can be accused of a
conflict of interest merely by fulfilling my statutory obligation and I have sent Mrs
Addlington a copy of the statements of Dr Forrest in response to her request.

      MEETING WITH HM CORONER CHRISTOPHER DORRIES
           ON TUESDAY 16 SEPTEMBER 1997 AT 2 PM
HELD AT THE MEDICO LEGAL CENTRE, WATERY STREET, SHEFFIELD.

PRESENT:      H M Coroner, Christopher Dorries
              PC Ken Greenway
              Supt Alan Hepworth


The meeting was arranged to discuss what items from the individual body files of the
victims of the Hillsborough Disaster should be released to their relatives or legal
representatives, provided permission of the relative was given, under Rule 57 of the
Coroners Rule 1984. The Coroner indicated that he wished PC Greenway and myself to
act on his behalf in releasing copies of the following documents, provided they had been
properly requested:-

■   Post mortem examination report.

■   Any report of a special examination.

■   Statements presented in evidence.

■   Any statements that had been referred to in the summaries orally presented to the
    Coroner in the series of mini inquests held prior to the main inquests.

■    Photographs presented at the inquests.

■   Charts and other documents put in evidence at the inquests.


In addition to the above:

■   Any notes of evidence (transcripts) of the inquest proceedings should also be provided
    if requested by a properly interested person.


The Coroner directed us not to release the summaries contained within the body files, the
sudden death report and addresses of individuals making statements.

He asked that we blank out addresses from any copies. He stated that he would write to
Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough Family Support Group, informing her of the
decision and that if she wished, she could contact witnesses through ourselves acting on
his behalf. He agreed to supply a copy of his letter.

The Coroner indicated to us that he did not wish every request to be referred to him, but if
we were in any doubt as to who was a properly interested person he would expect us to
refer that to him. We undertook to provide the Coroner with a list of all requests received.

         'T/It
Thank you for your composite letter of 15 October 1997 in which you deal with a number of
issues. In this letter I am responding specifically to paragraphs 6 and 7 of the letter, policy and
procedure for release of documents and information from the Hillsborough Archives.

At paragraph 6A - Body files and other inquest material, I think it should be made clear that
South Yorkshire Police act for and under the direction of Her Majesty's Coroner for
South Yorkshire (West) in releasing documentation from the body files and inquest material.
In addition to the short paragraph at 6A in your letter, I would add a second paragraph as
follows:-

documents released include a post mortem examination report; a report of a special examination;
statements presented in evidence; any statements referred to in the oral summaries given to a
mini or main inquest; photographs, charts or other documents put in evidence at an inquest; a
transcript of inquest proceedings.

At paragraph 6B - Non inquest material, I would like to suggest that the line "if a 'properly
interested' person asks for a post mortem report, you release it" should be deleted, as this is
dealt with under paragraph 6A; that the release of a statement by a person who has since died
should be included; that in order not to be accused of using exclusionary language, the words his
and him should be replaced by their and them; that the words in brackets i.e. (it is
'in the public domain') should appear after the words "the Taylor Inquiry", not at the end of the
line; the word "document "in the final line should be replaced by "material".

Your paragraph 6B would then read:-

B - Non-inauest material

if a person asks for their own statement - you release

            Direct Dial No:
if a person asks for someone else's statement - you release if the person who made the
statement agrees                                                  ?

if a person asks for the statement of someone who has since died - you release

if a person asks for their ticket back, you give it to them

if a person asks for a photograph or video still you will release it,except that:-

    you don't release post-mortem pictures

    you don't release pictures of the dead except to family or their legal representatives

    you only release material which belongs to the police

if a person asks for other material then

     you release it if it was submitted to the Taylor Inquiry (i.e. it        is'in the public domain')
     or it belongs to South Yorkshire Police.

     if neither of these things applies, you seek the advice of the owner of the material and
     act on it

Another point that I feel is worthy of mention in relation to the provision of material from body files
is that relatives, or more often their legal representatives, will write asking for the missing
statement o f         when the statement is not part of the body file, but the individual named is
mentioned in someone else's statement, for example a police officer may mention the names of
other officers who started work with them, or a doctor mentions the name of other doctors, or
nursing staff who were on duty at the hospital. In these cases wethen write to the individual
named, seeking their authority to release their statement. This leads todelay in the provision of
a statement, or even non provision if the person named cannot be traced or declines to authorise
the release of their statement. I believe that in part this leads to the suspicion that we are
withholding information, when this is not the case.

I trust this information will assist you in responding to the families.

Thank you for the letter which you handed to me on 8 October during]______________________

meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.



Y ou ask for a full copy o f a video film showing the temporary mortuary which was set up at

the H illsborough Football Stadium on the day o f the disaster.             The video belongs to South

Yorkshire Police and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has no power to release it to you without their

consent.



I have how ever discussed the position with them. The video (which the Judge and I have

had to see as part o f the Scrutiny) does as you say show scenes in the temporary mortuary,

with the bodies o f those who had died laid out on the floor.            The police tell us that they are

w illing to release to relatives’ fam ilies, or to others who have a proper interest, copies o f stills

from this video which show individuals who died.



But they w ill not release stills which show the bodies o f other people who died or copies o f

the video itself.            These are distressing scenes and the police take the v iew that it w ould not

be proper, and could be upsetting to the surviving relatives o f many o f those shown on the

video, to allow others to have access to these pictures o f their relatives or to m oving im ages

from the video.

RE: CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH

I refer to my letter dated 8 October and your response of 15 October 1997, which related to a
number of issues raised at our meeting of 24 September last. In this letter I am responding
specifically to paragraph 4 about the civil actions.

As I understand it, insurance cover is carried by the South Yorkshire Police Authority, not the
South Yorkshire Police, nor the Chief Constable. In April 1989 the insurers were Municipal
Mutual Insurance (MMI) and the maximum amount indemnified was £8.5 million. Since that time
MMI has gone into liquidation, but the company plus its liabilities was taken over by Zurich
Municipal Insurance and civil claims have continued to be dealt with by them. About 2 months
ago the £8.5 million indemnity limit, which includes costs as well as settlements was reached.
Current estimates of the total cost of claims already dealt with and those not yet decided is
£13.35 million. The Police Authority has therefore set aside in reserve £4.85 million to cover the
shortfall between the amount insured against and the estimated total cost.

Zurich Municipal Insurance retained 2 firms of solicitors to advise them on the civil claims,
Hammond Suddards of Bradford, who had specific responsibility for advising on the claims made
by police officers and Weightmans Solicitors, Richmond House, 1 Rumford Place, Liverpool,
L3 9QW to advise on the claims by supporters and families, as the vast majority of these were
commenced in the Liverpool Courts.

    I refer to the letter dated 13 October 1997, from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith addressed to the
    Chief Constable, Mr Wells, which has been forwarded to myself for a response.

    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith indicates that he wishes to trace all the video material obtained by
    South Yorkshire Police on the day of the Hillsborough Disaster. I enclose a copy of the video
    schedule prepared by West Midlands Police for Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry. I am told
    that together there are over 70 hours of video. The schedule details all the tapes by reference
    number and there is a brief description of the salient points as a guide to the content of each
    tape. At the time this schedule was produced all the original tapes were in the possession of
    West Midlands Police. They are now in the Hillsborough Archive here at Heeley.

    The tapes which were placed in the recorder in the police control room after the tapes reference
    TB1 and TB2 were given the reference number TB3 and TB4. Copies of these have been made
    and have been forwarded under separate cover. I know that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith asked for
    the originals, but as I discussed with you on the telephone I am loath to supply them, particularly
    through the post, as the quality of a copy degrades from that of an original. If we then had to
    supply a further copy from a copy the picture quality would be poor.

    I do not feel able to comment on the third paragraph of the letter without actually seeing the copy
    tapes that Mr Hicks provided.

    Finally in respect of the material supplied to Yorkshire Television, we have identified a "First
    Tuesday" documentary programme, which was broadcast on the ITV Network on Tuesday
    6 February 1990. The programme was made with the co-operation of West Midlands Police and
    we have a video copy of it. We are presently identifying the source of all the video clips shown in
    the programme and still enquiring as to how these came into the possession of Yorkshire
    Television. I have traced a copy of a letter from Yorkshire Television to the then Chief Constable
    of South Yorkshire Police seeking his approval for the making of the programme, but I have not
    traced the response. I will deal with the matter more fully in a separate letter, when I forward a
    copy of the programme to you together with a schedule of the video used.

o f the disaster and I am also anxious to k n o w precisely what material was supplied by the South
Yorkshire P olice to Y orkshire Television.

        I have already been provided w ith tw o tapes TB1 and TB2 together w ith a schedule o f the
contents of the tapes, w h ich I understand was provided to Lord T aylor’s Inquiry and the Coroner.
Please confirm that this is correct. TB1 finished at 15.04 and TB2 at 15.34. M r H icks, w h o has
provided m e w ith a cop y of som e o f the material said to have been provided by y o u to Yorkshire
T elevision, to ld m e that there are tapes w hich go on till 17.22. I assume that these are those w h ich
were inserted in the m onitors in the control room at about 15.34. I w ou ld be grateful if y o u w ou ld
send m e the original of these tapes (you should retain a copy).

        O n one o f the cop y tapes that M r H icks has provided to m e there are view s from cameras
other than those at fixed points around the ground, for example there are view s in to pen 6, scenes in
the m ortuary and view s from the N o r th Stand after the disaster. I believe these w ere taken by the
police underw ater team. I have seen part o f the film taken in the m ortuary w h en I came up to
Sheffield o n 24 September.

       W ou ld y o u also please be kind enough to supply m e w ith correspondence passing betw een
Y orkshire T V and South Yorkshire Police.

I refer to your letter of today in which you ask>

(a)         When you will receive a response to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's letter of
            13 October?

             An initial response was sent yesterday, together with copies of the schedule of
             video tapes. Copies of video tapes TB3 and TB4 were sent under separate cover
             yesterday.

(b)         Could you have a copy of the exhibits lists for Lord Taylor's Inquiry and the
            Inquests?

             Copies of both are enclosed herewith.

(c)         Could you have a copy of the video tape of the inquest when video C539 was
            shown to the jury?

             This will be forwarded to you with a separate letter once we have copied the tape
             which will take 4 hours.

I A NTHONY JAMES EDWARDS will say:                            I was born on



I work as an ambulance man on day work.                              I joined SYMAS in

September 1988.           I started part time and was promoted to day
                                                                      /
work    on    6th    March    1989.           I    had       previously      been        in    the

ambulance      service       in    1973       in    Liverpool        and     had        received

qualified status.            I had done further training which lead to

me    being    admitted      as     a    Fellow       of      the    Ambulance           Service

In st itute.         This     is    a     qualification              above        the    normal

standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an

introduction to it.               I left the service in 1982 and went to

Sheffield      Polytechnic         to    do       social      studies.        I worked          in

adult education until I rejoined the service.



On    Thursday      and   Friday        I worked         a   shift   of     0800       hours    to

1630 hours.



On Saturday I was to work from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.                                         I

was with                           who   is a qualified              ambulance man             and

was acting as driver.



The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when

we were taking a patient                 to the Northern General Hospital.

We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the

gym    at    Hillsborough      where      they       would      be   met     by    a    station

officer.       I thought      that       it would be some                 form of a fight

going on.       Our radio was on the day frequency which I think
is channel 3^.            We stayed on the channel all the way through

the    day.          We    did               change        to    ERC     a=te— a»y-^.»fcage. Y\



It was about          1510 to 1515 hours when we w e p                       on our way to

the    Northern           General      Hospital.            We    arrived       at     Northern

General about 5 minutes later.                          There were various messages

coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient

in the ambulance.              We took the patient into the hospital and

it was       sometime before             1530 hours when we got back                    to the

ambulance and started to clean up.                          We then gave the call to

control that we were clear.                        I made the call on channel

Control       then    told       us    to     go   to     Hillsborough          gym    entrance

where we would be met by an ambulance officer.                                    We did not

know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to

use    the    radio       to try and          find out where            the entrance was.

We went down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is

about      one     and     a   half      miles      away.         Control       then    gave    a

message to all mobiles.                      They repeated that it was                  for all

mobiles       and     said     that         they   were     to     proceed       to    the    gym

entrance      at     Hillsborough            as    they    had    notification         of    some

fatalities.          I think this was around 1530 hours.                           We arrived

at the ground at about                   1532 hours.            There were no problems

in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of

Herries      Road,        South       and    Penistone          Road.      There      were    two

ambulances in front of us and a police officer was directing

us    to   park     behind       them.        A    short    time       later,    probably no

more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.                                            I saw

        standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us

to go into it.                The police officer shouted to us that if we

went to the second entrance then we would be, able to get out

via the first entrance.                                   said no and that he wanted us

to go into the first entrance.                                 We did so.          We were met by-

Mr.Hopkins               the     Assistant                Chief        Ambulance               Officer.

Mr.Higgins          was       also    there.              Higgins      told       us     to    drive       up

behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at

the    same    time       Hopkins         told       us    to go       on    to    the    field.           At

this     stage           there       we r e     rows        of    police           with       vans        and

stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                                                     It

was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the

stretchers.          I would say the time was about 1535 hours.



We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the

corridor       to    the       pitch.           The       officer      at    the       front        of    the

ambulance      said        that      we could             not    get   through.           Spectators

were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                                          We stopped

and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                                                   I

said    that     the       police         officer          said       that    we       could        not    go

through       and    he        replied         that       he     wanted      us     on        the    pitch

immediately.             He said that there were casualties at the far

end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we

were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of

the    ground.           He    told       us    to    put       our    two    tones       on        and    go

through.            We    d id       as    we    were           told    and       went        past        the
policemen.        It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but

we certainly did not get s t u c k .                  On the pitch we saw five to

six    boards     being       used    as     stretchers          with        bodies      thereon

being carried by fans.                    We drove past th em ^w hi le they were

sc re am in g    at    us     to    stop.          The    S t . J o h n ’s    ambulance         was

leaving     the       pitch    as    we     came      through       the      entrance.           It

waited    until       we    were    out    of   the      way   before         going      off    the

pitch.      We    were      the     only     ambulance         on   the       pitch     by     this

stage.     We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west

stand.     There were people e v e r y w h e r e .             My driver was looking

for    an officer but we could                  not      find one      anywhere.             There

were    fans bashing on             the    ambulance wanting                 us   to   stop    and

help their f r i e n d s .          We were approached by a woman and she

shouted         through        the    window          and      said          that      she     had

resuscitated          a casualty.           I got     out of        the vehicle with              a

bag, mask and a i r w a y s , and went to a body whi ch w a s lying in

front of the goal             in the 18 yard area.                  Someone was giving

mouth to mouth resuscitation.                       I noticed the colour of the



been revived.          All the time there were people shouting at me

for oxygen and all             I could remember .shouting was                          "one. at a
about 1540 hours.                I looked for my driver and he had driven

over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.

We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being

followed by people carrying other bodies.                                  When I got to the

ambulance          I saw    that    someone           had     aljready opened           the       back

doors.        I asked          a police         officer       to    stay with          me    to    look

after me after             I was kicked.               We put        the young boy on the

left   hand        side     and     the     girl       on     the    right      hand        side    and

someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.

Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.

I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did

so.



When     I   turned        round     again           the    ambulance       was      packed        with

people       and    so    I asked        the police           to clear         the   ambulance.

The doors          were    closed but           I could           hear   people      kicking        the

back   doors        and wanting           attention.               In the      ambulance          there

were     now        three       bod ies ,        a     nurse,        two       policemen,           two

spectators,          my    driver       and     me.         One     of   the    spectators          was

trying       to     r ev iv e     the     you ng           boy.      The       nurse    was        from

Nottingham.          She had been a spectator who had volunteered to

help during the chaos on the pitch.                               She was using a bag and

mask correctly.             The other spectator was holding the head of

the girl.          I t     o    l    d      t    o          get going.                 put on the

lights       and horns         and drove off               the pitch.           I have no          idea

what time it was by now.                    I assume that the man on the floor

was dead.           I tended to the girl                    and showed how to do mouth
       to     mo u t h    r e s u sc it at io n    while     the       spectator         did    cardiac

       compressions.               I was    very     upset      by     this    stage.          I cannot

       remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do

       not     know      what      time    it     was.      I    remember          nothing      of        the

       journey up to the Northern General Hojspital.



9.     We    took     the       three    bodies     into casualty            and    I assisted            the

       doctor       for a few minutes.                  We then loaded trolleys back on

       to the ambulance.                 I asked the spectator nurse to come back

       with us and she agreed.                     I cannot remember any instructions

       as to what we were to do n e x t .                       We drove back down to the

       ground       and     I    could    hear     conversations         on       the    radio       to    do

       with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.



10 .   There were no problems in the approach to the ground,                                          with

       police       cars        everywhere.          This       time    we    went       through          the

       second entrance.                 There were a couple of ambulances ahead of

       us.        I also saw a West Yorkshire ambulance.                            I said to

                    that I would report to an officer to see what wanted

       to    be    done.         I went      to    an    ambulance       officer         in    the    yard

       although I do not know his name.                          He said that

       was to stay with his vehicle and that I was to help as much

       as I could.               I went back to the ambulance to tell                                      to

       stay with          his vehicle but discovered                    that he had gone.                   I

       went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid

       box.       Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.                                        He

       appeared          asthmatic        and     semi-conscious.             I    put   him     on       the
      second      a m b u l an ce .      Th e n    the    attendant             on     the    second

      ambulance,                             arrived with another casualty.                        Once

      they were       loaded,         that   ambulance         set    off   to       the    hospital.


                                                                            /
11.   I then met another officer whom I did not know.                                      He told me

      to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the

      gym.      I did not realise before this that the casualties were

      in   the    gym.      I went       into     the    gym    and met         Station       Officer

      Higgins.        He said that I was to assist priorities.                                 I then

      helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to

      priority casualties.               Each time I loaded a priority onto a

      trolley      I went      back     to   the    senior       officer        in    the    yard    to

      tell      him what     I had      done      and asked          for more        instructions.

      He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.



12.   At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared

      to   be    no   communication          system      between       the officers           at    the

      ground as the radios were not working.                           Within a short space

      of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking

      wounded.        By    this      time    I   felt    exhausted         and      explained       to

      Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.                                      He told me

      that I had to go to casualty.                      I did not want to.                   He said

      that   there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital                                      and

      said that I should go with it.



13.   I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.

      then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.
      it was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.



14.   The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at

      the    Hallamshire.         We   did    so    and we     took     ^wo    transfers    to

      King Edward Hospital.              We finished ajt King Edwards at about

      1900    and    then   control      told      us   that   we   were      finished.    We

      went back to the station,              cleaned the ambulance and went off

      shift.



15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of

      the role that the gym was the play in it.                       I did not realise

      that     the    gym   was    the       c as ualty    clear in g      ce ntre   or    the

      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.

      I was aware of the major incident plan prior to this.

I JOHN FLACK will say:               I was born on



I am a leading ambulance man and have been with SYMAS for 21

years.   I have been a leading ambulance man                              for    11 years.
                                           /
Before that I was a qualified ambulance man.                               I have worked

at Corporation Street, Batemoor and Parkway.



Thursday was       my    day   off   and on      Friday         I worked         from   1400

hours to 2200 hours.            On Saturday I was to work 1400 hours

to    2200   hours   as   well.        I have        worked       on      semi-final     day

before but have never had to visit the ground except                                    as a

spectator quite a few years ago.



M y driver was                            We were called at 1410 hours to

the                            where    an     old       man   was     having     problems

breathing.        We took him to Northern General casualty unit.

We called control to say that we were clear at about 15.05

hours.       We   were    using      channel         2    which      is    the    ordinary

emergency      channel.         We     w ere    in       a     front      line    accident

emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209.



Shortly after this we received a message that there had been

an incident at Hillsborough.                   I believe that                            was

the control officer.            No details were given except that we

were told to go Hillsborough,                  Penistone Road entrance.                   We

travelled down Herries Road which is about one and a half to

two miles with the blue light on.                        It took us no more than
three minutes to get to the junction of Penistone Road and

Herries      Road    south.           There was       chaos with        public    vehicles

and police vehicles everywhere.                       We were directed across the

junction      by     the       police      to   the   entrance     with    the     sliding
                                                                    /
gates which         I think          is the     first entrance.          There were no

problems with being directed across by the police.                                 We got

through the gate and saw Station Officer Eason                              frantically

waving to us.             I got out of the vehicle and told the driver

to    stay   with        the    vehicle.        Another      ambulance     was     already

there.       I think that this was the ambulance which had been

there    from the start.                Otherwise       I think that we were the

first ambulance to arrive on site and get into the ground.

I went up to Eason and he asked for a cot to be taken out of

his ambulance.             He said that there had been a bit of a crush

and that a young boy had been crushed and stopped breathing.

At    this    time       we     were    all     unaware      of   the    extent    of     the

situation.         We removed the cot and made our way by foot onto

the    pitch.        It       was    now     about    1515   hours.       The    game     had

stopped      and there were no players                    in sight.        There were a

few    people       on    the       pitch.      We    went   diagonally      across       the

pitch towards            the west       stand.        We did not come across any

other    ambulance men.                We reached the boy who was                 lying    in

the goal      area with a few people around him.                           A police man

was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a man was giving

cardiac compression.                  I assume that he was a doctor from the

w ay that he was talking.                    The doctor said that the boy had a

good chance of surviving.                    We then put the boy on to the cot
and    ran back across           the pitch to the             ambulance.                 While we

were    tending      to    the    child      we     could    see       people       behind        the

fence climbing on top of each other but                                at that point              the

boy    appeared      to be       the worse         casualty        and we          did    not     see
                                                                        /
anyone       else   laid    out        on    the    pitch.         I    was        really        just

concentrating on the boy rather than the crowd.



We got to our ambulance which by this time was coming down

onto   the pitch.           We opened         the doors        and          took    one of       our

cots out so that we could get the cot with the boy onto the

ambulance.          I   jumped     into       the    back     of    the       ambulance          and

started       resuscitation            and    put    an     airway          into     the    boy's

mouth.       The police officer was doing cardiac massage.                                  Eason

was    in our vehicle and he got onto the radio and informed

casualty at Northern General of the condition of the child.

We then turned the vehicle round and went back out.                                        It was

a tight       fit   to get       off    the pitch but          there were                no other

ambulances trying to get in while we were trying to get out.

I was working on the child and so I could not see what the

situation was in the yard.                    I do not know what time it was

when we got         back to Northern G e n e r a l .               The driver radioed

when    we    arrived      at    Northern          General.         We       were        still    on

channel 2 at this stage.



At Northern General I spoke to a doctor and he asked whether

there was likely to be more casualties.                            I said that it was

serious but         I could not say how many more would be coming
     up.



8.   I told the driver to clean the suction equipment as soon as

     possible so that we would be ready for off.    We were about
                                                /
     three or four minutes in the hospital and then we loaded the

     vehicle        again     and      radioed       to    say     that       we    were     clear      at

     Northern         General       and     ready     to    go     back to          the    ground       if

     required.              I was then told to switch to ERC. I was told                                to

     return to the ground at the Penistone Road entrance.                                        We had

     a   quick       trip    back        down   Herries          Road       south    and     a   police

     officer        directed      us     across      the    junction.              We went       through

     the first entrance and back into the yard.                                    There were a few

     ambulances            going up       Herries         Road    as    we were coming           down.

     There      was         still a      lot    of   confusion          at the       ground       as    we

     pulled into the yard.                  I got out and told the driver to stay

     with     the vehicle.               There were bodies              around       that    area      and

     police officers walking about.                         I spoke to an inspector and

     asked where          our casualty clearing                   point      was     and where         our

     senior officer was.                  He did not know.                  At this stage I did

     not realise that the casualty clearing point was in the gym.

     I   was       not    aware     of    any    Hillsborough               plan    prior    to       this

     e me r g e n c y .



9.   I then        saw Leading Ambulanceman                                         from

     station on foot.                 I then tried to radio through to control

     to find out the casualty clearing location but could not get

     t h r ou gh    as    there       was      interference            on    the     radio       in    the
vehicle.          At    this       point    there          were    fans       grabbing        me     and

asking me to help.                  Then a fire man came up to me and said

that    they      were       resuscitating            an    18    year      old    boy       and    were

getting       some      response.           I    went       over       to
                                                                  the boy who was
                                                                  /
nearby in the gym yard area.                         There were people lying nearby

on boards who appeared to be d e a d .                            I went over and looked

at    the     boy.           He    was   still         warm.            I   went    back           to the

ambulance and got out a cot.                               I called the driver and we

loaded the boy onto the ambulance.                               I shouted to the fireman

to see if there were any others that we could load quickly

as we needed to move the boy as soon as possible.                                        There did

not    appear      to    be       any walking         wounded          about      who    wanted          to

come with us.            As we had one stretcher case already on the

ambulance we could only take slightly injured people because

of     the    room.           It     took       us     about       2    minutes         to    get the

stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the order to the

driver       to   set off.           I did not             see a senior officer                    and    I

made    the decision              to go myself.              We were          going      up    to    the

Northern G e n e r a l .           My driver tried to radio to say that he

was    leaving         the    scene      but     I    do     not       know    whether        he     got

through       or not.             Again I was working on the patient on the

trip up       and so did not follow                   the route to the hospital.                         It

did not seem to take long.



We got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.                                                 He

said that there was no hope                          for the boy and he told us to

take him to the plaster room which was a temporary mortuary.
The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

busy at Northern General and that he wanted casualties to be

taken to       the Hallamshire.              I radioed         control      and      gave    the

all    clear.        There     was    no    problem      in    getting      through         this

time.        I was told to go back to the groundf.                          I asked where

the ca sualty clearing point was.                   There was a pause and then

I was told to go to Leppings                     Lane end.                                was at

control.        I think he was telling me where to go and I do not

think he knew where the casualty clearing point was.



We    went    down     the    main    Herries      Road       to   the    roundabout         and

then    round    onto        Leppings      Lane.      The      police     were       on    every

junction       directing       us    and we were not               held   up    at   all.      I

have no idea what time it was when we got to Leppings Lane.

There was some delay around the gates because of the amount

of people around.               It was bedlam when we parked with                           fans

and police everywhere.                There were about three ambulances in

front of us on the road.                   I saw Leading Ambulance Man

from              and asked him where the casualty clearing point

was as I thought that control had told us it w a s in Leppings

Lane.     He said that he did not know but that the vehicles in

front    were     being       loaded       and   would    be       moving      shortly.        I

tried    to    find an officer in charge but could not                               see one.

Then a police inspector came up to me and asked me to take a

young    boy     and    his    dead     father     because          the   boy     would      not

leave his       father.        The boy was not injured.                     I said that I

could not move dead bodies and as the boy was not injured he
      had no priority.



12.   The    vehicles           started      to     move       up.        This        was    about        five

      minutes after we had arrived at Leppings Lane. Then another
                                                  /
      police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

      ready for moving.                I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

      the     p a t ie nt 's     arm.        A     De r b y s h i r e    am bu l a n c e m a n     w ho    was

      separated          from his colleague and had been advanced trained

      helped        with   the     loading         of    the     cot      on     to    our    ambulance.

      There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

      not look for any more patients to take with us.                                         We managed

      to    get     out    onto       Peni stone        Road    which       took      about        three     or

      four minutes.               I was      in the back assisting                     the doctor who

      told     us    to    go    to    Hallamshire          because         he    had       worked        there

      before and understood that Northern General was quite full.



13.   I was not aware of the journey because I was helping in the

      back.          I    think       it    took    about       7       minutes       to     get    to      the

      Hallamshire.



14.   We unloaded the patient and handed him over to casualty.                                                I

      then     radioed         clear       and was      told     by      control       to    go     back     to

      Leppings Lane.              I still assumed that Leppings                             Lane was the

      casualty clearing point.                      We had a quick journey back down

      which took about 7 minutes.                        We went around to just outside

      the gate and the doctor got out to see who he could help.

      The Derbyshire ambulance man stayed with us.                                          I radioed to
    control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

    I was then directed to the Herries Road bus depot to stand

    by.      We were able to turn round and go back up Leppings Lane

    and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer Eason.

    He     told    us       to    park    in    the   driveway    to    ^he   depot.       All

    drivers remained in their vehicles and I liaised with Eason.

    We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

     sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.                               We left

     the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

     the    bus    depot.           All    South      Yorkshire    vehicles     were    then

     instructed         to go      to the Penistone Road entrance.                   We went

     right    up       to    the    side       of   the   gym   where   we    were   met    by

                                   We parked the vehicles and he then called

     us together for a briefing.                      There were probably about 20 of

     us.     He split us into groups of those on the various duties

     and those who were off duty but had been called in.                             He then

     directed us back to the station.                      We got back to the station

     at about          1800 hours,        cleaned our vehicle and completed our

     shift.



Dated the          I    ^        day of                                  1989

I refer to your letter of 23 October 1997 regarding video C539 being shown in its entirety to the
Coroner’s Inquest Jury and requesting a copy of the video tape of the Inquest on the day that it
was played. A copy of the tape is enclosed.

Video C539 was shown in its entirety to the Inquest Jury on the morning of 15 March 1991. At
the request of the Coroner the video is introduced by Police Sergeant John Killick of the West
Yorkshire Police. After the video has been shown the Coroner requested a reference number
and Superintendent Beechey of West Midlands Police gave it the number C539. Sergeant Killick
is then asked to identify the content of the video and does so incorrectly attributing it to TB1
when in fact it shows scenes from TB2 as stated in your letter.

You will note that only the bottom of the large screen on which the video C539 was shown at the
inquest at Sheffield Town Hall is visible from the camera position used to video the inquest
proceedings. It is not therefore possible to see the actual content of C539.

RESEARCH INTO THE PROVISION OF VIDEO TAPES TO YORKSHIRE TELEVISION

I refer to our discussions on 24 September 1997, my letter of 8 October and Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's letter of 13 October 1997 on the above subject. A search of the indexed material within
the Hillsborough Archives has failed to reveal any correspondence from Yorkshire Television. A
search of non-indexed material and in particular the personal file of Chief Inspector Norman
Bettison (now assistant Chief Constable West Yorkshire Police) has revealed a letter from
Yorkshire Television dated 4 July 1989 and an internal memo dated 7 July 1989 from Mr Bettison
to the Chief Constable (Copies attached).

I have not spoken to Mr Bettison, nor to Superintendent Pratt, who is now retired, but is
mentioned in Mr Bettison's memo, nor to Peter Wright the former Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire Police, all of whom may be able to recall the response given to Yorkshire Television.
The YTV letter does however, make it clear that the West Midlands Police had agreed to assist
them make a documentary into the Hillsborough Disaster and was seeking the approval of South
Yorkshire Police to copy tapes and photographs for possible use in the programme. At that time
all the original Hillsborough video tapes and photographs were in the possession of West
Midlands Police and if approval was given it would have been the originals in their possession
that were copied in order to maintain picture quality.

Inspector Michael Layton of West Midlands Police (Now Superintendent at Willenhall Police
Station, John Street, Willenhall, WV13 1PU Tel No 01922 439121) was responsible for the
management of the video and photographic evidence for Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry, the
Coroner's Inquest and the preparation of discipline files. I have spoken to Mr Layton and he
recalls West Midlands Police co-operating in the making of the documentary and feels that the
copy tapes and photographs used by Yorkshire Television must have been provided by West
Midlands Police as they were in possession of the originals, but he cannot specifically recall it.

Another serving officer that Mr Layton suggests may be able to assist is Detective Chief
Superintendent Michael Foster, who works at the Regional Crime Squ^d Office, Boumville Lane
Police Station, 341 Boumville Lane, Birmingham, B30 1QX, telephone number 0121 626 4052.
Mr Foster worked directly to ACC Mervyn Jones on the Hillsborough Enquiry and would have
been privy to policy decisions. Alternatively Mervyn Jones recently retired as Chief Constable of
Cheshire Constabulary could be contacted for his recollections, or a search of his paperwork
from the Hillsborough Enquiry presently still stored at Cheshire police Headquarters may reveal
correspondence between Yorkshire Television and West Midlands Police.

I enclose a copy for your viewing of the actual Yorkshire Television Documentary, which was
broadcast on the ITV Network on Tuesday 6 February 1990, in the "First Tuesday" series of
programmes and entitled "Disaster at Hillsborough".

PC Greenway and myself have viewed the programme and have prepared a schedule that
identifies the source of all the still photographs and video clips used in the programme. The tape
running time identified in the schedule is the actual elapsed time from the start of the enclosed
copy video tape. All the still photographs and video clips have been identified with the exception
of a 3 second clip shown at 20 minutes 12 to 15 seconds actual running time of the tape. Where
possible we have also indicated the actual time of the video clip on Saturday 15 April 1989. In
the case of the BBC Video there are nine separate tapes of their footage on the day and it would
have taken us an inordinate length of time to identify the actual tape that the clips come from and
so this has not been done. With the exception of the 3 seconds we have not been able to
identify, we can categorically state that none of the video clips or still photographs used in the
programme is new and that all of them were available to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry and the
Coroner’s Inquest.

It is also worthy of note that in her introduction to the programme the presenter, Olivia O'Leary,
says "Lord Justice Taylor allowed us to film the 9 month enquiry... We used police video footage
seen only by the enquiry team..."

I do not feel that I can take this matter any further forward without speaking to people I have
named above or without access to Mr Mervyn Jones' paper.

if you feel I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr Wright
We are writing to you at the suggestion of Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant
Chief Constable (Operations), West Midlands Police.

As you may know, Yorkshire Television is making a documentary with the
help of West Midlands Police about the inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster. We intend the programme to be shown nationally on ITV when the
final report of the judicial inquiry is published. We understand this is
likely to be some time next year.

We would welcome an opportunity.to discuss the programme with you in
general terms, if you feel such a meeting would be desirable. In addition,
there are two specific matters which we would like to raise with you now,
in the hope that you will feel able to give your approval. It is these
which Mr Jones suggested we write to you about.

1. We would like to copy for possible use - by way of additional
illustrative and explanatory material - some of the tapes and photographs
which were supplied by South Yorkshire Police to West Midlands Police for
use in the inquiry. We have discussed this with Mr Jones and he says
neither he nor Lord Justice Taylor have any objections, but Mr Jones points
out that the decision must rest with you, since the copyright is held by
South Yorkshire Police.

2. We would like to film some, of your officers presently helping West
Midlands Police locate the positions of some of the deceased. We
understand some officers are viewing tapes and giving their comments,
while others are simply giving statements. We would like to film either or
both of these activities. We fully realise the sensitivity of this, and
recognise that it would require careful handling.

On this last point, we would much appreciate a n early decision, since the
work will continue for only a few weeks more. If you feel you would liice
more details of our proposals before making a decision, we would be
pleased to come and discuss them with you.

FROM:    Chief Inspector Bettison

                                                         DATE:       7 July 1989

         SUBJECT:                 YORKSHIRE TELEVISION DOCUMENTARY

         I have contacted Superintendent Pratt who claims to have something similar
         in train with the BBC and the West Midlands Police to be produced in January
         1990, but he has no knowledge of a YTV documentary. No other 'Hillsborough
         Inquiry Team1 member is aware of such an arrangement.

         Initial thoughts:

         West Midlands appear, already, to be fully committed to assisting in the
         production of a national television documentary (see paragraph 2 of the
         attached letter).

          IF South Yorkshire Police agree to assist we could find ourselves playing
        - 'second fiddle', however . . .

         IF South Yorkshire Police decline the opportunity we may be depicted as
         the 'accused'.

         The conclusion, therefore, is that we agree to take part in the production
         of this documentary on our own terms.

         Those terms might ensure that we are presented as a caring and professional
         organisation, doggedly pursuing the facts surrounding the disaster, eg

         i)         The conspiracy theory.

         ii)        Position of bodies - Pen 3.

         iii)   . Viewing and reviewing the video   evidence todetermine    when,
                  precisely, barrier 124A failed (possibly before the opening of
                  Gate C).

         iv)        Obtaining over 800 statements   on behalfof the       WestMidlands
                    investigation team - and our attempts, from them,     to build up a
                    picture of events.

         In other words, presenting the South Yorkshire Police as active rather
         than simply a passive subject of the West Midlands enquiry.

         We should not underrate the value of our comtemporaneous film material,
         video and stills (without it the proposed documentary would consist of
         images of West Midlands detectives knocking on doors).   Perhaps this could
         be traded with great care. (See paragraph 4 of the attached letter).

         Superintendent Pratt returns to duty on Monday 10 July 1989 and will have
         a view on this matter.     I have left a copy of these documents for his
         attention.

        I am trying to trace all the video material obtained by the South Yorkshire Police o n the day
of the disaster and I am also anxious to kn ow precisely what material was supplied by the South
Yorkshire P olice to Yorkshire Television.

       I have already been provided w ith tw o tapes TB1 and TB2 together w ith a schedule of the
contents o f the tapes, w h ich I understand was provided to Lord T aylor’s Inquiry and the C oroner.
Please confirm that this is correct. TB1 finished at 15.04 and TB2 at 15.34. M r H icks, w h o has
provided m e w ith a cop y of som e o f the material said to have been provided by y o u to Yorkshire
Television, told m e that there are tapes w hich go on till 17.22. I assume that these are those w hich
were inserted in the m onitors in the control room at about 15.34. I w ou ld be grateful if y o u w ou ld
send me the original o f these tapes (you should retain a copy).

        O n one o f the cop y tapes that Mr H icks has provided to me there are view s from cameras
other than those at fixed points around the ground, for example there are view s into pen 6, scenes in
the m ortuary and view s from the N o rth Stand after the disaster. I believe these were taken b y the
police underwater team. I have seen part of the film taken in the m ortuary w h en I came up to
Sheffield on 24 September.

      W ould y o u also please be kind enough to supply m e w ith correspondence passing between
Yorkshire T V and South Yorkshire Police.

Thank you for your letter of 21 October 1997 and enclosed copy of a letter you had written to
              /vhich we had previously discussed.

As far as our policy on the release of photographs and video stills is concerned, there has been
no change of approach in what we release to relatives or their legal representatives. Any
photograph of video still that is contained within a body file is released without any form of
editing, ie they are released in the format in which they were presented to the Coroner's Inquest.
Neither have we to the best of my knowledge edited any video still showing scenes on the pitch
or the terraces. We do where it is possible edit the video stills showing scenes from the
temporary mortuary so that only one body is visible, but this is not possible on all occasions
because of the way the bodies were laid out and the angle at which the video camera was to the
bodies. I accept that there will have been occasions when we have released a still from the
mortuary video that shows a part of a second body where it was impossible to blank it out without
destroying the picture content.

As you rightly point out in your letter to           ve are continuing to supply stills from the video
to relatives or their legal representatives. We will not supply a copy of the video itself to anyone.
If we were to do so and the video became public I fear the opprobrium against the
South Yorkshire Police would be impossible to overcome.

 W e discussed the letter I was going to write to             who had asked, as a relative o f

 him on the lines w e discussed (I enclose a copy o f m y letter to him for ease o f reference).

M y letter tells          H imong other things, that the police do not release to relatives stills
from this video w hich show the bodies o f other people w ho died - that is, the bodies o f people
other than their ow n relative. I f I may say so your grounds for not doing that seem perfectly
sensible in these very difficult circumstances.

Thank you for the letter which you handed to me on 8 October during your
meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

You ask for a full copy of a video film showing the temporary mortuary which was set up at
the Hillsborough Football Stadium on the day o f the disaster. The video belongs to South
Yorkshire Police and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has no power to release it to you without their
consent.

I have however discussed the position with them. The video (which the Judge and I have
had to see as part of the Scrutiny) does as you say show scenes in the temporary mortuary,
with the bodies of those who had died laid out on the floor. The police tell us that they are
willing to release to relatives’ families, or to others who have a proper interest, copies o f stills
from this video which show individuals who died.

But they will not release stills which show the bodies of other people who died or copies of
the video itself. These are distressing scenes and the police take the view that it would not
be proper, and could be upsetting to the surviving relatives of many of those shown on the
video, to allow others to have access to these pictures of their relatives or to moving images
from the video.

That as I say is the position which the police take. We cannot require them to surrender this
or any other material to you. If you or               vould like access to a still from the video,
or to take the matter further, I would suggest that you do so with the police.

RE: RESEARCH AND AUDIT TRIAL RE COACHING OF OFFICER'S PRIOR TO GIVING
EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY

I refer to the letter dated 8 August 1997, from Ian Daines addressed to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
in which the question of coaching of officers to give evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry was
first raised and to our conversation with the Scrutiny team on 24 September 1997.

Having carried out a search through some of the non-indexed documentation in the Hillsborough
Archive I traced a number of South Yorkshire Police update bulletins two of which make specific
reference to briefing of officers to give evidence before Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry. Rather than
repeat in this letter that which I have already written I enclose a copy of my memorandum on the
subject sent to ACC Ian Daines together with copies of the two bulletins.

You will note in the final paragraph of my memorandum that I do not feel able to progress this
further without speaking to officers who were part of the Inquiry Liaison Team. Is this something
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would wish or permit me to do, or would he prefer the contact to be by
yourself or Graham Catherall, or indeed is he content with the documentation provided? If Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith does wish me to speak to the officers how would he wish the conversation to
be recorded, notes of interview, written statement, tape recorded or a combination of these?

SUBJECT:      RESEARCH AND AUDIT TRAIL RE COACHING OF OFFICERS PRIOR TO
              THEM GIVING EVIDENCE TO LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INQUIRY


A search through non-indexed documentation in the Hillsborough Archive, i.e. documentation that
was not a part of the enquiry by South Yorkshire Police or W est Midlands Police that was recorded
on the HOLMES system, has revealed copies of four update bulletins about the Hillsborough
Inquiry that were given wide circulation throughout the force. Updates I and I I are unfortunately
undated, whilst I I I bears the date 2 June 1989 and IV 30 June 1989. Updates I and I I are signed
by the then ACC Staff Services, Stuart Anderson and updates I I I and IV , by the then
Chief Constable, Peter Wright.

In relation to the abc/e, action updates I and I I I are relevant and copies are attached
hereto.     Update I, although undated, was obviously written after the Inquiry started on
Monday 15 May 1989 and prior to Monday 22 May 1989. It outlined the purpose of the Inquiry, the
setting in which it was taking place, the wide admissibility of evidence and what
South Yorkshire Police had done to gather evidence for the Inquiry.             The update listed
approximately 80 officers likely to be called to give evidence and encouraged and welcomed them
to visit Headquarters, to see the progress of the internal evidence gathering and to get a flavour of
the Public Inquiry. Officers responding to this invitation were to be shown a compilation video
lasting 2 hours; were able to pose questions about the Inquiry, the evidence to date, or about any
concerns to a member of the internal evidence gathering team; were given the opportunity to visit
the Town Hall and see the Inquiry in session.

Update I I I circulated to the force on 2 June 1989, after senior officers had given evidence to the
Inquiry, described how the Treasury Solicitors, acting as "Clerks of Court" circulate statements to
all parties to the Inquiry and this is the first indication that an officer is to be called. The update
goes on to say "relevant officers will be contacted by a member of the South Yorkshire Police
Inquiry Liaison Team and furnished with all necessary information and assistance.
(The underlining of these words is on the original memo and is not mine.)

These two documents were circulated throughout the South Yorkshire Police and indicate how
open the force was in assisting and preparing its officers to give evidence before
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, but that this assistance falls far short of coaching them to give
evidence. More detail of the process could be obtained if I were allowed to contact the two officers
who acted as liaison officers.          These are Chief Inspector Norman Bettison, now
Assistant Chief Constable, West Yorkshire Police and Detective Chief Inspector Ron Brooke, now
retired. Brief statements from these two former South Yorkshire officers would support the
2 documents I have traced, clear up the question of coaching of officers once and for all and leave
no room for ambiguity in the mind of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.
                  THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE I



You will no doubt be aware that the Inquiry into the events at
Hillsborough is now underway at the Sheffield Town Hall.  Lord
Justice Taylor is sitting together with Brian Johnson, the Chief
Constable of Lancashire, and Professor Leonard Maunder, who is a
professor of civil engineering at Newcastle University.

The purpose cf the Inquiry is net tc apportion blame for the
disaster but, rather, tc discover seme of the multiplicity of
causes and make recommendations tc try to prevent something similar
happening again.   Whilst the cax panelled Chamber and the formal
lir.e cf questioning from barristers gives the appearance cf Crcwn
Ccurt,the tencr cf the proceedings is very different.   There is no
cath; witnesses sit down tc give their evidence, future witnesses
can sit"in the Chamber whilst ethers are giving evidence; hearsay
evidence and opinion are perfectly admissible.

The Inquiry is hearing evidence from witnesses in certain
categories.  The 'batting order' is as follows:

     Liverpool supporters

     Local residents/shop keepers

     South Yorkshire Police

     Hillsborough Ground Staff

     Ambulance/Fire Service personnel

     Football Association

     Technical Evidence of the state of the ground

You'should be aware that the evidence to date has been almost
exclusively from Liverpool supporters, some of whom have lost
relatives in the disaster.   It is understandable therefore that a)
less than comprehensive" picture of events has emerged.in the media.
The newspapers and television have reported individual and
sometimes sensational accounts, which do not represent the whole
evidence that has been given, not to m e n t i o n that which ha? yet to
be adduced.  Do not be disheartened by the reports which are        —
emerging, they are merely a small part of the jigsaw.

In very simplistic terms, the body of the evidence to date has-;"./;
thrown up two very .general questions which the police witnesses
will be expected to answer:
                     ••
                                                                           (2)




    (1) Did we do everything we could to prevent. i _ h e
        situation arising outside Leppings Lane turn­
        stiles, that did arise between 2.30 and 2.55pm?

    (2) Did we react as quickly as we could to the prob­
        lems that occurred in the central pens shortly
        before kick off?

We must   always remember that it is easy, in hindsight, to suggest
that we   could have done mere, or done things more auickly but GIVEN
ALL THE   CIRCUMSTANCES AT THAT TIME could we have acne more, or
done it   more quickly?

During the last three weeks evidence has been gathered, cn behalf
cf the Chief Ccnst-bie, from members cf the South Yorkshire Felice
and from members cf the Special Constabulary - many cf you will
have already provided statements.   This evidence has been distilled
 knd a report prepared for Counsel representing the South Yorkshire
 "olice at the Inquiry.  The process of collating all the evidence
has necessarily been brisk and some individuals may have harboured
seme uncertainties about the purpose of the internal enquiry, and
may new feel a little uninformed about its progress - hence this
update.

The report that is with Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police,
Mr. William Woodward Q C , paints the overall picture of our policing
the match at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.     It contains an over­
view of the Force; a description of the Stadium; a review of all
the legislation concerning the policing of football; details of
the planning of this particular match and matches in general; an
examination of the quality of communications that existed on the
day and, finally; a summary of the events that occurred, drawn
from officers' statements.    It is this picture that we hope to
present when given the opportunity to put our case to the Inquiry.

Police evidence will be called from Wednesday 24 May 1989, beginning
 l i t h those senior officers responsible for planning and controlling
 .he policing operation.     Following-on from that, individual officers
will be called to give their account of a particular part of the
events in which they were involved.      Over 1,100 officers performed
duty at Hillsborough, it-should be obvious that only a relative
few of that number .will be called to give evidence t o - t h e ,           .    vv'-
If you are called it does not imply that you have anything to answer
for and, conversely, if you are not called it does not mean that
your efforts are unrecognised.                                     —-

Solicitors for the Inquiry (who are sort of clerks to the court)
are responsible for sifting through all the evidence and choosing
those who might have  something to add to the facts already heard
by the Inquiry.  It is anticipated that something in the order
of 50-75 police officers will be called so, clearly, not everyone
will have the opportunity to tell his or her story.
                                                                                 (3)




  At the conclusion of the Inquiry, however, Counsel for the South
  Yorkshire Police can call additional witnesses if we feel that
  the whole story has not been presented or that the Inquiry has
  been misled in any way.
        t-                               *
  Attached to this report is a list of officers who', for one reason
  or another, may be people that the Inquiry would wish to hear from.
  That is not to say that they will be called, we simply do not
  know, but their particular evidence was considered useful in preparing
  the report for our Counsel.

  Each of these officers is encouraged and welcome, to see the pro-
  cress cf the internal evidence gathering to date ar.d tc get a
  flavour cf the Public Inquiry.

    At 5.00 am each morning Monday to Friday 22 - 26 May 1989, there
   will be a video shown at the Lecture Theatre,First Floor,            Force
^ H e a d c u a r t e r s . The video is a compilation of numerous films taken
4Pby the BBC, the South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club.           It lasts for approximately 2 hours and is the
    ’official' video of the Inquiry.           (There are many, many,hours of
    video film available from different sources but this two hours
    is thought to represent the most relevant).           A member of the internal
    evidence gatherincr team will be on hand to answer any questions
    you might ""have about the Inquiry, the evidence to date or about
    any other concerns.           After viewing the video there will also be
    an opportunity to visit the Town Hall to see the Inquiry in session.

  If any officers are subsequently called who do not appear on the
  list attached, then they will be provided with similar opportunities
  prior to attending the Inquiry.  At the moment we are given less
  than 24 hours notice of the calling of witnesses, so officers should
  be prepared to attend the Inquiry at that kind of notice.

   Would Divisional /Departmental Commanders please cause an individual
   copy of this report to be handed to each of the named officers
^ b y Monday 22 May 1989, and arrange for the bulletin to be brought
W t o the notice of other members of the force, who were involved at
    Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989,at the earliest opportunity-
                                                                         (4)


Please also elect a member within the Division/Department who will
arrange for all th6 named officers to attend one of the
presentations at Headquarters in the forthcoming week.  It would be
appreciated if details of those officers attending could be
communicated to Chief Inspector Bettison by telephone, Headquarters
extension 3457 between 5.30 pm and 6.30 pm any evening.


If any officer feels certain that he or she is likelv to be called
bv the Inquiry for some reason but dees not appear cn the list, then
they should contact Chief Inspector Eettisor. personally between the
above 'tin~.es. It is repeated, however, that despite being very
involved in the incident, you are unlikely tc be called unless you
have something unique to say.

                wish to avail therr.selves cf the opportunity tc view
the said video and ask questions about the Inquiry, the evidence or
the South Yorkshire Police case, then they are invited to telephone
                       cn Keaccuarters extension 3470.    If there is
 ufficient demand then this facility will be made available during
the weekend 27-28 May 1989.  Please note that attendance at that
presentation will be in the officer's own time unless expressly
approved by the officer's individual Divisional/Departmental
Commander.  This presentation would be for officers' information and
interest only and would not serve the needs of the Inquiry.

As the picture unfolds before the Inquiry a subsequent update for
the Force will be prepared and distributed.  You should feel free to
contact the Inquiry Liaison Team on Headquarters extension 3457 if
you have any concerns whatsoever (albeit it is a very busy time for
the team at the moment).

No one at this time should feel that their individual actions on the
15 April 1989 are being critically scrutinized by either the Inquiry
or the internal evidence gathering team.

The South Yorkshire Police, as a. whole, will subsequently be
represented by those individuals called to give evidence but they
are supported in that individual responsibility by the whole Eorce.
The experiences of HiJ-lsborough were, and continue to be, shared by
every South Yorkshire Police officer, Special Constable and civilian
                                                                     V■ ’

THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UPDATE III




The Inquiry is about to complete its third week and the South Yorkshire Police
have been giving evidence for eight days now.    The police witnesses to date
have been those senior officers who had, for the nose part, an overview of the
full sequence of even's   that occurred ac Hillsborough or. IS April 1955 , or
chose who took cricical   decisions during thac afternoon.    It is fair co say
that their evidence has   beer, scrutinised in great detail ar.i vigorously cross-
examined.  Ic is anticipated, however, chat future witnesses will net be
challenged to the same degree.    These officers still to give evidence simply
have a piece to add to the emerging jigsaw.

Ic is difficult to determine who will and who will not be called co give
evidence.  The list cf officers which was appended to Update I, and circulated
22 May 1SSS, remains the "best guess" in terms cf likely witnesses, although
seme Constables in those serials represented by Sergeants on the list will also
be called by the Inquiry.  The procedure of calling is as follows:

Treasury Solicitors (who act as "Clerks of Court") have now considered many
statements made by South Yorkshire Police officers.  Daily they distribute
copies of several such statements to all parties represented at the Inquiry -
that is the first indication that an officer is "on notice" for future calling.
As soon as that first indication is given then the relevant officers will be
contacted by a member of the South Yorkshire Police Inquiry Liaison Team and
furnished with all necessary information and assistance.

Subsequently we are warned, sometimes with only 18 hours notice, that an
officer is likely to be called on a particular day. Obviously the officer will
be notified of this fact as soon as possible and, at this time, arrangements
will be made for transport to and from the Inquiry by staff car.

I hope that these arrangements are clear, but if any officer has a query or
perceived difficulty then he or she is invited to contact the Liaison Team at
Force Headquarters, extension 3457. ^




The evidence thus far presented to the Inquiry has been extensive in both
quantity and scope.  Each day the Inquiry generates a transcript of evidence
which runs, on average, to 130 pages.  Confronted by this volume of material
the media have clearly been overwhelmed.  They are unable to report everything
and, sadly, have often opted for the simple and sensational.  For example,
"Liverpool goalkeeper saved my life" has been the sort of headline preferred fey
certain news editors to the 101 other headlines that may have been run as a
result of a particular days evidence.

Whilst it is a fact that the Inquiry is not being conducted by the
thus any headlines should be treated accordingly, it is proper to
just one newspaper item that accurately records a part of the evi
                                     - 2 -




12 of the Inquiry.  This item, taken from the "Sheffield Star" dated 1 June
1989, is attached for the information of all officers: the sentiments expressed
in this particular article have been echoed by other senior officers who have
given evidence to the Inquiry.  The sentiments are precisely those with which I
would wish to be associated.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL HELD BY MERVYN JONES,
FORMERLY ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE,
LATTERLY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY


Mervyn Jones, as Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police headed the police
enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, on behalf of his Chief Constable and for
Lord Justice Taylor.

Mr Jones retired from the Police Service on 31 August 1997. I have subsequently learned that
when Mr Jones concluded his investigation in the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1991, he kept certain
documentation relevant to the Inquiry, for reference purposes and in the event that he needed to
consult them, subsequent to the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, he kept personal
notes which he intends to retain.

It is my understanding that there are no original documents in the material, which is stored in a
room 11 feet square at Cheshire Police Headquarters and covers two walls of that room, merely
duplicates of certain parts of the enquiry that were passed to South Yorkshire Police at the end of
the Inquiry. (Please see attached letter dated 25 July 1997, from Mervyn Jones, Chief Constable
of Cheshire Constabulary, to Richard Wells, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.)

It was felt that the material should not be destroyed and I have now arranged with the
 Cheshire Constabulary that they will box up the material and index the content of each box.
It would then be my intention to transport the material from Cheshire to South Yorkshire and
place it in the Hillsborough Archive, unless Lord Justice Stuart-Smith should direct otherwise.

I would be pleased if you could inform Lord Justice Stuart-Smith of the existence of the material
and seek his agreement to the course of action proposed above. I would of course keep the
material in its original state, until the Hillsborough Scrutiny Team has been able to inspect it.

HILLSBOROUGH

You will no doubt be aware that I retire at the end o f August. When I concluded my investigation ii
the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1991 I kept copies o f certain documentation relevant to the Inquiry.
These were kept for reference should I have to refer to them subsequent to the conclusion o f the
investigation. In addition, I kept my personal notes which I intend to retain. However, the question
whether the South Yorkshire Police wish to receive the duplicate material which I presently hold.
There are no original documents, merely duplicates of certain parts that were passed to you by
Detective Chief Superintendent Foster at the end o f the Inquiry.

The question again, therefore, is would this duplicate material be o f any assistance to you? If not I
will make arrangements for it to be confidentially destroyed.

With best wishes




                                                                                                                                   .   •

Continuation of statement of ...........................................................................................................................................
 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverpool
 and Nottingham Forest, and commenced myduties at 10.00 a.m. that date.
 At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstileswere open I switched^ all video
  recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground via.
  the turnstiles.
  During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m. I noticed
  that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the tumstiles.                                                                                    I am npt
  sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be between 25,000 and 30,000.
  At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers the
  Penistone Road area andnoticed that there were very fewpepple in the streets,
  and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus, and when each area
  of the ground gets near to capacity the totals .start topulsate, the total
  capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which.told me.that nearly
  all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was near to .full,
  capacity.                                           ........................... ..................
    I then switched to the camera that was covering the leppings Lane end of the
    ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that .area.
    I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance, right.back
    into Leppings Lane,                        fu lly       blocking the road.                          I would estimate that there
  would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.                                                    I made a check of the computer and
    saw that the figures for the                                  W est       Stand were pulsating and showing near to
  capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of 7,000,, ,,,
  which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at a point ready
    to start pulsating.                          The figures on the computer start to pulsate when the
  capacities get to within 15% of the total...............................
    It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get .in,.that
    there would not be sufficient room for all to be acconmodated. As. I looked
  at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at the back.of.
    the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.....
    Frcm that point I could also see Police Officers trying to.get the crowd,
    into some sort of order but they were being pushed to .one.side out of the.way.
    I saw several missiles being thrown towards, the Police.                                                                    A large, contingent,
  of the fans were climbing onto the .backs.of others and climbing, the .walls
  over the top of the turnstiles;                                          they were lading onto the asbestos .roofs. .

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.
 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stand.
 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent
 MARSHALL requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors
 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident
 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.
 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of
 Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the
 ground.     Within a minute of this happening I noticed that the large doors
 of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans run into
 the ground.       I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in
 that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and
 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
 I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area
 of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of
 hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of
 the ground.
 I could see that all available officers were .being sent to this area of the
 ground to assist with the injixred and dying.
 By this tine injured persons were being brought to the Players' Entrance area
 of the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging
 for ambulpices to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to hospital.
 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police
 personal radios were working very well, but during the day there appeared to
 be sane distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.
 I would only like to add that in myppinipn that the main cause of thismajor
 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the natch too late and
 being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground without
 tickets.      It was obvious that looking at the crowd putside the ground prior
 to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to enter with­
 out tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside
 the ground.

HAROLD GUEST




Police Constable 1421




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.   If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance,

On a ticket match this roll? be'comes a watching brief with the main

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock         .

,a«rf^and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.                                   .          .          .

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras:. \ ..

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95                 : ‘

turnstiles.    There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a       ..    ; ....

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main. .                 .

Police control point situated between the West and South Stands. There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.              The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

3 0 ,0 0 0 .

At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in“ tQ p

streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 p l u s W h e n

each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

near to full capacity.

I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.   I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.   I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,   The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.   From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles , and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.

At feteie -point I tried to use my personal radio in   order to   contactPolice
              A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.    At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

he is the person who   installed all the videos andcomputer       system.

As he could alsosee    what was taking place he also left the room in order

to assist in any way he could.

I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

hospital.

I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground

without tickets.     It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the    back to back radio system owned by the club,as I knew

Mr Lock would deal    with any situation that had developed.

After the incident    I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows :-

Spion Kop                              19,906

North Stand                                8,109

South Stand Covered                        4,740

South Stand Uncovered                      3,255

West Stand                                 5,618

                   TOTAL               48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means.

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.    I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.



At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at

point ready to start pulsating.    The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
in that   th e re   would not be sufficient room for all to be

accommodated.       As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.        From that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into sane

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.         A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;           they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jumping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.



On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.



During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

further 15 minutes.



At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

side of Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

fans run into the ground.        Within a minute of this happening I

noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane

open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.        I could tell

from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area that the
Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.



I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.



By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players'

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.



I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be sane distortion, and sane messages could not

be read cleanly.



I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of

this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

to enter the ground without tickets.    It was obvious that looking

at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

thousands that were attempting to enter without tickets at all cost

to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.

HAROLD GUEST



Police Constable 1421



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.   If there are to inform control to arrange

 for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

 are not known in advance.

 On a ticket match this rolC be'comes a watching brief with the main

 concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

 The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

 Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

 problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

     and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

 to the control room.

 In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

 which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

 switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.                    There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.                     The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

 via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

 I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

 3 0 ,0 0 0 .

 At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in tl
                                                       *V f (tis   S ^ o -e y J         .   1---------

 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus .A When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity.

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
                                    -   3   -




area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.      I would estimate

that there would be between 3»000 and 5»000 fans.      I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,       The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

 get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

 side out of the way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

 Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

 top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

 inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

 the West Stand.

 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

 Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

 At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

 Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

 the ground.   I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

 in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

  appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.


                                                                               (
I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.                                            (
                «w »        to to*o ,e « w c, C*<xM   40^   sh h*   ______
At feki-e point I tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
              A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.   At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

 Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

 he is the person who installed all the videos and computer system.

 As he could also see what was taking place he also left the room in order

 to assist in any way he could.

 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

 the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

 By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

 the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

 hospital.

 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

 personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

 to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

 I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

 and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground



                                                                             (
without tickets.    It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club, asI knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that had entered   the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows :-

Spion Kop                           19,906

North Stand                          8,109

South Stand Covered                  4,740

 South Stand Uncovered                3,255

 Leppings Lane                       7,038

 West Stand                           5>6l8

                   TOTAL             48,666

 These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

 entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

 entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

I,    DOUGLAS       JOHN LOCK, of
                              WILL STATE:-


My    date of birth is                                     I am presently Chief of
Security         with    Sheffield        Wednesday Football         Club         at    their
ground      at     Hillsborough.            My   employment .in ..that             post . is .
part-time         and my main duties are on match days, but I„work on
a    part-time basis through,.the whole.year - not just                           confined .
to the football season,


My main career was in the Police Force for_some 30 years until;
I     retired      on     28 th     February,      1985,    At
retirement         I    had       the. rank of Superintendent, in             the       South.

although ultimately, it. did not succeed  in that year
During     that        spell       Inspector Clive Calvert        was       my     Liaison
Officer        and     he       and I had a good deal of         contact         with     the
Sheffield       Wednesday           Club.   Such liaison waB        mainly with the
Secretary       of the Club - in the early stages Eric England                            and
latterly        Dick        Chester - and each game that the            Club           played
throughout           the     season w*s categorised according to the                     Gate
which     we    would           expect, not least dependent        on the          kind     of
following       that the visiting team would have.                  As X recall the
games     were categorised as A, B or C.                  A category C game would
involve        crowds        of up to say 20,000 people; category B up                      to
30,000 people? and category A where yet larger crowds would be
expected.            There would be meetings with the Club prior-to the
start          of the football season proper, when the fixtures                         would
be     known,        and the categories for each game would be                     agreed.
Each     category involved a consequent minimum level of policing
and     since the Club have to contribute to the cost of policing
they     have        a financial interest in the matter.                I    would         say
however        that        in    my dealings with Sheffield         Wednesday             they
have     always        been        prepared to accept the level             of     policing
which     we thought proper and not tried to influence us to keep
the     numbers        of        Police Officers down for        cost       reasons.            I
should         also        add     that   even   though    the    games          would         be
categorised           at        the start of the season if, for             any        reason,;
during     the        season things changed - e.g. if one o£ the                         Clubs
involved        had a successful run so that a larger crowd ictight be
expected - we could and did re-categorise matches.


Other     factors           were also involved of course in the "level
policing we might require.                  We would typically liaise with the
Police     Force           for     the visiting Clubs'' home       town          for     added
intelligence from them                as to the fans that might''be-eXp^dted^


About     2 weeks prior to each game Inspector Calvert and I would
have     meetings           with the Chief Superintendent and               the        Deputy
Chief          Superintendent to discuss the policing for the                          forth­
coming     match,           and then having established the contingent                     of
Officers        required we would go to the Football Liaison                            Offi
at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters at Snig Hill, Sheffield
to     arrange       extra manpower from other Divisions -                   e.g.         from
Road     Traffic Division, Mounted Police, and (where                        necessary)
Dog     Handlers.           Within a week of the match we would                normally
have     confirmation of the extra manpower available to us,                               and
then     Clive        Calvert and I would discuss the whole matter                        and
draw     up    an operational plan to be put into operation on                             the
day     of    the match.           This operational plan would           include,           in
particular,           deployment of Police Officers within and                  outside
the Ground.


Our     policy was to use Officers from F Division in those areas
where        there was likely to be pressure or problems because                            of
their        familiarity with the Hillsborough area.                   Thus we always
tended        to     use the same group of Officers for duties                      on     the
pitch,        not least because if trouble were to arise their faces
would        be well recognised by regular fans who would perhaps be
more     ready        to     approach them and report           matters.        Officers
would        also be deployed on duty for off-loading coach loads of
visiting            fans      and     escorting   them     to    the    Ground            from
particular           areas, and likewise in relation to special trains.
When     large        crowds        of visiting fans were expected             we        would
control        their        arrival    by   close liaison       with     the        Traffic
Division,           who would direct traffic along a particular                      route?
coaches        coming        off    the Ml would, for example, be              asked        to
exit     at a Junction at Tankersley where there is a very                               large
lay-by        and     they would be stopped in that lay-by and Ians                         on
board        would     have        tickets checked.      Care would     be     taken        to
co-ordinate           the     arrival of coaches and trains so               that,         for
example,           if a train-load of fans was e x pec ted th e .arrival
a     group of coaches might be delayed until those fans                        arrivinf
on     the     train had been escorted to the               Ground.          Furthermore-
coaches        were always directed to offload in                a   particular          areaf
then     to follow a particular route around the Ground and                               park
in      Cole        Road. After the match all visiting fans would                         then
be     escorted from the Ground back via Cole Road to the coacheS
or trains, as the case may be.
When     theoperational plans were drawn up                copies would go        to
each     particular             group of Officers - i.e.Traffic      Division,
Mounted Police, etc. and they would detail the duties for each
particular section of men.                 A copy of the operational plan was
always     given to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club in advance of the match.


On     Match Day, before kick-off, I would brief all the Officers
on     duty.        Those        briefings normally took     place   within       the
Ground,        either          in the vicinity of the Police Room or in           the
gymnasium depending on how many Officers were involved.                         After
a     general briefing to all, the Inspectors and Sergeants would
then     be separately briefed in more detail, but all                   briefings
essentially broke down the operation into 3 phases:-


 1.      The period up to kick-off }
 2.      The       period from kick-off until 10 minutes before the end
        of the match;
 3      pv-om 10 minutes before the end to dispersal of crowds.


 During     my      3     seasons     in   charge we never    had    a   F.A.     Cup
 semi-final         played at Hillsborough and to my recollection                 the
 largest       crowd          we. had was one of about 48/000 people       fo£     an
 evening       match with a 7.30 p.m. kick-off.              On that occasion          I
 recall that the                crowd of fans arriving was suchthat it became
 obvious that we                could not get everyone into the Ground in time
 for kick-off.                When that was reported to me by my Officers, we
 approached             the     Club Secretary - I believe it was
 Chester       -    and asked him whether the start of the match                couid
 be     delayed          so      that all the fans could be brought      into     th«
 ground.           We     received prompt agreement to that          request,     the
 start     was      put back for 15 minutes and we announced this                over
 thfi    p. a # system to this czrowd*          Th&t I’Glicvcd tiis.
 in fact by 7.35 p.m. or thereabouts all the fans were in.

Because       of my experience of and interest in policing football
crowds,       following         my     retirement from the Force                 I    wrote         a
series       of    3    articles for a local newspaper,                    the       Sheffield
Telegraph,         on        this    topic.         Subsequently I         did       appear        on
television on a couple of occasions in discussions on football
and    the football supporters' hooliganism problems and X wrote
some articles for the Police Review.


It     was    after the tragedy at the Heysel football                           stadium           in
Belgium       that I recall I was contacted by Superintendent                                 John
Freeman       of the South Yorkshire Police who told me that he waB
calling       at       the request of Dick Chester to enquire whether                               I
might        be interested to join Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
 as    their       Security Officer.                Having retired from the Force                    I
 was     not working at that time, and X went to see Dick                               Chester
 and        following           a    discussion          with    him   I    accepted               the

 appointment.

 In    my     post as Chief of Security I was involved with                              general
 matters of crowd safety and I was of course familiar with the
 Green Code,  the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, and the
 recommendations of the Pcpplew.ll Inquiry. I therefore had
 these matters very much in mind in performing my task as
 Security Officer. . One of the early things that I did after my
 appointment            was to check all the gates around the stadium and
 to     change the padlocks on those gates to a common padlock                                      so         r
 that every gate could be opened with the same key.                                   The folipe
 were "supplied
            lea with 2 —
                wiuu * of those keys - I gave
                                         J    them to- Inspect^; y
 Calvert - so that they could copy as many as they wxsae .
  also       provided keys to each of the stewards within the                             Ground             ^ .

  Who were manning gates.

  I also          checked in relation to fire precautions and I
  that a          number of alarms and extinguishers were not -
  accessible            on     match    day - the position was               that
  Brigade          would       inspect        the       Ground   without     a
  present,         and during matches certain gates may be

                                                                                              v;
would     otherwise               be     open    or other changes             made       which        the
Brigade       apparently               had not realised.          I arranged             for     those
matters to be put right.


All     matters          relating          to the erection of            perimeter             fences,
gates     in     the       fences, the siting of crash                    barriers             in      the
standing        areas etc.               were, I believe, dealt with between                           the
Club     and     the       Committee            set    up    by   the     Local          Authority,
pursuant        to       the        Safety of Sports Grounds Act.                    I    know         for
example        that       up        to 1985 the central pen at the                   west           stand
(Leppings        Lane)             end was not divided by the fence                      which'        now
runs     from        the          centre of the mouth of the tunnel                      under         the
stand,       down        to        the    perimeter fence.            There      was        a       crush
barrier        about          12' in from the mouth of the tunnel                          entrance,
and     my     recollection               is that the positioning of                     that        crush
barrier        relatively close to the entrance from the tunnel                                        was
capable        of     causing            a build-up of fans at the mouth                        of      the
tunnel         and       it        was    often       necessary     to        deploy       a     Police
 Constable          on     either          side of the tunnel            to     ensure          orderly
 dispersal          of the crowd within the pen.                    Subsequently                however
 that        crush       barrier          was     removed     and     the       fence          erected,
 presumably at the request of the Safety Committee.


 The     gates in the perimeter fence are.                        closed, but not locked,
 during        matches            so     far    as I am aware.           The     gates          are       so
 designed        that         the latch cannot be easily opened from                             inside
 the     pen, and the position is that the gates would normally be
 manned        outside            by stewards and Police Officers.                        The        gates
 opened        outwards on to the pitch area, and to open them it was
 merely        necessary to press down on the spring-loaded latch                                         to
 release        it.           I     do    recall      that    after      my     appointment                   as
 Security        Officer               I was a little concerned that some                       of       the
 advertising             boards          on     the perimeter of the            pitch          extended
 partly        across             the mouth of those gates a n d x o u l d ;:::create^;i»:
 obstruction             and I arranged for the boards to be moved or,
 necessary           reduced in length, to prevent any possibility
 obstruction arising.
                                                                                                     ■'.. /
I        also took steps to upgrade the Public Address System at the
Ground        and       indeed last year the P.A. System            was      completely
replaced          with        a     new, more powerful, system.         Part      of     the
reason        for       this        was that I was conscious of        the     fact      the
P.A. System             was an essential part of the emergency evacuation
procedures             at the Club.          Standing rules provided for a             coded
message           to    be announced over the P.A. and this                announcement
would        be        an indication to Police Officers and Stewards                    that
emergency              evacuation procedures were in force.             The      Stewards
were        then        required to take up positions at their                exits      and
gates,        and        to       open    those gates.   I   made   sure      that      this
evacuation              procedure was tested on match days to be satisfied
that        it would work efficiently in the event of an evacuation.
Indeed        in the 1988/89 season which is just drawing to a close
we        have had 2 emergency evacuation tests in which the                         Police
were also involved.                      Their part was co-ordinated via Inspector
Sewell        and        on the occasion of these tests the coded                 message
would        be broadcast and then we would check quickly round                          the
Ground        to see that all the gates had in fact been thrown open
and were manned by Stewards.


Following the Popplewell report the proper training of fit and
able        Stewards          was        a recommendation.   In fact    many      of     the
Stewards           at     Football Grounds are older men who               may    perhaps
have        retired or be approaching retirement from their                       regular
work        so     that it is not always possible to have Stewards                       Who
are        fully        fit from.the point of view of youth             and      fitness.
Where        possible, however, younger candidates were recruited as
Stewards           and        I    did take steps to ensure that        training         was
available              to them.          Thus, at the beginning of the season, for
the        last 3 seasons, I have had 2 training evenings                        organised
at        the Club.           The first evening is for gatemen, catering
 ground          staff, and the second evening concentrates on traihiitg
    of    Stewards.               On both evenings there are demonstrations              ahd
    instructions          given          on first aid? there is a talk by          Station
 Officer          Miles           of the local Fire Brigade re fire          precautions
and     fire duties; there is a talk by a                                                     Police   Inspector        (this
year     Inspector Sewell) on emergency procedures; and finally I
talk to them about Ground Regulations and we finish off with a
video     of the Bradford and Heysel disasters in the context                                                                of
stewarding           of        soccer             grounds,                        a video            produced    by      the

Metropolitan Police.


in     addition the Stewards are given written instructions as to
their        duties       on    match days.                               Initially these                 were     printed
sheets        given to them at the beginning of each season,-but                                                             of
late I have altered the system slightly so that each match day
emoloyee is provided with a booklet at the commencement of the
 season,       which           he has to sign for. This booklet                                               contains          a
 separate          sheet       for    e   a   c   h   h   o   m   e       match, which can be used                      as      a
 signed       receipt for payment of wages for match day duties.                                                             In
 the back of the booklet are printed the instructions for match

 dav staff»

 I also c w s e d to be produced a Management Information Sheet on
 »Dse        and    Training          of stewards" which was given to                                              all       the
 administrative                 staff at the Club, to ensure that                                               there        was
 Management           awareness               among all of them of the functions                                             and
 duties of Stewards and part-time staff.


  Finally,          on the match day itself, Stewards are briefed by the
  Police,          usually in groups for each of the 4 separate areas of
  the Ground - north, south, east and west.

  superintendent               Brian          Mole.                   M   r   .   M   o   l   e   took over these       duties
  very       shortly        after I retired, following the death                                                   of     Chief
     Superintendent Brian Moseley.                                        Mr. Mole was one of those Chief
     Superintendents who took a very active or hands-on approach
     being     in     charge         of policing Hillsborough and I                                             had      work,
     fairlv closely with him in my position as chief of Security c
     the Ground up to the point where he was transferred to anoth.

Division        in    about March of this year.              During his      spell           in
P Division           he had been in charge of 2 F.A. Cup semi-finals at
Hillsborough           -     Coventry City v. Leeds United and in                1987/88
Season,        Liverpool v. Notts. Forest.             Inspector Clive           Calvert
had     worked        as     his Liaison Officer up to and          including            the
1987/88        F.A.        Cup semi-final but he was then transferred                    and
his replacement was Inspector Sewell.


When     Brian        Mole     was    transferred from        F   Division       he      was
replaced        by Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Super­
intendent          Duckenfield's        first match at Hillsborough— was                     on
Saturday,            1st     April,    1989    when    the    visiting     team         were
Millwall        F.C.        and   the crowd was relatively small             and        well
behaved.


The     Club       was involved in an evening match on Wednesday,                         5th
April,        against        Wimbledon F.C. and again on that              occasion            I
met       Chief       Superintendent          Duckenfield     and   also        Inspector
Sewell.        After         that match had started, at about 7.45 p.m.                      we
pulled        in     all the Chief Stewards into a meeting                 to     discuss
with      them       the      arrangements for the       forthcoming         semi-final
between        Liverpool          and Notts. Forest.         In addition to            the     4
Chief      Stewards           also    present were                   |(who       keeps         a
running         check        on turnstiles on match days and          arranges               for
change          to      be     available      etc.),                            (who          is
 responsible          for payment of Stewards)                               and
                   We discussed with them what extra Stewards we                        wOftld
 require        for        the semi-final, for their differing sections                       of o'-\ ':■•
 the    Ground, and we needed to have details of numbers etc
 that     special           passes could be organised for those
 Stewards.           Because each Chief Steward knows his own area
 and     we knew we would have a capacity crowd for the semi-^f;
 their        views were very much listened to and heeded^'-in
                                                            rrr--*—                .



 what extra stewarding was required.


 On     the     day of the Cup semi-final I arrived at the Gr
 approximately 9.45 a.m. and parked my car at the Le
end of Fielding Road.                                I entered the Ground, and carried out a
general          tour                  of       inspection around the whole Ground             in     the
period up to about 10.45 a.m.                                  I recall that Roger Houldsworth
was        at    the Ground and indeed I assisted him by                                footing       the
ladder           for him whilst he was carrying out some repairs to one
of     the Police cameras in the west stand area near the                                       Police
control           box.                     I    also entered the control box and           spoke       to
P.C. Mick              Ryan who is the regular Police Radio Operator and I
left        with           him one of the Sheffield Wednesday                      F.C.     personal
radios.           These personal radios had all been serviced prior                                    to
the      match and I distributed additional radios to each -of                                        the
a.     hoaH Stawardb; 1 Uu               1 to Craham Maokroil                                         and

another to                                                his Admin. Manager; 1 for the         Office
staff generally;                                 1   t o _____________ one of my    Stewards          who
performs             a flexible role at my direction; 1 for the Turnstile
Room staff; and the 12th one I retained myself.


 I     told          the               Stewards that there would be a briefing                  by    the
 Police          Inspectors at 11.15 a.m., having already been informed
 of that by Inspector Sewell.


 I     recall              that                about 11.30 a.m. I went back        to    the        Police
 control box when there were a number of other Officers present
 besides             P.C.                  Ryan.      One I recall was Sergeant         Goddard        but
 there          were others whom I cannot now recall.                          I had a          general              ,
 chat           with           them, they had no special requests, and                      I       walked               ’
 back           from there to the offices in the south stand.                               I       recall
 that when walking back briefings were then in progress in each
     of the four areas of the Ground.

                                                                                                                 '


     The    turnstiles were opened to admit ticket holders from about
     11.30 a.m.                Each set of turnstiles is covered by a CCTV c M ^ r a
     and    there              is a facility for recording the pictures taken                           by
     each       of     t   h   o   s   e       cameras.     Each video tape however       lasts       onl]
     3 hours and we discussed the position and agreed that we
     only switch on the cassettes from 12.30 p.m.

                                                                                                            •1

    I        recall       that                    at about 12 noon I                  checked    on     the        computer
    print-out            and at that stage there were 600 ticket                                               holders in
    the        Ground.                    I walked around the outside of the                                   stadium to
    check          on the position, and there were at that stage a                                                   number
    of         fans       in              the area              but        many        more     Nottingham           Forest
    supporters                than Liverpool supporters.                                    In walking around               the
    Ground          I     checked with                          all        the        Car     Park     attendants           and
    reminded             them                 of the arrangements for that day                              where         there
    were        2 different types of car park ticket - one for those who
    were        entitled to park and leave their cars, and one a                                                      permit
    merely          allowing                          people to drop off passengers.                          I     reminded
    them        also          that any vehicle not in the car park by 2.30                                                 p.m.
^   should          be excluded until 5 minutes after kick-off - this is a
    standard             procedure                          on busy match days, to avoid any                         traffic
    hazard          with              the              large number of fans who would                         be     in     the
    vicinity.
                                                                                                                                      *
        I    was      back                in the offices by about 12.30                              p.m.     and     having
        checked         with                  the office staff I re-entered the control                                    room
        where      P.C. H a r o l d Guest was present for the Police,                                               together
        with       Roger Houldsworth and a representative from the                                                   Company
        who had installed the CCTV system.


        At     about 1 p.m. I left the control room, which is imrnediately
a       adjacent         to               the           players'       entrance, and went                   out     to      that
        entrance         where                        I .met with Superintendent Glynn Marsh                             and      a
        Police          Sergeant. . Superintendent Marsh explained that he                                                   had .
        come       out        to              see        the    Police           operation           generally,           having
        recently          taken over an operations' group in the Force, and                                                       I
        gave . him            and                 the Sergeant a tour of the                         control        room.         I
        recall          that              at           about        that time I also             had     a         visit;                 o
        Inspector             Calvert                       who had been called in to assist                         at     this
        special          match,                       and     was     in charge of the Kop                   area     of       th«
        Ground.           I knew him well of course, Inspector Calvert havin'
        been my           L   i   Officer in the days when I was involved ii

Sometime       between 1.35 and 1.45 p.m. the Liverpool team                                   coach
arrived, followed shortly afterwards by the Notts. Forest team
coach.     I recall that outside the players' entrance there were
a     number    of fans awaiting the arrival, again                         mainly           Notts.
Forest     fans       but some Liverpool fans also.                    A number         of             the
fans     were pressing forward at the arrival of the players, and
a Mounted Police Officer eased his horse through the crowd and
pushed     them back.          I clearly recall that the Mounted                        Officer
was     wearing a white shirt which would indicate to me that                                              he
was     brought       in to assist from an outside Police Force -                                      The
South     Yorks.       Police wear regulation blue shirts.                            I--recall
this     instance          particularly for 2 reasons - in the course                                      of
the     manoeuvre the horse seemed to be a little excitable, and
a     middle-aged man with a Liverpool accent complained that the
horse     had     stepped          on his foot and indeed his                   footwear               was
visibly        dented.        I recall that Kenny Dalglish, the                        Liverpool
Manager,        went       to speak to the fan, and Superintendent                              Roger
Greenwood        was present and I suggested to him that the                                  Police
horse     was     unnecessary for the type of duty at                           the     players'
entrance.             He     agreed     that       South      Yorks.       Police       did                not
normally        use        Mounted     Officers in that situation,                     and           said
that     he would deal with the matter at the later                              de-briefing.
Superintendent               Greenwood         was       in   charge       of    the
contingent        on        duty     on the pitch.            I walked      down       from
players'        entrance through the players' tunnel on to the pitch
with     him     and after chatting for a little while                           returned                   to
                                                                   •   •

areas            of        the         Ground                were     filling     up     first.            This        was
demonstrated                    both             on        the      T . v . monitors     and    also             on     the

Control              Room         for            e a c h     of the CCTV cameras           trained               on     the

there           is        an      extra               monitor which is linked                  to        the      Police

Between               2.30            and           2.40         p.m.     it   was     noticeable              that        a
 significant                   number of fans were arriving at the Leppings Lane
 end            of    the             Ground.                This       was    noticeable       in         particular
 through              the Police monitor from the Police camera situated on
 top       of         the        south west corner of the west stand.                                        I     recall
 that           at     about 2.40 p.m. there was an announcement                                             over       the
 Police              radio            {P.C. Guest had one in the Control                                  Room)        that
 Leppings              Lane            was closed to traffic because of the                                      build-up
 in       that         area.           I looked on the monitor at the Leppings                                         Lane
 picture               and             I recall the impression I had was                                               that
  immediately                   outside                the turnstiles in the area of the                              metal
  gate          there           was          a     v e r y    tight crush of people.                     Just         behind
  them          was        an area which did not seem so densely                                         packed,         and
  then          further behind again in Leppings Lane there seemed to be
  a     solid             c r u s h    o f       people coming along.                  .1..cannot say: ..hcwfyer
  that          I     noticed any evidence of misbehaviour among                                               the      fan®
  near          the         turnstile                      area.     However there was              a      substantial
  number             of        fans waiting to get into the ground with                                          kick-off

  time approaching.


  By       2.50 p.m. the computer showed that there were about 45,000
   fans          in the Ground.                            I cannot recall any report of                       problems
   but          on    the             Police               monitor it was         noticeable             that ; crowd?
   outside            the Leppings Lane gates had increased, a n d . t h ^ g ^

pushing        forward         and there was quite a crush.                         The       computer
print-out           indicated that there were about 2,000 spaces                                 still
to        be filled'in the north stand area, and about 2, 500 in                                      the
west        stand area as I recall.                       On the monitor I saw a               Mounted
Police        Officer         in the crowd at the Leppings Lane end and                                he
seemed        to be the same Officer as had earlier been involved at
the players'          entrance.             From the T.V. picture his horse seemed
to        shy and slip into something of a splayed leg position, and
then recovered and this was an indication to me that the crush
out        there was increasing.                    Then suddenly Gate C opened and                      a
crowd        of spectators burst through and P.C. Harold Guest                                        said
something like "The gate's gone” .                             I immediately left the room
 in        something       of a hurry, as I was concerned that this                               could
 cause        problems         and       that           further help might          be       needed     in
 manning           that gate or indeed other gates around the Ground                                    to
 which        the     problem            of fans trying to get                in    quickly          could
 spread.            Because of that, on my way out of the Control                                    Room,
 I        indicated to P.C. Janet Cruttenden who was just outside the
 Directors'           entrance, that she should step inside the entrance
 if        there     were any trouble and to the 2 administrative                                    staff
 who        were at the players' entrance I said that I would arrange
 for        extra        Stewards.              I   called                          ]. the       Senior
 Steward           in the south stand area, to join me at the Directors'
 entrance           and      I asked him to provide 2 burly Stewards at                                the
 entrance           to     reinforce the staff there, explaining                              what     had

 h a p p e n e d   at C Gate.


 From        then I wanted to make my way over to the C Gate and went
 down        the players' tunnel on to the pitch,                             h s I walked           along
  the        side    towards the west stand area I met                             Graham      MackreJ.1
     about     half way between the tunnel                       a n d   the Police control box.
     I     told him my concern as to what                      h a d     happened at Gate C,            ^nd
     he     said     "Leave        i t   t o    m e ”    and turned and went back               in     tha|
     direction.          I recall looking and seeing that
     and     south       “w i n g s "     o f   the L e p p i n g s Lane t e r r a c i n g     were     n<

     over-crowded,          b u t the c e n t r e pen seemed very full.                              ;; ^

    I       started to return, and at this stage the players from                                         both
    teams       were on the pitch but the match had nor started yet.                                            I
    had        to wait, because the gangway towards the players'                                     tunnel
    was crowded with members of the media waiting for Brian Clougn
    to        arrive.      He came down and sat in his seat, and then I                                       was
    able        to w a l k back up through the players' tunnel speaking                                        to -
    the        Stewards as X did so.                      1 went b « * i n t o t h e C o n t r o l        Room
    and        Harold      Guest said to me, in a                                       voice        "Doug,
    they have opened the gates".                              Roger Houldsworth was not there. L
    I        ran back through the players'                          tunnel shouting as I ran into
    my        personal          radio calling up the Chief Steward at                           the^ west
    end,          Stuart         Thorpe,             asking him what is happening.                   I        ran
m           into Graham         Mackrell and someone I now know as Glen                            Kirton,
    an        F.A.     official, and told them that the Police                              had      opened
    the        gates       at     the Leppings Lane end of the                        Ground.        Graham
        responded        to      the          effect "Can we get them in, are we                         up    to
        capacity?"         and       I responded that we were not.                      I made my             way
        down    towards the west stand and then saw people climbing over
        the     perimeter fences at that end of the pitch.                                At that point
        a     Police Officer went onto the pitch and asked the Referee to

        stop the game.


        There     was a mass of people around the perimeter fence                                        behind
        the     goal     area and X am not able to say whether the gates                                        in
A            the perimeter fence were opened to allow people out.                                    I could
®            see that      some people were being lifted over the top                                of        the
        fence,       people appeared to be lying on the ground injured, and
        many were       w a n d e r i n g '   around in a dazed condition and in obvious
        distress.           I     helped         a    n u m b e r   o f   people in that     state            back
        towards        the players' tunnel area and into the south stand                                        so
        that they could be comforted and helped.                                 I recall that one of
        the     Assistant           Caretakers, named                          [said we     needed            more
        stretchers            from      the      Tea        Bar.          I went in   and    got         the
        stretchers          which         were stored on top of the cupboard in                               th<

At       one     point I recall that Brian Clough stopped me and                                said
"Sir,          I want you to find the Directors and the F.A. Officials
and       tell them I am putting my players in the bath and                                taking
them           home."    Mr. Clough knew that I worked with the Club                             for
I        had     been introduced to him earlier that day.                     I was            aware
of        the     fact     that      there       was a    meeting     going    on         in      the
Directors'              room    to     discuss the situation, which                 was        still
unclear           and I went into that room to tell the Directors                               what
Mr.        Clough had said.             The message, in effect, was that                        there
could           be no thought given to re-commencing the game when                                the
problem           had     been dealt with - of course, at that                       time,        the
full nature of the tragedy was not known.


 It       was at about that point I realised that there had been                                   no
 announcement over the Public Address System in accordance with
 the       emergency           arrangements        and procedures laid              down.         The
 South          Yorkshire        Police are in charge of the                Public         Address
 System           in the sense that they have an override system and the
    emergency procedures stipulated that the Police would make the
    necessary           broadcast.        I    therefore used my personal radio                   and
    instructed all Stewards to unlock the gates around the ground.
    I     got replies from some of them only, and I recall I spoke to
                           and asked him to get round and ensure                         that     the
    gates were opened all the way around.


    I     recollect        that      I was also          approached    by
    Roger        Greenwood who said he wanted to take Kenny Dalglish
    Brian        Clough        to the Police Control Box to broadcast                      to
    crowd        in the Ground         a n d   explain the position and I took
    there by a relatively unobstructed route.
                                                                               ■.   •.


     I    subsequently           had     a request over the radio from                    the
     Stewards       to     allow       the men to stand down pending                     the
     eventually leaving the Ground through the gates
     opened,       but     I refused that request on the
     attendance was still required whilst the crowd
Since    the tragic      events on 15th April I have     been   able     to
watch    the video       recording of the position at    the    gates    at
Leppings Lane, through the Club'a own static camera trained on
those    gates.      I    now realise that the initial event     when     a
crowd    of   spectators        burst into the Ground through   Gate     C,
which    caused me to first leave the Control Room, was in            fact
subsequently      controlled       after a number of fans had gone      in.
They     apparently       got    in when the Police were attempting      to
eject    some of the spectators inside,         through Gate C.' It     was
after    that, it seems, that the order         was given by the'"Police
for Gate C to be opened to allow spectators in.


I   have read this Statement and it is          true and correct to     the
best of my knowledge and belief,

I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to   be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a     preliminary      to the    event    I received      an    overview of    the    planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989•

I did      not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1989-

On   Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground                               at

9.45 a.m.       I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch,        listen and learn.

I took up a place            at the rear of the North Stand,                 behind CID Officers,         but

in front of the Special Constables.

It   appeared       to me    that attention         to detail was       evident    in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                             He impressed that

officers      must    act    in   a   professional      manner       which   would reflect      credit     on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and am pli fie r.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

 I   was    again    impressed        with    the   standard    of    briefing

 detail     such as    the evacuation procedures and officers                                        tl    ‘

 indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality..

 I   particularly        recall       him    saying,   "We     have    fully     tried    the   evacuation

 procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the second
  excellence;       If we       are   required         to    impliment         evacuation today,          it must be

  excellent."

  This     briefing       was    followed         by    an    up    to     date        intelligence     report    from

  Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

  Finally,     Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                     issue and

  mealing arrangements.

  It was      stressed         that   all   officers         must     be       on   their    respective    points   by


  11.15     a.m.

^After     the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

   later    into    the    operation        so I left           the      stadium        to return to my private

   vehicle.        I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

   asked if I had any tickets to sell.

   There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

   I went     to my vehicle            and drove            to Hammerton Road               Police   Station where I

   carried out some outstanding clerical work.

   I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

   Station,        when    a    police      car    offered         me      a    lift    to    the    ground.     This    I

   accepted.

   I saw Policewoman              Smith and another                officer outside Threshers               near Holme

    Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.,;.;

    I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

    officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

    I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

    and not in uniform.

    All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

    at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

    By Hillsborough             Park I saw a group of people                        sitting around,        there was a

    white plastic carrier bag with them and                                the outline of cans could be seen.
The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There    were    six men        and    they were joking               about       having        todrink the lot        as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By    Leppings    Lane        gates    were        few    supporters,         road    clear,      plenty    of Police

officers evident.

I    went   to   the     barrier           at    Leppings       Lane/Vere         Road    where    I    spoke    to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                                         A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I    then   walked      past        Leppings           Lane   gates    and    came       to    barriers    and   Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                            There were no

other people           near    this    area.            I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell              the    necessity           to provide     a sterile             area to keep opposing

 fans separate.

I    continued     along       the    road        being       the   South    Stand    past      the T.V.    unit      vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

 I produced my          warrant       card,        but    I was      known    to     one officer who I did not

 know.

 I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

 I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow of people, it                                               was

 very busy.

 I    stopped    and     spoke        to    Police        Constable         Vallance       from     A     Division     and

 Police     Constable                           from    ’A'    Division      at    separate       points   butdue       to
                                                                                                                             .   ■■
                                                                                                                                 -

                                                                                                                             , ...    :.

                                                                                                                             \ ■
    I returned to rear of South Stand.

 About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

 There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                                    The procedure      was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

t    left   this     area   and    returned    to Penistone         Road       as     Iintended      to    use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.              At that time about one hour to kick off.

    I knew there      was    a Liverpool      train due at Wadsley                  Bridge    around 2.05 p.m.

    but decided to go into the ground.

    I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

    card   issued    to me    by Superintendent           Murray.         Both      were     fully   checked    and

    examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

    I was assured no unauthorised person would                     gain entry at that gate .

    I went down      onto    the     perimeter      track and was         immediately surprised by how

    full the Spion Kop was.-          I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

    I made my way to the Police Control box.

    Inspector      Sewell    had   alerted     me   to    the     fact    that       inside     there     was   only

    limited space.          I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in


    the way.

    I wanted    to    see    the     Control    point      as     I was   at     Doncaster Rovers when the

    camera equipment         was     first    installed and operated                 at   the beginning of the

    present    season.       The    engineer    was      always    quoting          the    Sheffield      Wednesday

    system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
should oper ate .

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at   the      front     and       Police       Constable       Bichard       at     the    rear     by   the     camera

operating controls.

I was      informed      by       Police       Sergeant      Goddard       that    Superintendent         Murray      had

gone     to    speak    to the       referee         so I sat       on his        seat    and was    offered a hot

drink.        It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant        Chief       Constable          (Operations)         Mr.     Jackson       came     to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw      through    the       control          room    window     Superintendent          Murray      and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,                     in uniform, walking along the track.                         They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

 I was prepared to l e a v e , but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

 I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space,                                             the Notts

 Forest       parts    I could       see       on   the    South Stand and           the    Spion    Kop were quite

 full.

 I   recall     Chief        Superintendent           Duckenfield       commenting          about    there     being no

 entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

 I   remember         when    I    was     a   child       there    always     being      a band    playing      by    the

 players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

 Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

 a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                                When

 I looked the person was jiggling around.                              I remember thinking how empty the

 area around this youth                    was.       Police       Constable      Bichard operated the camera

 and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was    aware      the     area    in Leppings          Lane       behind      the    goal    was       filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was    then aware that both teams came                           onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                              The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                         All was good humoured.

The     area   behind       the    goal    at    Leppings          Lane    was    getting       full      but     there      was

space    at the       front.        People seemed reluctant                     to move forward,              probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2 .30 p .in.

I     looked   on     the    left     monitor          and    was    aware       there       seemed      a    build     up    of

 su pporters.

 I remember asking Superintendent Murray about t h i s , he explained that due to

 necessary       segregation         of    fans,       access       to    the    North       Stand,      which had been

 allocated       to    Liverpool          supporters,          could       only       be    done    by       Leppings        Lane

 entrances,       this      meant     that       the    entrances          on    Penistone         Road      to   the     stand

 which would normally be used were unavailable.

 This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

 I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

 fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

 People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

 An     engineer       came        into    the     room       to     try     and       improve       transmission             and

 reception.

 I    remember        him    in    blue    under        the    control          room   bench,       I    thought        it    was

 crowded as Police Sergeant Goddeard was walking round/over him.
I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware          Superintendent Marshall          requested     the   closure of Leppings          Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation                       for quite a time.            It was not

extraordinary.          I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                         the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                                     The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on     the   screen.         Having seen them at close           hand control        the crowd when the

 team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

 to assist officers outside.

 Around       this    time      a radio    message    was   relayed   requesting       the     gates   to    be

 opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

 I remember thinking,                 you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

 is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

 and    may    create       a   difficult    public    order     situation     for    Police    inside      the

 groun d.

 The     gates       were       not    authorised    to     be   opened   by    Chief     Sueprintendent

 Duckenfield at this time.

 I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start c o u M not

 be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
                                                   -8-




Police Control.

It    occurred        that some    Liverpool    supporters     were    leving it late but       people

often enter after the start of many games.

About       this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to    the    controllers.         I then saw the      gates displayed on the camera which I

believe       are     the concertina    gates    on   the   service     road    to the      rear of   the

South Stand           open and a surge of people rush into the ground. I said,                        The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.              It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate .

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent          Marshall     again    requests   the   gates    to be opened.         This    is a

 general request.

 It is getting close to kick off time.

 I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

 arrival of the two teams.

 It    seems    the    Superintendent        will have   to try and prevent the start of the

 game as the          fans will not all get in but I thought                 there     is no way anyone

 can get to the referee or team managers to do this at this late stage.                               As I

 was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                           I Ve no idea which

 team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

 I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

 At    this    point    Superintendent Marshall          requested     the     gates   to be opened as

 there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in th<3 crush

 if they were not opened.

 There was still room on the terrace under the control.                           The South Stand was
                                                                                         -

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave the general    instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.          The play was

 at the Penistone Road end.

 I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

 onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

 direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

 The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

 Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

 but then stopping and standing watching the game.

 A   Policewoman was in control of the gate into the   area   where   there was space

 but did not open i t .

 I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

 open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

 I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

 control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got *

  the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.         More

  and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate

  and the Policewoman assisted.
I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could       see   people   pushed    up    against    the     fence      but    not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries                 as there      is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More      and more      people on the track and beginning                  to move   onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence , having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run       to    control   but    by   the uncovered      seats      I meet    Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.                       We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

    I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

 Terrac e.

    I think it is a public order situation.

    As   they are      Liverpool    supporters,    I run onto the playing area and protect

    Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

    When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

    people spilling onto the playing area.                 There is quite clearly in my mind a

    major    public     order   situation      which   will    need    a    large uniform presence        to


    control.

    I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

    There is nothing I can usefully do in a public oder context so I decide to

return to the Police Control point.

En    route      I    am    passed       by    uniformed       reinforcements            as   I   pass      through      the

uncovered seating.

On    re-entering              control    room    I    learn    that      persons       are     suspected          of   being

injured.

An    ambulance           is    called    for    and    quickly      arrives        behind        the    Leppings        Lane

goal.

A    message         is relayed       to Police        control      that     many       people     are      injured.       As

they are not local people,                     Chief Superintendent               Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable,                                 Mr.   Jackson,        to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've    no       accurate        assessment       of   time,       but    this    call    should be          recorded          on

tape        in   Force      Control.          Coins    or   other        items    are    being     thrown          at Police

Control          in large        numbers.        In view of the situation unfolding,                               'Operation

Support' is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I     suggest         I    go    to   Hammerton        Road    Police       Station       and     receive          Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground C o ntr ol.

I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

 I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

 in a marked Police car.                      He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I transferred to 'P' Division on Monday 3 April 1 9 8 9 , as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event In order to observe the Police operation.

As   a preliminary to the event        I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1 9 8 9 .

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1 98 9 .

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.45 a.m.     I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared      to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                 He impressed that

officers must       act   in a professional manner which would reflect             credit on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible
                                    lible at the rear by use of a microphone




This part was followed by Superintendent Murray...
                                                                                      ... v          ;
I was    again    impressed   with   the   standard    of briefing, again attentio
                                                                                ;ion:-' t o ■

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being .aware..of.,tiiMr

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I    particularly    recall   him    saying, "We      have   fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time was good                the second time ,«aa
excellence;        if we       are   required         to impliment           evacuation today,          it must be

excellent."

This    briefing         was     followed        by   an     up    to       date    intelligence      report    from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,     Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                       issue and

mealing arrangements.

It   was    stressed         that    all    officers       must        be   on     their   respective      points    by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later      into    the       operation      so   I    left    the       stadium      to return      to my private

vehicle.         I was approached           on three separate occasions in Penistone Roadand

asked if I         had any tickets to sell.

There were         a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went      to     my vehicle           and drove      to Hammerton Road Police                   Station where       I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

Station,      when       a     police      car   offered          me    a   lift     to    the   ground.      This    I

accepted.

I saw Policewoman Smith and another                           officer         outside Threshers         near Holme

Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                          there was a

white plastic carrier bag with them and                                the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                             -3-




The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There    were      six men and             they were       joking     about      having       to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15- p.m.

By   Leppings        Lane      gates       were    few     supporters,       road   clear,       plenty    of Police

officers evident.

I    went    to    the     barrier         at     Leppings       Lane/Vere       Road        where   I spoke     to 'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                                        A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I    then    walked      past        Leppings       Lane    gates     and    came       to    barriers    and    Police

Officers       - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                     There were no

other       people      near    this    area.        I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector         Sewell       the    necessity       to provide       a sterile             area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued          along      the    road       being    the     South    Stand past         the T.V.    unit    vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant                  card,       but    I was     known    to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the                                         flow of people, it was

very b u s y .

I    stopped      and     spoke       to    Police        Constable    Vallance          from    'A'   Division       and

Police       Constable                      from     'A'    Division        at   separate       points    but   due    to

enquiries         and    sheer numbers            of persons        it was prudent            to move on,       as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses control 1 inr a large crowd
awaiting the trains a rr iva l.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the         Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                        The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems,              crowd good humoured.

I left    this    area    and returned       to Penistone            Road   as I     intended   to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.            At that time about one hour                  to kick off.

I knew     there was      a Liverpool       train due at Wadsley               Bridge around 2.05        p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went    to the main       sliding gate and produced my warrant                       card and a special

card   issued     to me     by    Superintendent            Murray.     Both were fully       checked     and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went    down    onto    the    perimeter       track and was immediately surprised by how

full the Spion Kop was.            I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector    Sewell       had    alerted    me    to    the     fact    that    inside    there   was    only

limited space.          I intended to visit,            see it operated and leave if I was in

the way.

I wanted     to   see    the    Control     point      as    I was     at   Doncaster Rovers      when    the

camera    equipment      was    first   installed       and operated           at   the beginning of the

present    season.        The    engineer    was    always       quoting       the   Sheffield Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as                            the way all grounds
should o p er ate .

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at     the     front    and      Police      Constable       Bichard    at     the      rear    by   the      camera

operating controls.

I was        informed    by      Police     Sergeant    Goddard       that    Superintendent          Murray        had

gone     to    speak    to    the   referee     so I sat on his              seat   and was      offered a hot

drink.        It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant        Chief       Constable       (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson          came    to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw      through    the      control     room     window    Superintendent            Murray       and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,                  in uniform, walking along the track.                       They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave,                   but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest        parts    I could      see     on the   South Stand        and    the Spion Kop were quite

fu ll.

I recall        Chief    Superintendent          Duckenfield      commenting            about   there      being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I    remember     when       I   was   a    child    there    always    being       a   band    playing       by    the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                              When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                         I remember thinking how empty the

area around           this youth was.           Police Constable         Bichard operated the camera

and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was    aware        the   area     in Leppings            Lane    behind      the goal was           filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was    then aware           that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                             The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                      All was good humoured.

The    area behind          the    goal    at Leppings             Lane was       getting       full    but     there was

space at the front.                  People seemed reluctant                    to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I     looked   on     the     left    monitor         and    was    aware        there    seemed       a    build      up    of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary        segregation         of    fans,      access       to     the    North    Stand,       which had           been

allocated        to    Liverpool          supporters,         could       only     be    done    by     Leppings           Lane

entrances, this             meant     that      the    entrances          on    Penistone       Road       to   the    stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An     engineer        came       into    the    room        to     try    and     improve        transmission              and

reception.

I     remember      him     in    blue     under      the     control       room    bench,       I     thought        it    was

crowded as Police Sergeant Godd^ard was walking round/over h i m ._____
I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware          Superintendent Marshall requested                the   closure of Leppings           Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                                    It was not

extraordinary.             I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                           the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                                      The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on    the    screen.        Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around       this    time      a radio    message    was    relayed    requesting         the   gates   to    be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember          thinking,        you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and    may    create       a    difficult   public       order   situation       for   Police    inside      the

ground.

The    gates        were       not    authorised    to     be    opened     by    Chief     Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It    occurred      that    some    Liverpool   supporters    were   leving      it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About    this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to    the controllers.             I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe       are   the     concertina    gates   on   the   service road       to    the   rear   of    the

South Stand open            and a surge of people       rush into the ground.               I said,     "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.                It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the g a t e .

People however            are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent            Marshall    again requests   the   gates       to   be opened.      This      is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi                  circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It    seems    the Superintendent         will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the fans will                not all get in but I thought there is no way anyone

can get to the referee               or team managers to do this at this late stage.                    As I

was    thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                            I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At    this    point       Superintendent Marshall      requested     the      gates    to   be opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside                              in the crush

if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.                           The South Stand was

much fuller but not full.                                            I
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident    there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall   him thinking aloud words      to the effect   - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray,       "Open the Gates".

Superintendent    Murray   gave   the general   instruction   over   the radio   to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked;back onto the playing area.            The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter        track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

but then stopping and standing watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open it.

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

control point,    through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.              More

and more     were coming onto the track,     I was ushering them to the open gate

and the Policewoman assisted.
                                                  -10-




I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could    see   people     pushed    up   against     the     fence   but   not   aware   of    any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More    and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run    to    control   but    by   the uncovered        seats   I meet   Superintendent       Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.                    We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

T e rra ce.

I think it is a public order situation.

As    they are      Liverpool   supporters,       I run onto the playing area and protect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people spilling onto the playing area.                   There is quite clearly in my mind a

major    public     order    situation    which    will    need    a large uniform presence          to

control.

I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

                                                                                      TL.     A ,
There is nothing I can usefully do in a public c^er
return to the Police Control point.

En    route    I   am       passed    by   uniformed        reinforcements          as    I   pass    through     the

uncovered seating.

On    re-entering           control    room    I    learn     that    persons       are    suspected     of    being

injured.

An    ambulance        is    called    for    and     quickly       arrives    behind         the   Leppings    Lane

goal.

A    message    is relayed           to Police      control        that many people           are    injured.      As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable,                            Mr.    Jackson,        to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've    no    accurate        assessment       of    time,    but    this    call    should         be recorded    on

tape    in    Force     Control.           Coins    or     other    items    are    being      thrown    at Police

Control       in large        numbers.        In view of       the situation unfolding,                 'Operation

Support' is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I    suggest       I   go     to   Hammerton        Road    Police     Station       and      receive    Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

in a marked Police car.                He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

makeshift serials.

I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

enquiry room.
                                             -12-




Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is   little   further   which   is   of   benefit   regarding     the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself     involve   reception    and      sympathetic   welfare    of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

PERSCNfiL REECiP OF EVENTS AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND CN 15IH APRIL, 1989

I an a Senior Registrar in Diagnostic Radiology in Sheffield. On the 15th April, 1989,
I attended the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground at Hillsborough. I was at the edge
of the Kop, in the Nottingham Forest and.

When the match was stopped and spectators frcm the Leppings Lane end cane onto the
pitch, all I saw initially were people who were limping- At this time I did not see
anybody lying cn the ground. However, after what must have bean probably 10 minutes,
I realised that the situation was obviously more serious and made ny way down onto
the pitch.

At approximately 3.15 p.m. I want to the Leppings Lane end of tine pitch. There were
many bodies round the gDal with a large number of spectators and police. Only a f^nall
number of these bodies were being administered to at this time- Having already contacted
a senior police office cn the pitch I set about examning as many of the bodies that
I could. I was then accompanied by a female psychiatric nurse frcm Liverpool, whose
name I do not know.

I exanined probably up to 20 people. In ny opinion the majority of these were already
dead. Together with the nurse and several other spectators I administered and organised
basic resuscative rreasures to approximately 6 or 7 people. This comprised cf nouth
to mouth resuscitation and external cardiac massage. There was no available oxygen
equipment, airways or any means of suction. Several of the people whcm I saw had vanit
within their mouths and throats and would clearly have benefited frcm suction.

On only one patient did I feel that external cardiac massage and other resuscitative
techniques had been successful. This patient was subsequently transferred to an aabulance
and taken to the hospital. The other people whcm I dealt with oould not be resuscitated.
There were a great many people standing around, sane of whan were extremely qgitated.
This sanewhat hampered the ability to assess any patients who wxild have benefited
fran imnediate resuscitation. The overall situation was obviously very confused at
this point. The only physician that I was aware of at this time was Dr. Purcell, the
Sheffield Wednesda/ Club doctor. After approximately 20-30 minutes when it had beccme
apparent that the remaining people at the Leppings Lane and were already dead and
those which had bean resuscitated had bean sent to hospital, I went down to the other
and of the football pitch (the Kop end). I was accompanied by Dr. Purcell and two
nurses fran Liverpool. Between the four’of us we then attempted resuscitation on 4
more people on the pitch. None of these attempts were successful. By this time a
great many people were being carried on advertising hoardings off the pitch. Several
patients to ray knowledge had been transferred by arfoulance to the local hospitals.
There was still no cxygen available or any other aids for resuscitation, as far as
I was aware.

When it became apparent that there were no further people for resuscitation at the
Kop end, a police officer then requested that we gD into the Sheffield Wednesday gmnasium
which had bean converted into a temporary mortuary.

In the mortuary there were lines of people lying on the floor. Together with a local
G.P., Dr. Redgrave, I then examined as many of these people as I could. All the people
that I examined within the gymnasium were in ray opinion already dead. I examined
approximately 20 people within the gymnasium. No resuscitative attempts were made
within the gymnasium. In each case I certified the person to be dead and notified
the attending policeman that in ray opinion the patient was dead and gave the policeman
ray name.

When we were satisfied that we had examined all the people on the floor I waitedfor
further instructions fran the police. No further duties were required of me       andat
appradmatley 5.45 p.m. I left the Sheffield Wednesda/ Football ground.

The points which I feel are important are as follows:

1. There were no calls via the public address system for medical and nursing staff
to help. It was only after 10 minutes that I realised fncm the other end of the ground
that the situation was so grave.

2. As far as I was aware, there were no aids for resuscitation, such as oxygen, airways,
or suction device to clear vcmit fncm the mouth.

3. Assessment of patients on the field, sane of whan may have bean able to be resuscitated
was hampered by a large nurfjer of people, many of than very agitated.

I hope this is of scrne value. If further     information is required I shall of   course
be willing to provide it.

I,     ROGER        HOULDSWORTH         of

                WILL STATE



I     am 4 2 years old and up to the week coxranenci.ng 10th April                               I

was     employed          as     Technical     Director    by        M.W.       (Technology)

Limited        of       Sheffield.       I had been employed in that                   capacity

for     some        2    years until I resigned my position.                     I     hold     an

H.II.C.    qualification               as an Electronics Engineer.                    Prior     to

working        with       M.W.     (Technology)     Limited          I    had        previously

worked     for          more     than 10 years abroad,          in       the     electronics

field.



When I returned from working abroad,                  in 1986,           I was approached

by     the then Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football

Club,     Dick          Chester,       who asked me to assist in                relation        to

certain        problems          the    Club   were having      with           their       closed

circuit        television          systems     (CCTV).     I understand              the      CCTV

system     then installed had been put in place by Philips Alarms

in     about        1984 but that Company had subsequently gone out                             of

business.



I     did look at the system at Mr. Chester's request and as then

designed and installed it was not working properly.
Short!v           afterwards             I   joined M.W.         (Technology)        Limited        and

enlist           “heir          empiovee      I     completed my         examination         of     the

ixiotir.a             -ystem and rs-designed it to improve the system                               and

            -he        computer system related. to it.                     I also     re-designee

the     CCTV           system          which had been installed by              the      Club       ror

Police        use - this being a separate system from that                                  operated

bv the Club for its own purposes.



The Clue System

This        consisted of a number of static T.V.                           cameras situated at

strateaic               points          around     the     ground.       As   a result       of    my

examining              the       system I arranged for some additional                       cameras

to     be        installed to enhance it, particularly when                            the        Spion

Kop oart              of the ground was re-opened in 1986.



3eina        a        static system the cameras are in a fixed position                             and

focus            on         a    particular        fixed        area.     They were         in     fact

positioned at                   strategic         points    to            view the       turnstile

entrances,                  and there was also a camera covering the                        players'

entrance.               Within the CCTV room,               situated in the south                 stand

near        the        players'         entrance,     there is a bank          of     20 monitors

plus        a mon itor for the computer system.                           This computer system

records               the       number of spectators who come through the turn ­

stiles                for       each     separate        area    ofthe     ground.     Of           the

20 monitors                 within the control room,               19 display the scene              as

depicted              in the Club's          static system.             The remaining        monitor

is connected to the Police CCTV system.
Each        of    the monitors                connected          to the Cl ub           jys te n    is in           turn

installed,                     which        obstructed           that     camera's           view            of      the

relevant              turnstiles.                  The    turnstiles       in q u e s t i o n were                 those

numbered              ? - 16           w hic h       will       be referred         to      later            in     this

5 tatement.



The    Police             system

This         consisted                 of     5      fully       functional             rem ot e        controlled

cameras           - i.e.             those c a m e r a s could pan            tilt       through 260°,               and

zoom        on        a        16/160       lens.        They are c o n t r o l l e d       from         a        Police

control           box           which        is    fixed in position at                    the      south          west

corn er          of        the        ground,        ad ja ce nt   to the w e s t e r n            end        of     the

south            stand.                The        c a me ra s    for    the        Police          system            are

positioned                as follows



        1        on        the        upper so ut h west corner                    of     the      west

        stand;



        2        are           positioned          on the top of the s o u t h                   stand,

        1 at              about its c e n t r e po in t and the o t h e r                    to      the

        ea st er n end of the                      stand at the top;

Within the Police control box there are 7 T.V. monitors,                                                o:

them        -re dedicated,             1 to each of the CCTV cameras.                        The other

2     are      connected to special                time   lapse Video      Recorders,                  and

VQU    can        switch from camera to camera by means of                               a      passive

switch         within the control room so that the Officer in                                    Charge

can     record           the        scene    being displayed on any             1        of      the     5

cameras.               The     remaining       2   monitors are used           so            that      the

Officer          can         check which of the 5 cameras are being                           recorded

at     anv       civen time.            ?.C. Trevor Bishop was          the         Officer            who

worked         the       CCTV system for the Police but it was                           not        usual

for     him to be alone in the control room - there might perhaps

be     3 or 4 other Officers in there with him at any given                                          time

for     their own reasons - e.g.                    to watch a section of the                       crowd

from ar. elevated position.



Within         the Police control box there is also a telephone                                      land

line        w h i ch     is     part of Sheffield Wednesday             F . C . ’s            internal

telephone              system,        and    the Police have       their       own            separate

telephone          land lines installed also.



The events of Saturday,                      15th April,    1989

Although           I     had previously resigned my position as                              Technical

Director          of         M.W.    (Technology)     Limited I was asked by                    Graham

Mackrell          to         attend     at     the ground on that day               in        case     my
assistance was required.                          We knew that the F.A.          Cup semi-final

between        Liverpool                 F.C.     and     Nottingham Forest           F.C.        was     a

sell-out           all ticket match and I arrived at the ground                                   fairly

early         on     the Saturday morning to check that everything                                      was

in     order.        I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the

Police        CCTV       cameras,              the one at the south west              corner           near

the     score board.                    I checked it,       found it was not           functioning

properly           and        I        made the necessary adjustments to                    the        iris

controls           within the camera and thereafter checked that it was

working        OK.            Late        in the morning I then went              to        the        CCTV

control        room where P.C.                   Harold Guest was also in              attendance,

as     usual.            In       addition            there was present     Doug           Lock,        the

Security           Officer for Sheffield Wednesday F.C.                         ana

of     M.W.        (Technology).                 P.C. Guest, as a matter              of     routine,

would     have           ensured early in the morning that cassette                                   tapes

were     inserted                 in     the     19 VCRs - 1 of course           would           not     be

recording           a picture because the camera was out of action                                      but

P.C.     Guest           would           nevertheless routinely load all                    19.         The

authorised           crowd              capacity        figures for each section                 of     the

ground        was        part of the data stored in the computer,                            and        the

display            monitor              for     the     computer   would    show           how         many

spectators           came              through each of the turnstiles in                    operation

as     the day went on.                       The system was so designed that when the

turnstiles           for a particular area had admitted 90% capacity to

that     area, the total for that section would flash on the T.V.

screen        and if,             for example, one part of the ground was                             being

filled        up     quickly              and there was capacity           in    another               part

(subject           to segregation of supporters) that would enable                                      the
Police         to     be        aware     that       they     should     direct        remaining

supporters           to     a     different set of turnstiles.                Each          of     the

turnstiles           was        also fitted with an infra-red ray sensor,                           so

that     if     spectators              tried to climb over the             turnstiles             but

within        the     turnstile enclosure, that would also be                           recorded

on      the         screen,           under    a     separate     heading.        I         produce

[Exhibit       1]     a copy of the print-out from the computer monitor

for      the         game        in     question.       Numbers        climbing       over         the

turnstiles          within the enclosure would be shown on the                               column

headed        "Check        Total".           The     first     heading     "Gate"          is     the

turnstile           number        through which the fans entered,                  the           "Gate

Total"        shows        the        number who entered through each                  of        those

turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.



I     was present in the CCTV control room from about 11.30                                       a.m.

that     morning           when the turnstiles were opened and                        spectators

were     entering the ground.                      The Spion Kop and the south                   stand

had     been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters,                                   and the

north     stand           and    west stand          (including Leppings          Lane)          were

reserved        for        Liverpool supporters.                The authorised         capacity

for the various sections of the ground was as follows:-



                      Spion Kop                                 21,000

                      South Stand covered                        5,524

                      South Stand uncovered                      3,310

                      West Stand                                 4,465

                      Leppings Lane                             10,100

                      North Stand                                9,702
3y about 2.45 p.m. the Kop and the south stand areas were full

of     Nottingham              Forest supporters but the north stand and                     the

west     stand areas were only about 2/3 full at that time and it

was     noticeable              from the static camera covering the               Leppings

Lane     turnstiles that there was a build-up of fans outside the

turnstiles           in that area.              I produce    [Exhibit 2 ]   a plan of the

ground     showing the Leppings Lane entrance to the west and the

turnstiles           (7        in     number)    which      admit   spectators        to     the

terraced        area of the west stand are designated A/G.                        It        will
                                                                                  *
be     seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a concrete

path     which leads around eventually to the south stand.                                  That

path     is bounded on the one side                   (the south)     by the river           Don

and     on the north side by a high brick wall.                        Situated in that

wall     just        immediately            beyond the turnstiles - i.e.              to     the

east     of them - was an exit gate designated Gate C which is                                 a

double     gate           of        the   concertina metal type        which     was        kept

closed.         One        of        the static cameras of the CCTV            system        was

situated        on        a post just east of that gate,             the camera            being

positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It     was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that

camera     that it was possible to see the build-up of supporters

outside     the turnstiles.                  The Police had erected some barriers

across     the        pathway a short distance east of Gate C                     so       that

spectators           could not walk along that pathway to get access to

the south stand.                    The build-up of Liverpool supporters outside

the    Leppings Lane entrance was such that some had been forced
beyond        the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C and some

of those       supporters were visible within the field of vision of

the static camera.



The      position          was such that I recall commenting,         at     perhaps

2.5 0     p.m.,      "For God's sake why don't they delay the kick-off"

and      I    made that comment          in the presence of    Doug        Lock     and

P.C.     Guest.       We     were all,    as I recall,   in general        agreement

that     it would be sensible            to postpone the kick-off to          enable

people        to get into the ground,        although I do not recall             that

anyone        in     the     CCTV control room attempted      to     contact        the

Police        by radio or telephone to suggest that.               The Police        of

course were monitoring the situation themselves from their own

CCTV      system,      and in particular using the camera on the                  south

west      corner       of the west stand roof.      We could of course              see

that      that camera was trained on the Leppings Lane                 turnstiles

because        we were able to monitor the Police pictures on one of

the      monitors          within   our control room, although we          did      not

have the facility to record that picture.



There        came     a time- when Gate C appeared to be opened,              and     a

number        of spectators rushed through into the "reservoir" area

between        the     turnstiles and the rear of the west           stand.          An

examination           of     the video recording appears to indicate              that

this         occurred        when the Police opened the gate in an           effort

to      eject one of the spectators that way, and a number of                       the

fans     pressed through from the outside.           It would appear          that
several        hundred        got     through   before the        gates        were        again

closed.



Subsequently           the     static      camera picked up the           fact        that     a

number     of     fans        climbed up over the         structure           housing        the

turnstiles,           and     jumped down into the reservoir area                     inside.

That     is,     it     seems,        further   indication        of     the     pressures

building        up outside the turnstiles although a steady flow                              of

spectators        was coming through those turnstiles at all                           times,

in the normal way.



I     recall     that        after     the first influx      of        several        hundred

spectators        through Gate C Doug Lock left the CCTV room to                              go

outside         presumably            to   report   the   ma tter        to     the        Club

Secretary,        Graham Mackrell, and/or to check the position                              for

himself on the ground.



Some     time later,          I am unsure of the exact time,                  I heard over

the     Police     radio        (we     had one in the C CTV           room)     a     Senior

Police     Off icer         make a request that a gate be opened                      at    the

Leppings        Lane     entrance.         Police control asked which gate                   he

wished     opened           and he repeated his request 2 or 3 t i m e s .                   On

about     the     fourth occasion he said "Someone is going                           to    die

here.     Open     the gate" and Police control replied "If                          someone

is going to die open the gate, open the gate".

    As     appears           from the video tape recording the scene the                       gate

    was     then        opened apparently by a uniformed P.C.,                and        a     huge

    numoer of fans flooded into the area.



    At     that        point in time I realised,             from the     numbers        already

    displayed           on the monitor as having entered from the                       Leppings

    Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created.

    I left the room and went down the p l a y e r s ' tunnel to the pitch

    and     just        as     I     did so the Referee stopped the           match           as     I

    recall.            I looked over to the west stand area and I saw                          fans

    climbing           over the fence and my first thought at that time was

    that     it was a pitch invasion,                 and the match had been             stopped

    for     that reason.                 The perimeter fencing at that point is high

    and     not        easy        to climb over.        I sat down in the       stand         area

    behind        the        dug-out,       and watched the situation for           a        little

    time     -     perhaps 2 or 3 minutes before I realised what                             really

    was      occurring.                   One   of the    Sheffield      Wednesday           ground

    staff        came down the tunnel holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed

    one     from him and ran across with it to help ferry the injured

    people        to     the        gymnasium area where the first-aid              room           was

    situated.            It        was     in fact only after I had ferried 3                 or     4

    injured        people           in that way that I then realised             that        there

    were     many people who had died as a result,                      and the g ym was in

    fact designated as a temporary mortuary.



    After        helping           on     the   pitch as much as      possible      at       about

    4.15/4.30           p.m.       I went back to the CCTV room w h e r e _____________

    and     P.C. Guest were present,                 and I had a cup of coffee and                   a

cigarette.            Subsequently I took print-outs of the                          attendance

from the computer monitor,                 and ejected the tapes from the VCRs

leaving them in the machines in the ejected position so that I

could      later        know       exactly     which           tape     related      to         which

monitor/area.



I     normally        take     3    print-outs from              the     computer         for     the

attendance        figures,          2 of which go to the                 Secretary,         Graham

Mackrell,        and        the third will normally to the                      Ticket      Office

staff.         However        on this occasion,               since it was an          F.A.       Cup

semi-final,           all     ticket,      I   did        at     first       give    the        third

print-out        to     P.C.       Guest at his request,                since he       said       his

Superior         Officers          might     want        it.         Later    however       G r aham

Mackrell        said        that    he wanted to keep all 3                   in    his     secure

possession and I therefore retrieved it from P.C. Guest.



At about 6.15/6.30 p.m. Graham Mackrell asked me to ensure the

video     roo m was properly secured.                     _____________ and P.C.                Guest

had     left     the ground at that time.                      I went to the CCTV               room,

locked     the cupboard doors where the VCRs were and then locked

the     room and activated the alarm system for the room.                                   I kept

the     key in my possession overnight.                         On locking the            cupboard

doors     where        the     VCRs     were I           do    not     recall       specifically

checking that all the tapes were still in the machine but I do

recall     that        as I finally left            the ground at about 7.30                     p.m.

that     night,        with                                                                       the

Club,     I asked the Security Guard at the players'                                entrance       to




                                                                                                        II
                                       - 12 -



ensure    that    no-one     entered     the CCTV   room   overnight.      He

promised to do so.



I    returned to the ground at 9 a.in. on the Sunday morning              and

checked     the    room    where it was still locked       and   the    alarm

operative.        However when I opened up the room and checked the

VCRs     I found that 2 tapes were missing.         One of those was the

taoe relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 1 6 ,              and

the other was from the VCR which had not been activated at the

time.      I have no idea who removed the tapes - I mentioned              it

to     the Security Officer, Doug Lock, and he was surprised              and

    TREVOR      BICHARD
    POLICE      CONSTABLE   1370
    33 YEARS (bn® |       [)
    HAMMERTOH ROAD POLICE STATION
    HILLSBOROUGH* SHEFFIELD.
    TEL: 852211

  I am a police constable with South Yorkshire police at present stationed at Hammerton
  Road police station, Sheffield. I am at the present time working beat duties on ’Bf
  group but also have resposibility operating the static video system which is installed
  at Hillsborough football stadium jSheffield.
  On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough stadium on many occasions as a spectator
  standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop end of the ground and the leppings Lane terrace.
  1 have also worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my past 8 years
  service*
  In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system working from the police
  control box and since that time I have attended a 3 day course in relation to the use
  of video systems for command and control and as a method of evidence gathering#
  The original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a command and contol system
 -giving a basic all round view both inside and outside the ground. Whilst I have been invol-
^pbd with the duties the emphasis has shifted from command and control to evidence gathering
  and with that end in mind several improvements have been made the most recent being a
  survey of the Leppings Lane end camera, the intention being to move the camera from its
  present position attached to the roof of the West stand bringing it down to a position
  just above the turnstiles. The survey was carried out using afhand held video camera mount­
  ed on the platform of a. hydra&llc lift. Two positions were considered, the first mounted
  on a pole at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles the second position just
  above gate ’B*. It was deMeted"that the best position woulx be above ’I* gate. This position
  giving good all round views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and the court yard
  at the rear of the Leppings Lane Terrace. The system installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to
  complete a costing for the improvements and if the cash was available from the football
  trust, he would attempt to install the camera in it’s new position in time for the semi­
  final. Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be completed quick
  enough and the planned move for the camera was suspended untill the summer break.
  On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 10am attending at the police room at
  Hillsborough, collecting the hand held V.H.S. radio which I used to monitor transmissions
  via X.S. (operations room). On this particular day channel 1 had been designatiHtfor all
  V.H.F. transmission relating to the semi-final.
  After collecting the radio I ns.de my way to the Leppings Lane terrace where 1 saw that
^Koger Holdsworth was working         on camera number 5 which over looksthe LeppingsLane 'terrace
  pens# The picture quaiUJgr^had been substanded for a number of weeks ani Mr Holdsworth.-was-

  Around 10®55am that date Supt Chapman contact control regarding a group of Liverpool

  no trouble but the information was passed just Si that officer 'could be aware that groups

  Just after noon I inserted the 2 V.H,S, video tapes in the "two video recorders. The time
  and date system was checked and set possibley using the ground c l o c k mounted above the
  North stand or by a time check with, other officers in the control box. The tapes were set
  to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30pm the same date I would insert
  2 new tapes which would then include the build up to the match throughout the game and
  the supporters leaving the ground. Around this time it was noticed that persons had entered
  the ground.
  A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone Road turnstiles were not
  manned due to an, administrative error this was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials
  Some time between 1.00pm and 2.30pm there was concern expressed regarding the Liverpool fans
  purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings Lane turnstiles. This would mean of course that
  a mixture of fans would have to be supervised within,jfche Kop terrace.
 During this same period problems be&an arising in various public houses near to the ground
  ones that spring to mind were the Horse and Jockey and the Royal, The complaints were that
  fans were drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being a genral
  nuisance. Soire time between 1.30pm and 2.00pm I began to notice that on the Kop sereral
  Liverpooldfans had been placed in the trian&le area near to the North Stand end supervised
  by several police officers. I set Camera 4 to monitor the situation noticing that several
  arrests were made and that manpower was getting low. I remembered thatthere had been
  some trouble at last years match in thesame location and I questioned Supt Murray re the
  number of officers available for deployment on the Kop. Supt Murray then contacted Insp
gBprell re^rding the manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing
W o men would be on stand-by in Penistone Road,
 Around 2.00pm Supt Murl^and C/supt Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.
  Through the afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the                P.R. trans­
  missions, to the control staff.
  Around 2.00pm I overheard on V.H.F, that Liverpool supporters had bee a spoken to on a coach
 which had displayed a Nottingham forest supports parking ticket. The coach and supporters
  were spoken.to by traffic officers and advised.
  About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool fans on a coach registered
  number 9935 RU. This number was circulated and the coach checked by one of the mobile serials,
 Around 2.20pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he noticed a man on the Leppings
  Lane terrace South Pen. He dropped his trousers and began fooling about. His behaviour was
  such that it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something to be done about
  he. I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.              ;
  About 2.15pm all the control room staff discussed that it was apparent the Liverpool fans
  had not begun to arrive as yet. The North stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane
  terrace was filling up at a normal rate. Just after this the f.R, transmissions became
  worsi-^and the civilian radio repair man came into the control boar- to attempt a repair*

 I then said worts like * THEY'VE BROKEN DOWN THE GATS’. At the sane .Mae X indicated to
 the staff in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane Monitor. After about 20 seconds I
noticed that the gate was closed and itseemed that a mounted officer alone had prevented
a big rush of people through the open gate. 1 remeber seeing mounted officers trying to cleai
space in the crowd .
The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was nade to Inspector Sewell
and 1 remeber him offering two serials one of which was the ,Pt Division crime and mndal
they were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground ontothe turnstile roofs and I
in particular remeber several being sat astide Gate *B* with police officers stood below.
I think at this time a P.R. message was sent regarding the climbers and an officer replied
that he could not reach them.
Around 2.45pm I remeber a P.R. message from Supt Marshall to the effect * WE MUST OPEN THE
GATES OR SOMEONE IS GOING TO BE KILLED, PLEASE OPEN THE GATES.*
At this time C/insp McRobble is in the control box wearing civilian cl**hing.
I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at Leppings Lane end and C/supt
Ducenfield made enquries as to the officers identity. Another P.R. message was receive d
from Supt Marshall his voice was very distressed * YOU MUST OPEN THE GATES OPEN TIE Gfi-TES*.
C/Supt Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then said 1 'RIGHT IP LIVES ARE AT RISK
THEN OPEN THE GATES.* Sgt Goddard then transmitted ‘OPEN THE GATES OPEN THE GATES.»
Just prior to this I remeber seeing officers behand *A» gate, they were set out in two lines
forming a funnel. Sgt Higgins of *P. O&Y transmitted on P.R. • There are people being crushec

  remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opeaM mounted officers out­
side Leppin&s Lane turnstiles had managed to create a void between the turnstiles and the
outer perimeter railings, in fact I believed that at one time the officers managed to
close the outer gates, however the crowd outside forced its way through the outer gates
and ran into the ground via *C* gate at least. I remeber seeing crowds at therear of
Leppings Lane terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not doing
anything inparticular.
About 2.55pm C/supt Duckenfield told control room staff to get some man power to the North
stand to stop any possible rush onto the pitch. It was at this time that we began, to notice
Liverpool fans climbing up into the west stand from the terrace area. They were assisted
by people in the stand and the same problem had occured the previous year. The sole purpose
was so that fans with standing tickets could get into the seated area of the west stand.
A short tim later fan# were seen to climb the perimeter track fence. Officers on the track
seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence. At this point the staff in the v

I am a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.                   I am at the
present time working beat duties on 'B' group but also have
responsibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many
occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.                   I have also
worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my
past 8 years service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system
working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have
attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for
Command and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.                      The
original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command
and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and
outside the ground.         Whilst I have been involved with the duties
that emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence
gathering and with that end in mind several improvements have been
made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
camera, the intention being to move the camera from its present
position attached to the roof of the West Stand bringing it down to

a position just above the turnstiles.        The survey was carried out

using a hand held video camera mounted on the platform of a

hydraulic lift.      Two positions were considered, the first mounted

on a p o l e   at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

the second position just above gate      'B'.     It was decided that the

best position would be above     'B' gate.      This position giving good

all around views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and

the courtyard at the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.          The system

installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to complete a costing for the

improvements and if the cash was available from the football trust,

he would attempt to install the camera in it's new position in time

for the Semi F i n a l .

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick enough and     the planned m o v e    for the camera was

suspended until the summer     break.

On Saturday 15 April 1989,     I commenced      duty at 10 am attending at

the police room at Hillsborough, collecting          the hand held VHS radio

which I used to monitor transmissions via Operations Room.           On this

particular day channel 1 had     been designated for all VHF

transmission relating to the     Semi Final.

After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane

terrace where I saw that Roger Holdsworth was working on camera

number 5 which overlooks the     Leppings Lane terrace pens.      The

picture quality had been substandard for a number of weeks and Mr

Holdsworth was carrying out some last minute alterations to upgrade

the picture.     After he had completed the work the picture was
indeed better than it had been although not up to the correct

standard.    I then made my way to the Control Box where I met with

Sergeant Goddard and PC Ryan.    After a brief conversation I began

to check the video system operating each of the five cameras in

turn.   We were later joined by Superintendent Murray and it was

agreed between us that Sergeant Goddard would operate the personal

radio, PC Ryan the tannoy and telephone and I in addition to my

duties as camera operator would monitor the VHF set using it if

necessary.    These duties were no different to what would be carried

out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55 am that date, Superintendent Chapman contact control

regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting outside

the 5 Arches public house.    There was at this time no trouble but

the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that

groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink

before the match.    Several other personal radio messages were then

received regarding the same topic.

About 11.20 am Sergeant Goddard carried out radio checks some

personal radios did not reply and the sector Inspectors were asked

to make checks where appropriate.    Throughout this time various

messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the city side of

the ground, Ml motorway, Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.

This indicated that the Nottingham supporters were en route in

numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile

opening time of 12 noon.
Just after noon I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two video

recorders.     The time and date system was checked and set possibly

using the ground lock mounted above the North Stand or by a time

check with other officers in the control box.     The tapes were set

to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30 pm the

same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.    Around this time it was noticed that persons

had entered the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone

Road turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this

was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Some time

between 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings

Lane turnstiles.    This would mean of course that a mixture of fans

would have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.    The complaints were that fans were

drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being

a general nuisance.    Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed

in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by

several police officers.    I set camera 4 to monitor the situation

noticing that several arrests were made and that manpower was

getting low.    I remembered that there had been some trouble at last

years match in the same location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray re the number of officers available for deployment on the
Superintendent Murray then contacted Inspector Sewell regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing

40 men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00 pm Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.    Through the

afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality of

personal radio transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00 pm I overhead on VHF that Liverpool supporters had been

spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.     The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool

fans on a coach registered number 9995 RU.     This number was

circulated and the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around 2.20 pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he

noticed a man on the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.     He dropped

his trousers and began fooling about.     His behaviour was such that

it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.   I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.

About 2.15 pm all the control room staff discussed that it was

apparent the Liveprool fans had not begun to arrive as y e t .   The

North Stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal rate.    Just after this the personal radio

transmissions became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30 pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   I would estimate around 3,000 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal, it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35 pm the civilian radio repair man stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using   the radios on a back to back system.

About   the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield came   to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied 'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.    Sergeant Sorsby despatched 2 horses from

the South Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being   forced, they were bending and buckling.   In     my mind I

believed that the gates referred to were   'C' gate and I kept       the

Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

About 2.40 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent

Murray requested that I contact Operations Room so that a traffic

car with a PA system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

crowd which were by this time Lecoming apparently more hostile.            I

also remember around this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

personal radio telephone style handset and after trying to use it,

threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and the
personal radio transmissions were very poor.     I can remember seeing

about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate        'C'

towards the South Stand.

About 2.40 pm I remember seeing    'C' gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.     I then said words like    'They've

broken down the gate'.     At the same time I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.        After about

20 seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through

the open gate.   I remember seeing mounted officers trying to clear

space in the crowd.

The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to Inspector Sewell and I remember him offering two Serials,

one of which was the   'F' Division Crime and Vandal, they were

directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat

astride gate   'B' with police officers stood below.      I think at this

time a personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and

an officer replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I remember a personal radio message from

Superintendent Marshall to the effect    'We must open the gates or

someone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

Leppings Lane end and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made
enquiries as to the officer's identity.       Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall, his voice was

very distressed,    'You must open the gates, open the gates'.        Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said   'Right if lives are at risk, then open the gates'.      Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted     'Open the gates, open the gates'.    Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind       'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.       Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio     'There are people being crushed

outside   'A' gate we must open 'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings,   in   fact, I believed that at   one time the officers managed

to close the     outer gates, however, the crowd outside forced its      way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via       'C' gate at

least.    I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.      It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.       A short time later fans

were seen to     climb the perimeter track fence.   Officers on the

track seemed     to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.       At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.     No information was coining in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.     Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.   A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted out.    One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.     She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.    By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.   Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.   It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.     Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth, persons were laid across the

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.        It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.        A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.        I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.        Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.        Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.        I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.        It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.     He did not arrive.     The senior fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.   This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.   The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.     I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PC

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.      I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

into the property store and await the arrival of AVA,

         was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made .

About 11.30 pm                  arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.    He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.   I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to                     My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.   I had no contact with

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the bodies.

I am a Police Constable with South Yorkshire Police at present
stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.                I am at the
present time working beat duties on 'B' group but also have
responsibility operating the static video system which is installed
at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield.
On a personal level I have visited Hillsborough Stadium on many
occasions as a spectator standing on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the ground and the Leppings Lane terrace.                I have also
worked in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my
past 8 years service.
In September 1987 I took over duties relating to the video system
working from the Police Control Box and since that time I have
attended a 3 day course in relation to the use of video systems for
Command and Control and as a method of evidence gathering.                   The
original system installed at Hillsborough was laid out as a Command
and Control System giving a basic all round view both inside and
outside the ground.      Whilst I have been involved with the duties
that emphasis has shifted from Command and Control to evidence
gathering and with that end in mind several improvements have been
made the most recent being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
camera, the intention being to move the camera from its present
position attached to the roof of the West Stand bringing it down to

a position just above the turnstiles.       The survey was carried out

using a hand held video camera mounted on the platform of a

hydraulic lift.     Two positions were considered, the first mounted

on a p o l e   at the far most corner of the Leppings Lane turnstiles

the second position just above gate      'B1.   It was decided that the

best position would be above    'B' gate.     This position giving good

all around views along Leppings Lane, to the turnstiles below and

the courtyard at the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.           The system

installer Roger Holdsworth agreed to complete a costing for the

improvements and if the cash was available from the football trust,

he would attempt to install the camera in it's new position in time

for the Semi Final.

Unfortunately the clerical side of this operation could not be

completed quick enough and     the planned m o v e    for the camera was

suspended until the summer     break.

On Saturday 15 April 1989,     I commenced duty at 10 am attending at

the police room at Hillsborough, collecting          the hand held VHS radio

which I used to monitor transmissions via Operations Room.            On this

particular day channel 1     had been designated for all        VHF

transmission relating to     the Semi Final.

After collecting the radio I made my way to the Leppings Lane

terrace where I saw that Roger Holdsworth was working on camera

number 5 which overlooks     the Leppings Lane       terrace pens.    The

picture quality had been     substandard for a       number of weeks and Mr

Holdsworth was carrying out some last minute alterations to upgrade

the picture.     After he had completed the work the picture was
indeed better than it had been although not up to the correct

standard-    I then made my way to the Control Box where I met with

Sergeant Goddard and PC Ryan.    After a brief conversation I began

to check the video system operating each of the five cameras in

turn.   We were later joined by Superintendent Murray and it was

agreed between us that Sergeant Goddard would operate the personal

radio, PC Ryan the tannoy and telephone and I in addition to my

duties as camera operator would monitor the VHF set using it if

necessary.    These duties were no different to what would be carried

out on a normal match day.

Around 10.55 am that date, Superintendent Chapman contact control

regarding a group of Liverpool supporters who were waiting outside

the 5 Arches public house.    There was at this time no trouble but

the information was passed just so that officer could be aware that

groups of supporters had arrived and were intent on getting a drink

before the match.    Several other personal radio messages were then

received regarding the same topic.

About 11.20 am Sergeant Goddard carried out radio checks some

personal radios did not reply and the sector Inspectors were asked

to make checks where appropriate.    Throughout this time various

messages were coming in regarding traffic problems the city side of

the ground, Ml motorway, Parkway, etc, diversions were in force.

This indicated that the Nottingham supporters were en route in

numbers and could be expected at the ground for the turnstile

opening time of 12 noon.
Just after noon I inserted the 2 VHS video tapes in the two video

recorders.     The time and date system was checked and set possibly

using the ground lock mounted above the North Stand or by a time

check with other officers in the control box.     The tapes were set

to run at normal speed, my intention being that around 2.30 pm the

same date I would inset 2 new tapes which would then include the

build up to the match throughout the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.    Around this time it was noticed that persons

had entered the ground.

A short time later it was discovered that some of the Penistone

Road turnstiles were not manned due to an administrative error this

was corrected by deploying one of the spare serials.     Some time

between 1.00 pm and 2.30 pm there was concern expressed regarding

the Liverpool fans purchasing Kop tickets from touts at Leppings

Lane turnstiles.     This would mean of course that a mixture of fans

would have to be supervised within the Kop terrace.

During this same period problems began arising in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to mind were the Horse

and Jockey and the Royal.     The complaints were that fans were

drinking heavily out on the street, urinating in gardens and being

a general nuisance.     Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 pm I began

to notice that on the Kop several Liverpool fans had been placed

in the triangle area near to the North Stand end supervised by

several police officers.     I set camera 4 to monitor the situation

noticing that several arrests were made and that manpower was

getting low.    I remembered that there had been some trouble at last

years match in the same location and I questioned Superintendent

Murray re the number of officers available for deployment on the

Kop.
Superintendent Murray then contacted Inspector Sewell regarding the

manpower situation and he confirmed that 2 coaches each containing

40 men would be on standby in Penistone Road.

Around 2.00 pm Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield went to speak to the match referee.     Through the

afternoon complaints had been expressed regarding the quality of

personal radio transmissions to the control staff.

Around 2.00 pm I overhead on VHF that Liverpool supporters had been

spoken to on a coach which had displayed a Nottingham Forest

supporters parking ticket.     The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traffic officers and advised.

About the same time there was a report of troublesome Liverpool

fans on a coach registered number 9995 RU.     This number was

circulated and the coach was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around 2.20 pm the ACC Jackson was in the control box when he

noticed a man on the Leppings Lane terrace south pen.     He dropped

his trousers and began fooling about.     His behaviour was such that

it was believed that he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be done about him.   I set the camera to monitor his behaviour.

About 2.15 pm all the control room staff discussed that it was

apparent the Liveprool fans had not begun to arrive as y e t .    The

North Stand had vast spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a normal rate.    Just after this the personal radio

transmissions became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.
About 2.30 pm my attention was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   I would estimate around 3,000 people and

it was apparent that the number was increasing by the volume of

foot passengers in Leppings Lane itself.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked about the large crowd and it

was said that although it was more than normal, it was no more than

was expected for such a football match.

About 2.35 pm the civilian radio repair man stated that he could

not fix the personal radio system and it was necessary to resort to

using the radios on a back to back system.

About the same time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield     came to the

back of the control box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

Leppings Lane were being recorded and I replied    'Yes'.

A personal radio on Leppings Lane requested more manpower to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.   Sergeant Sorsby despatched 2 horses from

the South Stand car park.

A personal radio message then came in stating that the gates were

being forced, they were bending and buckling.     In   my mind I

believed that the gates referred to were   'C' gate    and I kept the

Leppings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

About 2.40 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent

Murray requested that I contact Operations Room so that a traffic

car with a PA system could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

crowd which were by this time becoming apparently more hostile.         I

also remember around this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

personal radio telephone style handset and after trying to use it,

threw it down onto the desk because it was not working and the
personal radio transmissions were very poor.      I can remember seeing

about 5 or 6 officers stood on barrier duty just past the gate      'C'

towards the South Stand.

About 2.40 pm I remember seeing 'C' gate open and a number of

supporters enter the ground.      I then said words like 'They've

broken down the ga t e 1.   At the same time I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.      After about

20 seconds I noticed that the gate was closed and it seemed that a

mounted officer alone had prevented a big rush of people through

the open gate.    I remember seeing mounted officers trying to clear

space in the crowd.

The request for additional officers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

made to Inspector Sewell and I remember him offering two Serials,

one of which was the    'F' Division Crime and Vandal, they were

directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I saw Liverpool fans climbing the walls of the ground onto the

turnstile roofs and I in particular remember several being sat

astride gate 'B' with police officers stood below.      I think at this

time a personal radio message was sent regarding the climbers and

an officer replied that he could not reach them.

Around 2.45 pm I remember a personal radio message from

Superintendent Marshall to the effect     'We must open the gates or

someone is going to be killed, please open the gates.'

At this time Chief Inspector McRobbie is in the control box wearing

civilian clothing.

I remember seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

Leppings Lane end and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield made
enquiries as to the officer's identity.      Another personal radio

message was received from Superintendent Marshall, his voice was

very distressed,   'You must open the gates, open the gates'.     Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield seemed to pause for thought and then

said 'Right if lives are at risk, then open the gates'.       Sergeant

Goddard then transmitted 'Open the gates, open the gates'.       Just

prior to this I remember seeing officers behind 'A' gate, they were

set out in two lines forming a funnel.       Sergeant Higgins of 'F' C&V

transmitted on personal radio 'There are people being crushed

outside   'A' gate we must open 'A' gate'.

I remember that about the time the gates were ordered to be opened

mounted officers outside Leppings Lane turnstiles had managed to

create a void between the turnstiles and the outer perimeter

railings, in fact, I believed that at one time the officers managed

to close the outer gates, however, the crowd outside forced its way

through the outer gates and ran into the ground via      'C' gate at

least.    I remember seeing crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terrace just behind the turnstiles, they were just stood about not

doing anything in particular.

About 2.55 pm Chief Superintendent Duckenfield told control room

staff to get some manpower to the North Stand to stop any possible

rush onto the pitch.    It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool fans climbing up into the West Stand from the terrace

area. They were assisted by people in the stand and the same

problem had occurred the previous year.      A short time later fans

were seen to climb the perimeter track fence.      Officers on the

track seemed to be telling the fans to get down from the fence.          At
this point the staff in the control box and I thought that the

situation was purely public order.      No information was coming in to

the effect that people were getting hurt.

A crowd gathered on the perimeter track and Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield ordered that they should be moved as quickly as

possible to the wing sections of Leppings Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was space.      Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield was angry about officers stood around the track near to

the Kop and the North Stand.     A personal radio message was sent to

the officers and they were directed to the front of the North

Stand. Around this time Chief Inspector McRobbie was sent to the

pitch to get things sorted o u t .   One problem was a WPC stood on the

perimeter track just below the control box.      She did not appear to

be moving people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

perimeter gate to the track then walked off leaving the gate open.

Chief Inspector McRobbie took charge of the policewoman and began

ushering people from the track.      By this time there were people on

the pitch and the perimeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.     Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the problem was more than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the match was stopped ACC Jackson was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact Operations Room and call operation

support.     It was at this point that I decided to concentrate on

operating the VHF radio rather than the camera system.     Very

suddenly it became apparent that there were injuries and at that

time I contacted Operations Room for ambulances to be sent to the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.     There were people all over the
pitch in front of the goal mouth,    persons were laid across the

floor with persons giving mouth to mouth.       It was only then that we

began to feel that there might be deaths.       A personal radio message

was sent to control asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Goddard

contacted Claywheels Lane asking if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.     The reply was negative.   He turned to me and I told

him that I would contact the fire service which I did via

Operations Room.     I made it clear that we required cutting

equipment for the metal fences.     I remember someone instructing PC

Ryan to use the tannoy telling people to stay calm.       I can remember

seeing bodies being moved towards the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

terrace from the centre pens.     I believe that it was police

officers who were moving the bodies from the area.      Liverpool fans

who were on the pitch started to run towards the Kop.      Officers

managed to stop the charge and split up several groups of fans who

were fighting.     A line of officers were then formed across the

pitch just the Kop side of the centre line.      I recall the fire

service arriving at Leppings Lane and their men running onto the

pitch.   I then sent a message to Operations that we did have

fatalities at the ground although when I sent this message no

details had been passed by personal radio.      It was all done from

observation.     Further contact from Operations Room regarding the

number of ambulance required and they said would it be more than 20

and I said something to the effect that we need as many as

possible.

Traffic motor cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

hospitals and I made a request for the senior ambulance officer to

attend the control box.    He did not arrive.    The senior fire
officer attended at the control box and liaised with senior

officers and he too asked to speak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another request was made for that officer to attend the control box

via Operations Room.

About 3.35 pm I checked the video tapes and discovered that one had

stopped and the second had been switched to operate in the 18 hour

mode which in effect speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.   This I can only think was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the video control area.   The videos are set at knee

height and I believe that as I leant forward this is how I altered

the time mode setting.

I installed two new tapes and set them running at normal speed.

Mr Clough and Mr Dalgleish entered the control box and offered

their services once they had established that the match was off.

Mr Dalgleish wanted to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

the tannoy system in the DJs control box below the police control.

Superintendent Murray then later asked for details of transport so

that preparations could be made for emptying the ground.     I

remember some time after this Superintendent Murray saying to PG

Ryan that he wanted a message passing over the tannoy telling the

Liverpool fans to stay calm and remain where they were until the

ambulances had left the Stadium.

Sometime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 pm I removed

the video tapes and made my way to the gym to offer assistance.      I

was later sent to HQ with the video tapes and I there saw Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, Sergeant Booth, ACC Jackson and Chief

Superintendent Denton.

About 11.00 Detective Superintendent McKay attended and he
instructed me to return to Hammerton Road, book the video tapes

iii-o the property store and await the arrival of AVA,

         was to attend so that copies of the video tapes could be

made.

About 11.30 pm                  arrived at Hammerton Road Police

Station and I explained the faults on the video tapes.    He asked if

I could get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

setting so that he could transfer the tape action at the correct

speed.   I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders from the police control box taking it to Ecclesfield

Training School where I handed it to                     My immediate

supervisor would be Superintendent Murray.   I had no contact with

the fans before/during or after the incident.   I cannot relate any

information regarding the stewarding of the ground and I had no

contact with the bodies.

These 4 pages are not complete but are just a resume of the main

points of the day.

James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident         &    Emergency

Department at the Northern General-Hospital,            Sheffield.     I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 M ay 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,      Sheffield.     I qualified in

                       in 19     and m y qualifications are




The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a bus y one.                  It

had 55,000 patients last year,       of which 42,000 were new

patients.   In terms of medical staffing,        there are seven

Senior House Officers,    an A s s oc i at e Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fracture Clinic)         and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.     I am the first on call,         except every

other wee k en d w hen one of the Orthopaedic Consultants takes

the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department,           especially

in the afternoon.     On Saturday,   15 April there were two

medical staff,   of SHO grade,   on d uty and I was on call.           I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the m o r n i n g of

the 15th.   The Department was fairly busy.        At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out for the afternoon as I planned to take my
family to the park.     I ascertained the wai ti n g time in the

Department was two hours, which means it was quite busy.               I

took m y wife and children to               |.   We were just

returning,   and were about 200 yards from our home in

          , when m y bleep which I had been carrying went off.

I arrived home within about a minute and telephoned the

hospital immediately.     I spoke to Charge Nurse Batty, who

indicated he had been notified of some sort of incident at

Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand by and to

expect to receive some crush injuries.      He gave no indication

of numbers or that a major incident had been called.          He

indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.     I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in m y car.      The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.          The

journey was very quick as the roads were quiet and I arrived

at the hospital at 3.35 pm, acco rd i ng to the car clock.         I

parked my car in the Consultants'    car park.    I started

walking towards the Department,    but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.       I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Batty w ho informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.       I asked him

whether he had implemented the M a jo r Disaster Plan and he
replied he had.     It was obvious to me that it was necessary

to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Ro o m where there wer e three

patients, undergoing resuscitation.      One was a ten year old

boy w h o was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.    I gather she had been called when the Department

w ere alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.         A Senior

House O fficer from Rotherham, w h o had just been pass i ng the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was w o r ki n g on the third patient.




More ambulances arrived almost immediately.        I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of wh o m w ere dead or dying.     Some were sent to the

R esuscitation Room and I then w ent to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.        I cannot now

recall how ma n y patients w ere in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm,   to triage patients as the y arrived,   and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Roo m was fairly well manned.      I
allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Ro o m initially,          and

then into W ard 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.



I realised the Resuscitation Roo m was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation

and I therefore sent one of the SHOs, Mr Duncan, to telephone

SYMAS Control and request cases be diver t ed to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

t agging system to identify the casualties.         Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending the dead on arrival

direct to the Plaster Room.        Previously,   I had sent the whole

batch of casualties,    including dead,    into the Resuscitation

Room to attempt resuscitation in vie w of their age.



Also about this time,    I received a request to send a mobile

t eam to the Hillsborough football ground.        The request came

via                            .    i re a lised everyone was ver y

busy and that we could not spare sufficient staff to send a

mobile team immediately and I dec i de d it was more important

to retain the resources within the Department.         However,    by

about 4.00 pm the position had eased such that I was able to

despatch two Doctors with an equipment box,        in an ambulance,
to the football ground.      The staff who went were

______________   SHO, and an Anaesthetic Registrar.      The

Department has a specially p re pared box of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.      As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there w e r e sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors w ere sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became mor e controlled and less

serious injuries w ere arriving in the Department.        These were

sent to the Physio th e ra p y Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.        By about 4.30 pm the

Department was b e co m i n g much quieter.   I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon,      and Dr D Edwards,   Orthopaedic

Registrar,   to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember rece i vi n g arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out
of th e ground.



At the time I did not know how ma n y patients the Department

had received,     although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all un d ergoing resuscitation.      The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation patients and all the beds

were being used.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.      In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.      The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),     16 (Anteroom),   14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room),    57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms)    and cubicles were used.   A n y casualties wh o did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or,   if they were minor casualties,   to the Physiotherapy

Department.     O nly one patient required surgery -

                Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients re quiring resuscitation.       I think this

is due to three factors,    name l y the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site,    the speed of transportation to the
hospital in v i e w of its proxi m it y to the football ground,   and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.         I believe

at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very qui c kl y by the Supplies Department.      The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.     He was t r ansferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.     A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were tr ansferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 p m the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity W i n g Ph y siotherapy Department.    The dead were

transferred to the m o rt u a r y which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.       The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mo r tu a ry which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that,    for example,   those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label,        non-urgent a green
label and dead a wh i te label.     In fact,   because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes,             it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.           This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination,       once triaged.



I only had contact w i t h the families of the patients later in

the evening.   I recall I was in the Control Room w hen one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.           I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.        The families

appeared to be well m a r s h al l ed on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.       I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.       I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.      By the following mor n in g I

was able to calculate that ninety-three patients had been

through the Department,   of wh o m fifty-five were admissions,

twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.        Of the admissions

fifteen were in intensive care,     although by the following

m o r n in g (Monday) that figure had dropped to eleven.   Seven

patients had been t ransferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.      In the two years I have worke d

at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital I have seen only one such

case.   The most common cause of this type of crush injury is
from a car falling on top of someone who is w orking beneath

it.   The Department had approximately twenty-five to thirty

traumatic asphyxia cases in the space of an hour and I

believe handled the incident extremely well.

James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of t h e Accident & Emergency

Department at the Northern G e n e r al Hospital,          Sheffield.     I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,           Sheffield.      I qualified in

                             in 19     and my qualifications are




The A c cident & Emergency D ep a r t m e n t is quite a busy one.           It

had 55,000 patients last year,              of wh ic h 42,000 were new

patients.      In terms of m e d i c al staffing,      there are seven

Senior House Officers,          an A s s o c i a t e Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fract u re Clinic)            and five GP Clinical

A s si s ta n t sessions.     I am the first on call,      except every

other weekend when one of the Ortho pa e di c Consultants takes

the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy d a y for the Department,              especially

in the afternoon.           On Saturday,    15 Ap r il there were two

m edical staff, of SHO grade,         on d u t y and I was on call.      I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.     The Department was        fairly busy.     At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out for the after n oo n as I planned to take my
 family to the park.     I a sc e rt a in e d the w aiting time in the

 Department was two hours, w h i c h means    it was quite busy.           I

 took my wife and children to                   .    we were just

 returning,   and were about 200 yards      fro m our home in

           , when my bleep w hi c h I had bee n carrying went off.

 I arrived home within about a m i n u t e and telephoned the

 hospital immediately.      I spoke to C h ar g e Nurse Batty, who

 indicated he had been notified of some sort of incident at

Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand by and to

expect to receive some crush injuries.          He gave no indication

of numbers or that a major incident had been called.              He

indicated that no patients had yet a r r i v e d and from the

details he gave me I thought per h ap s the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.       I knew the Department was fairly

b usy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in m y car.          The time on

the car clock, which is two minu t es      fast, was 3.25 pm.       The

journey was very quick as the roads w e r e quiet and I arrived

at the hospital at 3.35 pm, a c c o r d i n g to the car clock.        I

parked my car in the Consultants'        car park.    I started

w a l ki n g towards the Department,   but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I b e ga n to run.          I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Ba tt y wh o informed me three

patients were undergoing r e s u s c it a ti o n in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.           I asked him

w hether he had implemented the M a j o r Disas te r Plan and he
 r e p l i e d he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary

to i mplement the Major Disaster Plan.



 I w e n t into the Resuscitation Ro o m where there were three

patients, undergoing resuscitation.         One was a ten year old

b o y w h o was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.       I gather she had been called when the Department

were a l e r t e d to expect a pa e diatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House O f f ic e r from Rotherham,   who had just been passing the

hospital,     was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was w o r k i ng on the third patient.




More ambulances arrived almost immediately.           I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.          Some were sent to the

R e s u s c i t a t i o n Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

m ys e lf to intubate with endotracheal tubes.        I cannot now

recall how man y patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm,    to triage patients as they arrived,       and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.            I
al l o c a t e d Doctors to the R esuscitation Room initially,       and

then into Ward 60 which had been c leared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.



I re a lised the Resuscitation Room was b ec o mi n g very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation

and I therefore sent one of the SHOs, Mr Duncan,              to telephone

SYMAS Control and request cases be di v er t ed to the Royal

Hallam s hi r e Hospital.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

t a g g i ng system to identify the casualties.         Because of the

v olume of patients a r riving staff were unable to use the

c ol oured labels.



At about this time I started sending the dead on arrival

direct to the Plaster Room.            Previously,   I had sent the whole

batch of casualties,        including dead,    into the Resuscitation

R oom to attempt resuscitation in v iew of their age.



A lso about this time,      I received a request to send a mobile

t eam to the Hillsborough football ground.            The request came

via                                .    I r ea l is e d everyone was very

b u s y and that we could not spare sufficient staff to send a

m o bile team immediately and I decided it was more important

to retain the resources within the Department.              However, by

about 4.00 pm the position had eased such that I was able to

despatch two Doctors with an equipment box,            in an ambulance,
 to the football ground.      The staff who went were

_______________ SHO, and an An a es t he t ic Registrar.   The

 Department has a specially pr e p a r e d box of equipment for just

 such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.       As it transpired,    when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

 staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were r e c ei v in g about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation b e came more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.           These were

sent to the Physiotherapy De p artment which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requ i ri n g minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.        By about 4.30 pm the

Department was b e co m i n g much quieter.    I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon,       and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar,   to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist,         was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember r ec e i v i n g arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out
 of t h e g r o u n d .



At the time I did not kno w h ow ma n y patients the Department

 had received,            although I k n e w at one point that about sixteen

patients were all u n d e r go i ng resuscitation.              The Department

 is set up for ten re s us c it a ti o n patients and all the beds

were being used.



The triage area was es t ab l is h ed near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.              In a m a j o r disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.                   The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),                16   (Anteroom),   14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room),             57,   58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms)     and cubicles were used.              A ny casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or,      if they were minor casualties,             to the Physiotherapy

Department.          Only one p a t i e n t required surgery -

                    Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients r e q u i r i n g resuscitation.            I think this

is due to three factors,               n am e ly the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site,               the speed of transportation to the
hospital in view of its p r o x i m i t y to the football ground,      and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.              I believe

at one time we ran out of o xygen flow meters,           but these were

p ro v id e d very quickly by the Supplies Department.         The

hospital does not have a CT scanner a n d one of the

ve nt ilated casualties r eq u ir e d a CT scan during the

afternoon.     He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.     A further two patients w e r e transferred during the

e vening and four patients wer e t ra n sf e rr e d during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were di r ec t ed to the General and

M ate r ni t y W ing Physiotherapy Department.      The dead were

transferred to the mortuary whi c h had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.         The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary m o r t u a r y which was established

at the football ground.



The M aj o r Disaster Plan provides     for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that,    for example,   those r e q u i r i n g immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label,       those r e qu i ri n g urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label,          non-urgent a green
 label and dead a white label.           In fact,   because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes,                  it

was impossible for staff to use the co l oured labels.              This

did not make any material di f fe r en c e as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients'          destination,   once triaged.



I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.        I recall I was in the Control Room when one

w om a n arrived trying to find her h u s ba n d and daughter.        I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.             The families

appeared to be well m a rs halled on Level C, which is the floor

b e l o w the A & E Department.       I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.            I th i nk there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.           By the following morning I

was able to calculate that ninety-three patients had been

through the Department,         of whom f i ft y-five were admissions,

twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.             Of the admissions

fifteen were in intensive care,          although by the following

m o r n i n g (Monday)   that figure had dro p pe d to eleven.   Seven

patients had been transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                In a further
three patients there us some evidence that the patients may have received some
resuscitation attempts.                 In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
and it is likely that these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
at the Accident and Emergency Department.


I feel it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.        Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy_injury.                                _There. are a _
number of well documented instances where large numbers of people have died _
in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                           Such events are fortunately _
rare.          The Northern General Hospital; Accident .and.                                            .. I-

                        STATEMENT



James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident & Emergency

Department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.             I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,    Sheffield.    I qualified in

MB.CHB (Edinburgh University)in 1978 and my qualifications

are B.SC (Med Sci), MB.CHB, FRCS (Edinburgh)      (General Surgery),

FRCS (Edinburgh)    (Accident and Emergency Medicine and Surgery),

FRCS (England)   (General Surgery).


The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.                It

had 55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 were new

patients.   In terms of medical staffing, there are seven

Senior House Officers, an Associate Specialist (six sessions

A & E, four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.     I am permanently the first on call,

except every other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic

Consultants takes the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department, especially

in the afternoon.     On Saturday,   15 April there were two

medical staff, of SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.             I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.   The Department was fairly busy.     At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out as I planned to take my family to the park.
I ascertained the waiting time in the Department was two hours

which means it was quite busy.    I took my wife and children

to                We were just returning, and were about 200

yards from our home in            , when my bleep which I had

been carrying went off.   I arrived home within about a minute

and telephoned the hospital immediately.    I spoke to Charge

Nurse Batty, who indicated he had been notified of some sort

of incident at Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand

by and to expect to receive some crush injuries.        He gave no

indication of numbers or that a major incident had been called

He indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.   I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.      The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.        (ie

the correct time was 3.23 pm).    The journey was very quick as

the roads were quiet and I arrived at the hospital at 3.35 pm,

(the correct time was 3.33 pm) according to the car clock.           I

parked my car in the Consultants' car park.      I started

walking towards the Department, but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.        I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse Batty who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.      I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he

replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it   w as   necessary
to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.   One was a teenager

who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.



More ambulances arrived almost immediately.    I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse Batty to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.   Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.    I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch   of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived, and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I

allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially, and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.
I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation.

I therefore requested the Ambulance Liaison Officer to divert

cases to the Hallamshire.     I believe that Mr Duncan, Senior

Registrar in Surgery, also telephoned SYMAS at that time with

the same request.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.     Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending patients arriving with

no cardiac output direct to the Plaster Room (mortuary).        Up

to that point patients with no cardiac output who were having

active cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance were sent

to the Resuscitation Room to continue resuscitation, in view of

their age and the nature of the injury.



Also about this time I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.     The request came

to me by word of mouth but I believe that the call originated

over the direct line to the Accident & Emergency Department

from SYMAS Headquarters.     At that time there was a large number

of seriously ill patients in the Department with not sufficient

medical staff.     However, very quickly more staff arrived and I

was able to despatch two Doctors with the Major Accident

Equipment Boxes.    The staff who went were Dr Davidson, Senior

House Officer, and an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer.     The
Department has specially prepared boxes of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.     These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.     By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.     I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out

of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department
had received, although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.     The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation points and all these points

were being used with often more than one patient to each point.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.   In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.     The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),    16 (Anteroom), 14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room), 57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.    Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or, if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.   Only one patient required surgery -

              Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.     I think this

is due to three factors, namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site, the speed of transportation to the

hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground, and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.     I believe
 at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.      The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.    He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.    A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.    The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.    The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example, those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label, non-urgent a green

label and dead a white label.   In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes, it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.     This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination, once triaged.
I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.     I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.      I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.     The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.    I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.     I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.     By the following morning I

was able to calculate that eighty-eight patients had been

through the Department from Hillsborough.     Fifty-five of these

were admissions, twenty-one were discharged to home after

treatment and twelve patients were dead.     During the time of

the alert, the Department also dealt with five other patients

who were not from Hillsborough.     Of the admissions, fifteen

were admitted to Intensive Care and two further ventilated

patients were transferred to the Hallamshire Hospital.      Later

that evening a further five patients were transferred to the

Hallamshire Hospital for CT scanning.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.     In the two years I have worked

at the Northern General Hospital I have only seen one such

case.    The most common cause of this type of injury is a car

falling on top of someone working beneath it, or from heavy

industry.    The Northern General Hospital treated twenty-five

cases of severe traumatic asphyxia in the space of one hour and

I believe it handled the incident extremely well.

                                   My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).                                                                                                                            I have been

                                   in active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

                                   Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

                                   Midlands for twenty-five of those years.                                                                                         During that time I have performed more

                                   than twenty-six .thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty’s coroners and

                                   have taken part in some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.



                                   I have been asked by Mr Mervyn JONES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

                                   Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry Team, to provide a general

                                   overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

                                   ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 19-

                                   during a cup semi-final match.



                                   I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

                                   request of Her Majesty’s coroner at Hillsborough Stadium.on the evening of 15

                                   April, 1989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and'.Monday,' 17;

                                   - following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary.in' the
gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.        Initially, I believe,

some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General Hospital

in Sheffield, but later they were removed from there and brought to the

Medico-Legal Centre.     As far as I know, the only body autopsied at the Northern

General Hospital was that of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who

survived, under treatment, until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body

was examined that same day by Dr Shirley HOLT, Consultant Pathologist at the

Northern General Hospital, Herries Road,       Sheffield, S5 7AU   (Tel: 0742 -

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

personally carried out.    However, having read all ninety-five post mortem

reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses, I believe I can speak in

a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total

of ninety-five cases which were examined.      The details of individual cases will

need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their

names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been

provided above.
Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,

in my view, merely reflects the nature of the occasion.



AGE

Of the ninety-five who died, the youngest was a 10 year old boy and the eldest a

67 year old man.

  Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years of age

  Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age

  Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and 39 years of age

  Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.

  Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average

soccer crowd.



CAUSE OF DEATH

In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

barriers.   In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.



Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

and mouth (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

(strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by
 a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move

 in and out to enable the person to draw breath.     Whatever the impedance to

 respiration, the result is similar.     The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into

 the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

 require it for their normal function.    The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

 turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.

The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the internal organs.      Thus, a

somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

If the impediment to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -

perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then life

is no longer possible.



Appearances such as these were seen in almost every person who died at

Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed solely to traumatic

(or crush) asphyxia.     In one case         the force compressing the chest was

(perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta

between them so that the man bled to death internally before he could be

asphyxiated.   In only eight other cases (Nos I

were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of

trauma to the chest, neck or head.     In the remaining two cases (I         only,
 truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory factor in

 the death.



INHALATION OF VOMIT

In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be

aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death.     Most

pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and

though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a

separate heading in the cause of death.     This is my view and the one I have

adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.     It has, however, to

be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

oo occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

hard external mechanical compression.     Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

those persons intoxicated with alcohol.



OTHER INJURIES

In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in

three cases (                 - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when

they sustained that injury.



In only two cases were long bones fractured.    In one of these cases (^^, both

bones in a          forearm were broken and in one                     bemur was

broken.   Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental

trampling.




                                      - 6 -
In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive

bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest

(pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim's breathing.



In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation

of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a significant factor in the

death.



As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore

superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

the post mortem (see above).



ALCOHOL

In discussing this matter, my impression is that the dead came mostly from the

front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood

alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the

interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.

No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.

Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have
nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more

than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood.      Six youths below the age of

18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol of 141 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a

blood alcohol of 56 mg%.



EYE HAEMORRHAGES

I have been asked to comment on the proposition that a distinction can be made

in this case between those persons who died from traumatic asphyxia standing up

in the crowd and those dying from the same cause lying down.      The latter, it is

said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the former will not.

I have seen a very large number of cases of traumatic asphyxia and I am certain

that no such distinction can be made - both groups will in all probability have

petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.



GENERAL COMMENT

The Hillsborough disaster occurred between 3 pm and 3.30 pm on Saturday, 15

April, 1989*     By 2 pm on Monday, 17 April, ie less than forty-eight hours later,

all ninety-four of the victims who were then dead had been examined post mortem

and had a blood sample taken for analysis, so that their bodies were ready for

release to relatives.     I believe that several factors were responsible for this

feat:-



  1.     The excellence of Her Majesty's Coroner's arrangements and organisation.

 2.      The immediate availability of the Football Club's gymnasium, sited just a

         few yards from the pitch.   This huge room was easily compartmentalised

         into three large chambers, each invisible from the others.   One was used
  as a mortuary for temporary body storage, one as a makeshift canteen and

  the third as a reception area for relatives where they were greeted and

  assisted by padres of various denominations, social workers and

  ancillaries.

  The fact that the victims' bodies were not fragmented nor greatly

  disfigured as might have happened in an explosion or an aircraft crash.

  This meant that the initial identification was possible from polaroid

  photographs taken by the police, which made the identification process

  rapid and meant that relatives were generally required to view only one

  body and were spared the harrowing task of entering the main mortuary and

  searching for their dead.

  The use of the facilities available at the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre -

  the only building of its kind in the United Kingdom.   This meant that in

  one day it was possible for up to six teams of pathologists and their

  assistants to work simultaneously in excellent conditions with modern

  equipment so that they were able to perform seventy autopsies on Sunday

  alone.   This building was designed with an emergency facility to deal with

  disaster involving up to one hundred bodies, and when the disaster

  arrived, the building worked well.   Sheffield City Council are to be

  congratulated on their provision of such a building.

                                             By THE CORONER:

                        Q. Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
                           names, qualifications and appointment? - A. Ernest John
                           Wallace Gumpert.   I am a Bachelor of Medicine of the
                    B      University at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
                           University of Cambridge.   A Member of the Royal
                           College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal College
                           of Physicians of London.   I am consulting clinical
                           neuro physiologist and consulting neurologist to the
                           Sheffield Area Health Authority, Teaching.

                        Q. Dr. Gumpert, although you are a Sheffield man
                           professionally, I dragged you back from Cambridge
                           today? - A. Yes, sir.

                        0. Where I tracked you down!   I very much appreciate the
                           fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
                           to be here.   Thank you very much.   Dr. Gumpert, you,
                           of course, had nothing whatever to do with this case.
                    D      I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
                           following Hillsborough and indeed you may well know one
                           or two people I will be referring to later, but this
                           particular case was not one you came across.   You have
                           heard the evidence which has been put regarding this
                           young man.   What I would like you to do now is to give
                           us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
                           instance and then we will try and relate it to this
                    E      young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
                           relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
                           became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
                           kidney transplantations, it became very important that
                           the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
                           usually in accidents, could be increased because the
                           life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
                           completely different to the life of a patient who has
                           to have dialysis three times a week.   They can go back
                           to normal life.

                           A hypothesis of b rain death was then discussed, agreed
                           and published,    This consisted of certain examinations
                           of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
                           brain stem.    If you imagine the brain as being like a
                           walnut, and it is , it is like having a carrot stuck
                    G      underneath the wa lnut, and it is the carrot that
                           matters.    This i s where blood pressure, pulse,
                           respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
                           controlled.    One e this part of the brain is dead, and
                           this death occurs , as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
                           between four and six minutes after deprivation of
                           oxygen, then the person is going to die.     They can be

                           kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
                           remember the case in America which was kept alive for
                           thirteen and a half years.

                           Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
                           drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
                           call for them to be repeated after a passage of time.
                    n     Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
                    "     BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o'clock when
                           the medical profession for once actually debated it,
                           eight of us.    As a result of that debate the
                           regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
                           by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
                           to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcome from my
                           personal point of view, although I don't know whether
                           the anguish was worth it really.

                           As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
                           years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
                           procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
                           duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
                           dead without being disturbed by it still.

                    D      From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
                           experience of brain death and brain damage.   It seems
                           clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
                           probably dead before he was got out of the area in
                           which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
                           I would think consciousness was lost probably within
                           ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
                           instantaneous - not quite, but almost.
                    E
                            I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
                            "convulsion" because to me a convulsion is a major
                            epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
                            not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.   I
                            think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
                            means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
                            any significant movement.

                            Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
                            can tv/itch and very unnerving it is too.   This is
                            really due to a spinal reflex.   What we think happens
                            in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
                            dies first.    The cortex, that is the thinking part of
                            the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
                            longer and the peripheral nervous system probably quite
                    **      a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
                            what has been described by the Liverpool officer.

                         Q. I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
                            statement when he was discussing the question of a
                            pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
                            hypothesise that in fact he wasn't
                                                            '*■ and he had
                                                                       u "'' felt a

                          pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
                          would that fit in with your understanding...   Is that
                          a possibility? - A. It is a possibility, sir.   I would
                          like just to observe that feeling the carotid pulse is
                          quite difficult in somebody who has got a low blood
                          pressure, as would have been here.   In fact it can be
                          so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
                          electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
                    B     stopped or not.

                          I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
                          I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
                          house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
                          Brock at Guy's Hospital.   That was in the days when we
                          did open cardiac massage.   In other words, if somebody
                          died you opened their chest and you massaged their
                          heart between your hands.   A terrifying experience.
                          It was while I was working for him that one day three
                          of us were doing it one morning, that he stopped it,
                          and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
                          Even to somebody like me who has been doing it for
                          twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.    The
                          last time I tried to do it I failed completely.    Even
                    D     to a trained person it is difficult.   Indeed, when
                          junior doctors are examined for this now, as they are,
                          a significant number fail rather than pass.    It is
                          quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
                          incredibly difficult.

                        0. You heard Dr. Slater's account of death, shall we say.
                           Would you go along with that? - A. I thought it was
                    E      eloquent.   I felt quite nervous!

                        0. You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
                           loss of pain and I think you distinguish slightly
                           there.  Can you give me any idea that if a person
                           becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
                           can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
                           Slater put it very clearly.   You all read in the
                           newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
                           had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being
                           able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
                           the operation.   Again I have experienced this at first
                           hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
                           often very important not to depress the state of
                           consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
                           anyhow.   When we used to resuscitate the patients we
                    G      used to give them an electric shock.   Lord Brock used
                           to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."   The patient
                           would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
                           were.   Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
                           else?" and they didn't, so it is all very much a
                           question of degree.

                          I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
                          unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
                          the compression and two because of the asphyxia and
                          three because as Dr. Slater again explained everything
                          is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
                          moving around, it would have been very quick, almost as
                          quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.

                    B          THE CORONER:      Mr. Fraser?

                                MR. FRASER:     No questions, sir.

                                       Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

                        Q. Dr. Guinpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
                           very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
                           deep unconsciousness.    Following deep unconsciousness,
                           do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
                           Either may occur.   There is no particular rule.   The
                           thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
                           close the dead person's eyes.    I don't think I have
                           had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
                           Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
                    D      eyes shut.

                        Q. Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
                           feeling any pain or discomfort.   Is then the face of
                           the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of
                           grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing
                           pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

                    E   0. Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
                           Not in iny view.

                        0. Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
                           the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
                           of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
                           thereafter brain death?

                                THE CORONER:     Could you repeat that question?

                                MR. LIMB:   I am referring back to the process, or
                           the sequences of events as outlined by Dr. Slater, sir.
                           Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
                           thereafter again brain death.   The nature of my
                           inquiry was as to whether following profound
                           unconsciousness, although there may be no outward
                    G      expressions there is this change that the face becomes
                           discoloured?

                                THE CORONER:     The greyness you are driving at?

                                MR. LIMB:      Sir, that is right.

     THE WITNESS:   Are you asking me to say when I
think the greyness came on or just the way it changed?I
cannot tell you when it came on.   I think probably it
came on during the unconscious stage and I don't think
the face would change when the moment of death came,
total somatic death, I don't think there would be any
change.

     MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whether it happens
following the entry into unconsciousness towards the
next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
I don't think there is a change of facial expression at
the time of brain damage necessarily.   This change of
expression will be a gradually evolving process from
the minute the crush started.

         MR. LIMB:      Thank you, sir.

     THE WITNESS:   Sir, you cannot tell by looking at
a person that they are dead or unconscious, at least I
can't.   You can by feeling them but you can't by
looking at them.

                     Further by THE CORONER:

If a person has been, shall we say, somatically dead
for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
that sometimes the face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
paler, and becomes rigid andtakes on a stare.    Yes,
that is quite different.

         THE CORONER:      Anything else you wanted to ask on
tha t?

         MR. LIMB:      No, thank you, sir.

         MR. CATCHPOLE:      No questions, sir.

     THE CORONER:          Is there anything else we want to
ask Dr. Slater?          (No)

     Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
It is emotive but it is also very interesting.   Is
there anything else while we have two experts here?
You have understood it as far as one is able to
understand it?

         THE FOREMAN:      Yes.

     THE CORONER:   Dr. Gumpert andDr.  Slater, may I
say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b)
difficult subject, succinctly and clearly to all of us
and I very much appreciate your help.   Dr. Slater has
                        had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
                        very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
                        time to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not
                        just to Kevin's family, but to other people who of
                        course are involved in this tragedy as well.   Thank
                        you very much indeed.

                             MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will certainly make sure that
                    B   Kevin's family have the opportunity to see the
                        transcript of what the doctors have said and I am sure
                        they will feel some benefit from that when they feel
                        able to look at it.    Thank you, sir.

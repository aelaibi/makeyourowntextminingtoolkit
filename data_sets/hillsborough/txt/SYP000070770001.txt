PC R o b e r t s       and myself               therefore            remained           in our           positions             until       such a

time    as     we      might        have        been       relieved           by    other          officers.              Whilst          there

it w a s      necessary              to    speak       with        several          fans       who       were       asking          the

turnsile           attendant              to    allow       them        entry       without             tickets,          and       to    turn

them     away.

A    short     ti me        la ter        I heard          two     messages           o ver        the    l ou d     hailer          system

from     the       police          bo;-; r e q u e s t i n g       f ans      at    the       Leppings          Lane          end    of    the

ground        to    stop       pushing.

We    then     began          to     foe a p p r o a c h e d       fay a n u m b e r          of    people          wishing          to    leave

the     ground         and     I went           to    the       corner        of    the       South Stand                to    look       o nto

the     pitch       to      see     what        was    happening.                  There       appeared             to    be a       lar g e

scale       pitch        i n v a s i o n at          the    Leppings           Lane       end       of    the       pitch       with       large

numbers        of      police         officers             present.

Upon     returning             to     the       turnstiles              there       were       still          large       numbers          of

fans     loitering             in     the       South       Stand        car       park       and       1 began          to    h ear
                                                                                                                                          PAGE            :
                                                                                                                                          SI 5 0 3

accounts           from       c lub      stewards              t hat       it w a s        believed          there       may    have          been

deaths        in the L e p p i n g s               Lane        en d    of       the       ground.         I explained               to    the

turnstile           attendant                t hat      we     were        clearly           needed       e 1s e w h e r e     and       would

h ave    to    leave          our       position and                  he a g r e e d         to    close       his     turnstile              early.

Together           w i t h PC R o b e r t s             I then         went          into      the S o u t h        Stand      to    try and

rejoin        our       serial          but       we    were       unable            to    find any          other       members          of       our

serial.

There     s t ill        appeared             to       be a      chaotic             public        order       p r o b l e m at      the

Leppings           Lane       end       of    the       ground         on       the       pitch with           l a rge     numbers            of

police        officers             present             and     I then           saw       people        being        carried        away       from

that     end       of    the       ground across                   the      pitch          towards        the S p i o n        Kop       on

boardings.

1 presumed              at    this       stage          that       the      people           being       carried         may    h ave

sustained           broken             limbs       or       f a i n t e d a n d was           unaware          of    the     serious

nature        of    the       p r o b l e m as          neither            PC    Roberts           nor    myself         had    personal

radios.

In the a b s e n c e              of    the       remainder            of       our       s e r i a l , PC     Roberts         and       myself

joined        other          officers             in f r o n t        of    the       South        Stand       in o r d e r     to       prevent

an    escalation              of       the    pitch          invasion                 I presumed         wasoc cu ri ng         at       the

Leppings           Lane       end       of    the       gro u n d .
                                                                                                                if
I was     then          instructed                by    Inspector               White        to a s s ^ x f jrf'i the          dispersal             of

numerous           Liverpool             fans          on    the      p i t c h wha^ we>^e ge&tipulTaVlng                           at    the

Nottingham              Forest          f ans      in the S o u t h Stand,

The     majority             of    the L i v e r p o o l           fans         on     the p i t c h w i t h         whom      I spoke             were

in a     distressed                and agitated                 state.

Upon     turning             to    look       at       the     growing           number           of    casualties           laying           on    the

p i t c h at       the       corner          of    the       Spion         Hop and           the       North    Stand        I saw        t hat      a

number        of    them were                receiving             heart         massage           from      police        officers            and

St J o h n s       Ambulance             personnel.

Several        hundred             of    the       Liverpool               f ans      ory''ther p i t c h l^then b e g a n               to

                                                                                                                                 SI 5 0 3

           charge         down    the       pitch    t                  e Spion        Kop and       together       with       other

           officers         I formed a                          acros'S— t+re p i t c h       to    prevent       them      getting         to

           the S p i o n Hop.

           Me    then      moved       up    towards       the     Leppings         Lane    end     of    the    ground      in a

           cordon and            remained         somewhere          near      to   the    halfway        line    unt i l   we    were

           instructed            to m i n g l e     with    the L i v e r p o o l      fans    to    tr y a n d    calm      them     down.

           I remained            on   the     pitch       speaking           with   the L i v e r p o o l   fans     u n til     they

           h a d all       been       dispersed          when    I rejoined my             serial        and att ended         in the

           North     Stand        for       a de-briefing.

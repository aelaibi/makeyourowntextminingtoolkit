PRIME MINISTER

HILLSBOROUGH

I   am      not      sure        whether        you     had    a   chance       to        look       at      the
Hillsborough report in last night's box.                             This is attached and if
you    have       time      to    read     it    I     recommend you      take        a    look at           the
conclusions (Flag A) and the recommendations (Flag B ) .


We have        just received the Home Secretary's reactions                                    (see Flag)
and the draft of his                   statement and the Home Office circular in
response to the Report.                       I also attach:


               my minute          of   last      night,       which summarises             the document
         and      gives      a     flavour       of     the    strength     of       its       criticisms
         against the police;


         - a      note    of      today       from     Carolyn     Sinclair          (written         before
         receipt of the Home Secretary's minute) which highlights the
         particular difficulties                      the    report raises for the position
         of    the    police.            Mr     Hurd    is    to minute     you       tomorrow            about
         this.                                                              â€œ


Are you content:


-     for     the    Home      Secretary         to    publish     the   Report           on   Friday            and
without holding a press conference himself but simply issuing a
statement;


         - with the terms of his statement;


              with the circular he proposes to issue?

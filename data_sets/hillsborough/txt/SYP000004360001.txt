               of     considerable           pressure being             exerted on the           concertina gate                nearest

                to our       9 a b in .    Such was        the       pressure       that a couple of ~stewards                    I saw

               were     holding        the      upper    bolts        of the gate          in place.         As        I was   serving

                1   became aware            of a larger          volume       of people moving           past the .cabin-.

               They were         not      running       but o b v i o u j / T y    in a hurry.        I then saw that               the

                c:once
                  i    rtina gates              had been a p g m e d ,

               The     crowd thinned ( m t j &rm the gates were                            shut again.            I cannot        say

                for    how    long the gates were                    open but they were shut well                        before    the

               kick     off.        To my Knowledge              the gates were             not opened again.

               When     the main           crowd    came     in after         the gate was opened some                     people

               stood against              the     Lack wall          rubbing       their    limbs as    if they had been in

               a    confined        situation.

               We stopped selling                  programmes          well       before    3 pm (1500)           but wai ted        in

               the     cabi n till         just after          the kick off to go to the gym n a s i u m with

               our     cash,

               We     left    the    cabin and walked under                       the N or t h Stand.         There were           no

                people m illing around                  that     1    saw,    i mmediately inside the turnstiles,

               a l th ou gn     I was aware          of a cons 1 c.ierable nyrffiber of               people            outside

               waiting        to get        in.

                I had been          in the        g y m nasium only a short                time when the extra;

                eol i cetiien that where             there were           called out a n d shortly after that we

               were     asked to clear              the area          to make way for           the   injured            people.

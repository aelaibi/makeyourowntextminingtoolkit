                On S a t ur da y        15th April         1J7B9 , I a t t e n d e d the F .A Cu p Semi                final

                One       of these        friends,       had sold me a st^hd ticket                    for      the L e p p i n g s

                Lane S t a n d         (cost £12          seated area)

                On     the way to S h ef fi el d we e x p e ri en ce d a slight                       delay       in M a n c h e s t e r

                due to           road works.           I t h i n / en route         to the game we stop p e d at                  the

                Silver Fox             pub at Sto cksi/r i d g e .           In there           I consumed      three     pints        of
                                                                                                             PAGE

lager,      and outside        in the      car    I ate    some    s andwiches         I had bought wit h

me.     In the       pub I swapped my stand ticket wit h a lad                          I got      talking

to.     In return       I got a L e p p i ng s Lane          standing      ticket      value £ 6 » 00p

a nd £ 5 . 0 0   cash.

In all      the time      I was       in this     pub,    I did    not see a n y b o d y who a p p e a r e d

drunk.       Most     people were         having     sandw i c h e s    or a meal      and one          or     two

drinks      just.

W he n we    left the      pub at about           1400 h/'s , we e x p e r i e n c e d      normal       delays

in the      traffic due to            lots of     peop/e     going      to the match.             Also       the

P o l i c e were     stopping all         the    c o a c h e s and mini-buses,          but the         cars

were    not stopped.          We      f i na*l ly /arrived     in Shef f i e 3.d at about            1430 hrs

and    parked      in tlarion R d,        opposite S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y s    t r a ining        ground

We    then wa l k e d the     rest      of the     j o u r n e y , down liiddlewood Rd a n d turned

left    into L e p pings Lane.             On the way Jro the            ground we         received          no

d i r e c t i o n s from Po l i c e    or S t e w a r d s / a nd we f o l l o w e d the steady           st r e a m

of    people.        There was a goodiat triosphere,               and a sense         of e x c i t e m e n t          at

the    prospect       of the m at c h to         come.

I a r r i v e d at    the L e p p i n g s Lane     entran^i at          1440 h r s .       Outside       the

g round     there was      no form of queueigq,               just a melee         of people            perhaps

2.,00 0 - 3 , 0 0 0 .     In amongs t        these/people         there were       two      policemen             on

h o r s e b a c k , shouting,      "Get B a c k / Pus h Ba c k , "       to the    crowd.          These were

the only P o l i ce me n       I saw.        I did not see any s tewards.

Because      of the huge        crowd at the entrance                  I was   stuck       betw e e n    two

t u rnstiles       for about 30 seconds.                 I then /managed to get               through a

t u r n s t i le somehow,     where       I had my t i c k f t     c h e ck e d and     I was a l l o w e d

into    the ground.          I did not          see any sfates being opened,                  I only saw

people      coming through            the turnstile's.

Once    inside       the ground all          I could see was a t u n n e 1 and                I he aded           for

that along with everyone                  else.      At about      halfway along            the    tunnel          I

could see the           pitch and       could see Bruce G r o b e l a a r , in the                gr o u n d      in
                                                                                                                            PAG E          3
                                                                                                                            571

         the goal          mouth,       I could not see any Pol i c e                  officers        or s t e w a r ds      in

         this       area at all.                                        /’

         At the end of the                tunnel      I went

         that whe n         I got to the           end of the tunnnel              that       it was all         one    large

E v e n t u a l l y A was aware           that    I was    off    the    barrier and was m o v e d by the

flow    of the      crowd,        forwar d       to the fencing          onto    the    pitch,         I remember

as    I m o v ed forward         t ha t/ p e o p l e were       lying    on the     floor,       whether       they

were    alive     or dead         I arannot say.          The    next thing       I knew       I was     up against

the    fencing at the            wont        at the very bo t t o m of the              pen,     leading       to

the    pitch,     I t riea to            climb a fence w i t h small             chain links           but was

unable     to get up.             I then saw there              fencing    to my       1 ef/ w i t h    larger

chain    links      I m oved         to my    left and m a n a g e d       to g e t o ws r this          f e n c.i n g

after    being hit          in the        face   twice     by      other fans alao           trying       to get over,

Eventually        I got to the top,                 somehow and         paused    to try and get              some air

I m a na ge d to throw one                leg over the          top a n d felt myself            falling       off       the

fence    towards        the     pitch.        I remember         being    prepared to hit              the    floor       on

that    side,     I was       just       rel ieved    to be out.          As    it was a man wit h a

L i v erpool    accent        caught me and           broke my fall.            This man s u p p o r t e d me and

half    dra gged me onto                the grass    of the       pitch,       where    I lay down           in the

penalty ar e a . A few P o l i c e m e n and              loads     of fans      came up to me and a s k e d

was    I alright,         had    I bro k e n a n y t h i m g .      I remember         looking at        the main

clock between the S pi on Kop and/ t h e S o u t h S t a n d and                          remember       noticing

that    it was      1545 h r s and           I tryfiught it was h a lf-time

After a few minutes                  some    fans    put me      onto an a d v e r t i s i n g    board and

carried me to the N o r t h S t a n d at the                       S p i o n Hop e pfd. After about

the time,       I was       carried         on the    board to an area on the east                      side     of

the north stand.                After another          period of wait i n g

    At    no time   during       the    day of the m a t ch did       I saw a steward            or

    a ny b o d y that    I could       recognise as a steward,           even on the

    pitch after         the disaster.

    The Police at the            front    of the     pens   se e m e d very slow to

    unde r stand what          had h a p pe ned and     I feel   some    comoRini cat i on could

    have    been given to them to              let them know what J»as

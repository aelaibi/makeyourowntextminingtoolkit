           Miss D.H. Shaipllng,

            1" December 1998

           Dear Miss Sharpling,


           I write to confirm the contents o f my telephone call to you of Friday 27* November and to
           express the concerns of the HFSG about the dday3 in the process of review by llie Ciuwn
           Prosecution Service.

           I asked when a derision might be tajraicd, and you were unable to give me a date in view of the
           oonipleaty ofd» case, There canbe no doufct that dwoaae has a wiuplcx history, and the HFSG
           has put m detailed rqwesentations about k, but I do wish to question whether it is appropriate that
           the review process upon winch the Crown Prosecution Service has embarked should be extended
           finther. Ii was on 1*' and 2* July that solicitors for the defendants first approached the CPS and
           asked that the case bo discontiimcd. Five months have passed and no decision has been rn»Aa and
           nrme, it appears, is imminent. Two months have passed since our last representations.

           The decision undo- section 23 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 as to whether to
           discontinue is awfy o i k lliat is intended to ease the burdens on courts, we«d out hopeless cases
           and those with poor prospects of conviction, and, where appropriate, to stop cash* on pubJio
           interest factors of a kind which can be identified siuiply. The draughtsman of the section frmlH
           not have contemplated a review of the papers lasting five months or moic.

           You know that ouj piimaiy position is that matters such as alleged unfiumess, the causes and
           effects o f the passage of time, and die alleged concealment of relevant evidence are primarily
           sutgecK which should be deak with by evidence and submissions fo uuuit on an abuse of process
           application. If there is doubt aha* these matters in die minds oftheCPS* surely the proper course
           is to leave ihem to be determined by the court*.

           You will appreciate that a large number of families are afibcted by your decision, and wish *o
           know what i.<going on. The impression grows with the increasing and frustrating delay that the
           CPS may be more concerned to defend or distinguish its original decision not to prosecute than
           simply to apply its normal crileiia.

         Furthermore, the ease is listed before the Leeds Magistrates Court again next Monday, 7*
         December, and we are conscious that we have responsibilities towards Thai court. Undoubtedly
         the stipcndiaiy magistrate will wish to have rafbraHtivm about the progress of the review so that
         he may know whether to set time aside, and if so how mush, for the purposes of committal. We
         shall have to take decisions this week as to whether to invite the court to commence the
         committal proceedings regardless of the review. It is not obvious that the court should await a
         possible decision to t&jcontimie, which could be taken at any stage in the proceedings, rather than
         start oomnrittol proceedings in the ordinaiy course of events.

         I should be grateful therefore if yon could write to us so that we receive a reply before the end
         of tliis week, and provide mate definite information for our own and the court’s purposes.



         Yours sincerely,


          rf./IdUwton.

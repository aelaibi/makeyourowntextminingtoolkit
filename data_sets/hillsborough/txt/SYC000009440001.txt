Dear Sir,

Re; Michael David Kelly (Deceased)

I have been approached by Mrs. Joan Sinclair, sister of Michael
David Kelly who lost his life at Hillsborough on 15th April, 1989.

Mrs. Sinclair informs me that circa January 1991, in the course of
the resumed inguest, she forwarded a letter to Dr. Popper.
Unfortunately she did not retain a copy of the same.  She has now
asked me to request a copy of her letter from your office.

I should be grateful if you would assist me in this matter.


Yours faithfully

     Dear Sirs,

     Michael David KELLY (deceased)

         Thank you for your letter concerning the above.

         I enclose a photocopy of Mrs. Sinclair’s letter of 22nd January,   1991 which I
         would presume to be the letter that you refer to.

         I have also enclosed a copy of a letter dated 18th February 1991 from
         solicitors indicating that Mrs. Sinclair no longer wanted             to be
         cal l ed .

         I trust that this is of assistance to you.



         Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If                        I have not
         heard from                                               have no                        names to
         submit

Dear !fe>» Kelly,

He:         M I C H m MfIB KBLLY (d e c e a s e d ).
As far as I am aware, you are not legally represented in respect
of the Inquest into the death of the above named.

I am writing to let you know that although it has been in
my mind to resume the adjourned Inquest on the 15th of January
1990, I have had to review my thinking on this.

You will be aware that the Birector of Public Prosecutions
has been asked tiJ look into the circumstances, and I have
decided that I will not be able to resume the Inquests for
some considerable time as I will have to review the matter
some time after the Birector of Public Prosecutions has
announced what action if any, he would want to take.

 I will be in touch with you again regarding this when I am
 able to do so, but you should anticipate that there will be
 some considerable delay before I am in a position to say
 anything definitive.

 Whilst writing to you, I have had numerous requests for copies
 of post mortem reports from solicitors representing other
 deceased persons.

 Whilst the release of the post mortem reports presents certain
 difficulties I have decided that subject to certain safeguards,
 I am prepared to release a copy to solicitors acting for the
 bereaved, or where that is not appropriate or convenient, to
 medical practitioners.

 Should you wish me to communicate with, your G.P. (or other medical
 practitioner) with a view to letting him have a copy of the post mortem
 report so that he may be able to go through it with you, I would
 be grateful if you could please let me know.

 It would also be helpful if you could set out clearly the name
 and address of the doctor involved.

 Finally, if you were to move house before the resumption of the
 Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please let me have a
 note of your change of address, so that I may be able to keep
 in touch with you as and when necessary.

 Yours sincerely,
                                                                           « 5 .H.Coroner,

  view, that the relatives should be able to learn the location, where it
  has been discovered, w h e r e their loved ones died and from what medical
  cause, Hopefully, this will assist the relatives in overcoming their
  grief."

  on the strict understanding that they are not to consider the generality
  o f what occurred at H i ll s borough nor apportion blame.

            I am a Police Constable         in the Soujfcft Yorkshire Police presently

            stationed in the Divisional Sua^ort Group at E Division, H e a dq ua rt er s,

           Heeley,   Sheffield.

            At 08.30 am (0830), Satur/ay 15 April                        1989 (150489),         I commenced

             uties this in relatiorj/to the FA Cup Semi Final, Liverpool FC v

            Nottingham Forest FC,

            In company with the group upon arrival                         I attended at the briefing this

             aking place at 1000 am in the North Stand.                               Upon completion we had a

            small break.        At 1115 am we took up our duties - Serial No. 21                          in the

            Lappings Ln end - standby area - shortly before noon a few fans had

            arjrived into the Leppings Ln end about 20 - 30 in total.

            Al/ noon our unit was directed by match Control                               to go to the Nottingham

            Forest end - Penistone R d , this to assist other officers                              re crowd

searched a number of Nottingham s u pj^erft ers before they gained access

to the ground.      Also assistejj-"in arrest of a drunk,              t 2.55 pm^

the unit was di rected^trtT take up a position in the jgyffK" t his was from

the sergeant           EDDISON,

As we g o t t h e    gym, at 3.05pm       (1505) w e ^ p r e   directed to go to the

L e ppirffqs Ln end- inner track area t<          tssist with the crowd.       As I

walked down the      track area North/#tand Icould             see about 100 peopie      on

the inner track and other pepfple climbing over the f e n c e .

The majority of the people seemed to me to be watching the football

match.     (These on the/inner tp4ck>.          They were just either sat down or
                        /       / f
 squatting down on /the i r h n e e s .

As I got to the Lane end of the pitch - I saw and heard a lot of

supporters shouting yet the Police to open the gates as they were

getting squashed jir\d that there was too many people in there.

A small gate wa4 open a t this time,           this       the right hand side of the

goal as you ^6ok at it.        People were g^fng through this and onto the

pitch area.;

A senior of f i cer at this time rjfn onto the pitch and inf ormed the

referee to stop the game.        Tj^Ls was Supt G R E E N W O O D .   I assisted other

officers to get      these peojfte through the g a t e ,       but as it was quite

small,   difficulty was     $/perienced.        Injured people then gained access

to the pitch area.      JR'ans were comming from the back of the crowd and

walking over the tops of the people in front of them.

Police officers and supporters then began to shake the fencing from

behind the goal area and I did also,            this was to enable the crowd of

fans to get onto the pitch area the fencing gave way and people were

then climbhing through.        Numerous     people obviously dead were also

passed through and laid on the pitch.              I assisted in passing the

bodies through the fenced area.
                                                                                PAGE       3
     A                                                                          SI 072

         Supporters and police officers had torn down the boardings          from around

         the pitch and carrying bodies to the gym a rea.        I then started to do

         this as there were too many officers around the goal area.          I assisted

         in carrying about seven people to the gym.        Some time later after this

         when all the dead had gone from the pitch area I rejoined my unit, as

         I had become split up from them.       I then went to the outside of

         Leppings Ln end and as I walked past near to the river I saw about ten

         dead bodies   covered up - shortly afterwards     I went back with my unit

         to the transit van and went on m o b i 1e pa tr ol .

         At S.30 pm (2030)   I went off duty.

                 ASKED ME IF I HAD TICKETS. WHEN I WAS ON MY WAY TO THE MATCH AT
                 ABOUT 2.25PM THERE WERE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WALKING IN THE
                 OPPOSITE DIRECTION THIS I THOUGHT STRANGE AS IT WAS NEARLY TIME
                 FOR THE MATCH. I SAW A STREET TRADER ATTACKED BY THE LIVERPOOL

AT ABOUT 2.50PM WHAT SEEMED LIKE A DISTURBANCE OCCURRED IN THE STANDING AREA
PEOPLE WHERE BEING LIFTED UP INTO THE STANDS. SEVERAL SEATS HAD BEEN TAKEN
BY NON TICKETS HOLDERS BUT THIS DID NOT CAUSE A PROBLEM, WHEN SUPPORTERS WERE
REQUESTED TO MOVE THEY DID SO. I SAW EVIDENCE OF VIOLENCE BY LIVERPOOL
SUPPORTERS TOWARD THE POLICE. AT FIRST THE WHOLE SITUATION SEEMED LIKE A
CROWD DISTURBANCE AND IT WAS NOT TILL A WHILE AFTER THAT BOTH POLICE AND
PUBLIC REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS I SAW OUTSIDE
THE GROUND WERE DRINKING AND AT 2.30PM THEY WERE MAKING NO ATTEMPT TO ENTER
T ^ GROUND.

                 WHEN I GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TUNNEL I BEGAN TO FEEL THE
                 PRESSURE BEHIND ME. I MOVED OUT OF THE WAY. AS MATCH PROGRESSED I
                 COULD SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCE, AS THE GAME WENT
                 ON PEOPLE WERE GOING TO THE BACK OF THE PEN AND ASKING PEOPLE TO
                 LIFT THEM OUT.

THE CRUSH EASED A LITTLE AS PEOPLE WERE GOING OUT. I SAW PEOPLE HELPING THE
INJURED ON THE PITCH. LIVERPOOL FANS SHOUTING TO EVERYONE TO HELP THEN OUT OF
THE PENS. IT WAS ABOUT 1520HRS BY THIS TIME. I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT AFTER
SEEING WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN THE PEN SO I WENT BACK TOWARDS THE TUNNEL. I
ASKED A POLICEMAN WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE SAID MOVE UP THE TOP AND OUT OIF
THE WAY PLEASE. WHEN I GOT TO TOP OF TUNNEL. I SAW 3 OR 4 BODIES LAY ON THE
FLOOR IN THE RECOVERY POSITION AND I NEVER THOUGHT FOR ONE MINUTE THAT THEY
WERE DEAD. I WAS IN THE COURTYARD IT WAS REALLY NOISEY. IT WAS DISTRESSING SO
I JUST NEEDED TO GET OUT OF THERE. I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
M O W T E D OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND THEY WERE TRYING THEIR BEST. THERE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN AT LOT MORE STEWARDS. THE MEMORY OF A LIVERPOOL LAD WHO CAME UP TO
ME CRYING AND SAYING PEOPLE ARE DYING DOWN THERE WILL STICK IN MY MIND FOR
THE REST OF MY LIFE. ALSO THE SCENES OF POLICE AND FANS GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH
AND HEART MASSAGES TO INJURED AND DYING          FANS.



                                         HE IS WILLING TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

WAS WITH MY FRIENDS                            ( SAME ADDRESS) AND HER FAMILY
                                                           CHESTER TEL NO


BEFORE WE ACTUALLY GOT INTO THE GROUND I SAW AN AWFUL LOT OF DRUNKEN
LIVERPOOL FANS CAUSING A NUSIENCE IN THE LEPPINGS LANE AREA. WHEN I
EVENTAULLY GOT TO THE SEAT WHERE I WAS SITTING IN THE WEST STAND A SAW A LOT
OF THE FANS CLIMBING OVER THE WALL. THE POLICE ATTEMPTED TO GET THEM DOWN
BUT THEY LOST CONTROL AND MOST OF THOSE CLIMBING OVER THE WALL APPEARED TO
HAVE TICKETS AND JUST FLASHED THEM IN FRONT OF THE OFFICERS FACES. THERE
APPEARED TO BE NO STEWARD CONTROL AT ALL AND PEOPLE WERE STILLING ENTERING
THE GAME THROUGH THE TURNSTILES AND OVER THE WALL. ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND
THE WEST STAND SOON BECAME PACKED AND THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD AND THAT IS
     EVERYTHING HAPPENED. THE POLICE OPENED THE GATES TO THE FENCE AS SOON
AS THEY COULD BUT NOBODY REALLY SEEMED TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON AND
SOME OFFICERS EVEN CLIMBED ONTO THE FENCE THEMSELVES AND ASSISTED IN DRAGGING
SOME OF THE FANS OVER.

THERE HAVE BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF ALLEGATIONS REGARDING LOOTING BUT I CAN SAY
THAT I DID NOT WITNESS ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

                 AND NOT BEING ABLE TO BREATH OUTSIDE I HAD TO SIT DOWN JUST
                 INSIDE THE TURNSTILE TO GET MY BREATH.  I HAD BEEN CRUSHED UP
                 AGAINST A WALL AND FEARED THAT THE WALLS WERE GOING TO COLLAPSE.
                 THE POLICE HORSE WAS ALSO BEING CRUSHED AND THE RIDER GALLOPED
                 HIM OUT OF THE CROWD.

                  ADDRESS NOT KNOWN, CAN BE CONNTACTED THROUGH CALLER.
AFTER WAITING A FEW MINUTES TO BREATH AGAIN, I SAW THAT THEY WERE OPENING THE
GATES. THE CRUSH CAME IN AND MY FRIEND AND I WAITED FOR THEM TO GO PASSED.
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO INTO THE STANDS BECAUSE IT LOOKED SO FULL SO THE STEWARD
TOOK PITY ON ME AND LET ME GO INTO THE SEATING AREA.     I WAS ABLE TO SIT ABOUT
4 ROWS BACK FROM THE FRONT IN THE WEST SETAND.     I COULD SEE THE CRUSHING BUT
THOUGHT IT WOULD SETTLE DOWN WHEN THE MATCH STARTED.    BUT EVENTUALLY REALISED
THM? IT WAS MORE THAN CROWD TROUBLE.      I DON'T BLAME THE POLICE FOR OPENING
t H F GATES OUTSIDE, A FEW MINUTES MORE AND THE DISASTER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED
OUTSIDE.

2.30PM, ALTHOUGH IT WAS BUSY OUTSIDE , TO ME IT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE
OVERCROWDED BEARING IN MIND IT WAS A SEMI FINAL. I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW I GOT
INTO THE GROUND, I THINK IT WAS THROUGH A TURNSTILE BUT I STILL HAVE MY
TICKET.IT WAS ABOUT 2.45PM WHEN WE GOT ONTO THE TERRACING, AGAIN ALTHOUGH IT
WAS CROWDED, IT WAS NO MORE THAN I EXPECTED FOR A SEMI FINAL. I WAS STANDING
ABOUT HALF WAY UP THE TERRACING TO THE RIGHT OF THE GOAL POST. FROM THAT
POINT ON I CAN'T RECALL MUCH, I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER ANY CRUSH. AT SOME
STAGE THOUGH I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS AFTER THE MATCH HAD STARTED OR NOT I
REMEMBER SEEING PEOPLE AT THE FRONT POURING THROUGH A LITTLE FENCE ONTO THE
PITCH.

 THE BLUE GATE IN THE WALL. MY FRIEND WAS TRODDEN ON BY A POLICE HORSE. I TOOK
 HIM TO A POLICE MAN WHO WAS STANDING BY THIS GATE AND ASKED HIM TO GET HIM TO
 THE FIRST AID POST. HE SAID HE WAS UNABLE TO AND TOLD HIM TO GO OUTSIDE AND
 FIND SOME FIRST ATq THERE. THIS FRIEND IS            I DONT KNOW HIS ADDRESS
 BUT WILL FIND OUT.
 WHILE WE WERE STANDING BY THIS GATE, IT WAS 2:50PM , THE GATE IN THE WALL
 OPENED . THERE WAS A MAD SCRAMBLE THEN TO GET INTO THE GROUND. I WENT INTO
 TffiL TUNNEL AND GOT JUST INTO THE CROWD. IT WAS JUST TO FULL SO I WENT TO THE
 R K     HAND SIDE TERRACE WHERE THERE WAS MORE ROOM . IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF
 MINUTES AND I REALLY HAD TO PUSH TO GET OUT.
 THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OF POLICE TO DIRECT THE CROWD WHEN THEY GOT TO TUNNEL.
 THE GAME HAD STARTED. THEN I SAW THE CRUSH START . PEOPLE WERE BEING PUSHED
 OVER THE TOP ONTO THE PITCH. I SAW POLICE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK AND THEN THE
 GATE IN THE FENCE WAS OPENED AND POLICE WERE HELPING TO GRAB PEOPLE OUT.
 I DID NOT SEE ANY FIGHTING DRUNKENESS OR HOOLIGANISM.
 THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT BUT I COULD NOT HERE IT.

  I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH
                    SAME ADDRESS
                 SAME ADDRESS
          FRIEND OF       I WILL FIND OUT ADDRESS

 ON THE WAY FROM THE GROUND I WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT WITH A POLICEMAN
 WHO TOLD ME TO MOVE MY CAR TO ALLOW AMBULANCES TO GET PAST WHICH I DO
 UNDERSTAND . BUT THIS POLICEMAN BECAME ABUSIVE AND MY SON PASSED A REMARK
 ABOUT ALL THE DEAD IN THE GROUND WHICH THIS POLICE MAN REPLIED TOUGH LUCK
 HIS NUMBER IS     AND I HAVE MENTIONED THIS ON RADIO LIVERPOOL AND MADE A
 COMPLAINT.

I WASN'T BY THE GATE SO I DON';T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE THERE. THE GATE WAS
OPENED AND I WENT THROUGH, NOBODY ASKED TO SEE MY TICKET AT ALL. I DIDN'T SEE
ANY POLICE OR STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUNDS. I WENT AROUND TO THE RIGHT HAND
SIDE PEN, BY THIS TIME THE PLAYERS WERE ALREADY ON THE PITCH GETTING READY TO
KICK OFF. I WAS BEING PUSHED AND SHOVED AND AS I'M SMALL WASN'T VERY
COMFORTABLE. I STOOD ON SOMEBODIES SHOULDERS AND CLIMBED UP INTO THE SEATING
AREA AND SAT ON THE STEPS. THERE WERE PEOPLE SCREAMING DOWN BELOW, I COULD
SEE THAT THEY WERE SQUASHED UP THE FRONT RAILINGS. THE GAME STARTED, I SAW
PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES, THE POLICE THEN OPENED THE GATES, I THOUGHT
T V THE POLICE WAS GOING TO MOVE THEM INTO A DIFFERENT PEN FROM OUT OF THE
FRONT, AS PEOPLE COULDN'T GO BACKWARDS. I STARTED TO HELP PEOPLE UP INTOTHE
SEATS AND FANS WERE HELPING EACH OTHER ON THE PITCH.

WORKS AWAY FROM HOME SO NEEDS AT LEAST ONE WEEKS NOTICE IF SOMEBODY VISITS.

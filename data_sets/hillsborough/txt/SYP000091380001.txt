            On Sa tu rd ay   13 April      1989    I went      to the F.A Cup               F i nal    between

            Liverpool    & Notts Forest at Hi 1 i s b o r o u g h x l          am a Li verpool         Supporter.

            I got my ticket        from a fislend.            It was a £6 V a n r i i n o   t i cket for

            L>a.oi nas Lane.       I t r a ve lle d to^t-he game with                                           &

                                     We    caught     the tr'•ain J t ^ t 1 Pancras St a t i on         in Lon do n

            and travelled straight            to S h e f f i e l d ^
                                                                              <^rr
            When we got to She ff ie ld we were                put an^&jjs^es by the Police £m d taken

            to the ground.       We had ar ri v ed       in Sh ef fi el d at about          12 noon     (1200).

            On the way to the ground              I did not            see any supporters    drinking      in       the

            streets.     I did not see disorder               ordrunken       pi^qple outside         the ground.

            We arrive d at the ground aYw ^went                   to apark area wh^re we ate our

            lunch.     We then went        to the grobml            and got there about        13.30 hrs

            (1330).    The queues were         quite o r d e r l b ^ a nd not very       long.

I did not see anyone          climbing over the walls                to get    in and        I did not

see any gates       open other       thaTr-4the turnstiles.

X went    into the ground by going thXpug h a turnstile.                            There were

On entering       the ground        I did not see any signs            telling me where                 to

go.     The other two had been to the ground before so                         I just        followed

them    into the tunnel.

I do not       remember seehsqg any Police Of ficers                 or St ewards       by the

tunnel    entrance i>^We w e n t ' d ow n the tunnel           and    into Pen 4.           We got

into    the    pen about    1345

                                "        (1345).     There was         plenty of        room       in

there.        We could go any where we       liked.        We decided to stand near

to the back.                                  \           ‘w              ,,         c --

The    pen gr adually fi^N^ed up until            about    14.45       (1445).       I thought

that    the pen was as full a'sv it sho ul d have been.

We were still all          together at     this    time and we were            being        pushed

arou nd and towards        the front.       We did not want            to go towards           the

front and we kept          tb^ing to get     back.        At some stage            before     the game

started theVe was a big s-fctrge from behind                   I was     pushed      right down to

the front of the^^en and s e p er at ed            from the other          two.       I was        then

crushed and could not move.              People were screaming                out    for help.               I

saw a man a few feet away from me,                 whom    people were shouting                to

help just sudden ly disapear down             into the         crowd and on to the floor.

I could not describe          him at all.

There was a man wi t h his head on my shoulder who was                             having     trouble

breathing.        He was Hyper       ventalating.         Then   he passed out.               I bit him

on his    chin to try and bring him aro un d as                  I could not move my arms.

I was    pushing his head wi t h mine         to try and bring             him around.              After a

short    time he came aro un d his eyes            opened but he did not say anything.

He was a white male about 5 ’1 0 !l - 6 ’ tall.                      In his mid to          late 2 0 ’s

               with one days     growth of beard on his face.                    I can not     remember what he

               was wearing or an yth in g else about              him.

               again.    At this     time    people were     climbing over the front               fence to get

               out and on to the        pitch.     There were Police Officers                stopping       people

               who    climbed over getting        on to Tfrs pitch.             People were shouting             for

TO^i£^         I saw a Police Woman just to the left of the goal                        just    looking      towards

               pressure eased on me and           I could move.              The man was   still    leaning on

               me.     I asked someone else to help me to help the man out.                           We    put his

               arms   over our shoulders and helped him walk out of the                        pen.        His   eyes

               were   open but he did not say anything.                      We had wa lk e d up the terrace

               to the entrance       to the tunnel.        When we all          suddenly fell      to the

               ground.     I do not know        if he had collapsed or not.                He seemed to bang

               his head hard when he fell           down.     As    I fell       I rolled over and as            I got

               up a Police Offic er as ked me         if    I was alright.            I then just      carried on

               and wal ke d out of the tunnel.            I was    in a daze.         I did not know what              to

               do.

               When    I came out of the tunnel           I could see a lot of             people who were

               lying on the floor        being given mo ut h to mou th and heart massage.

               I saw a fan sat on the steps           to the stand hugging              his knees.          He was

               on his own.      I as ked him      if he was alright and             I brought      him a cup of

               tea.

               I wa l k e d aro un d trying     to find                  &                 I could not       see

               them so I sat down had a cigarette and tried to gather my thoughts.

               I then tried to get          back down the tunnel              to look for the other          two but

             I was    not a ll ow ed      to go down.        I went    outside    the ground.       There was

         *   a lot of people outside.                I looked to see         if I could see        the others

             but   I could not.           I then wal ke d up Lep pings Lane and             phoned home from

             a telephone           box.   I then got the bus          to the S t at io n and then got the

             train home.

             At the Stati on          I saw              he told me that                      *ias alright and

             was   still at         the ground     looking for me.

             I think        that    the Police liiat were at the back of               the West Stand where

             a bit hard on fans.              They woul dN qp t   let     people back down the tunnel             to

             look for friends.

             I had a mark           on my wrist where my w a t c h had been.             I did not have     any

             other    injuries.           I did not get to hospital          or to     the doctors.

we    therefore            continued              our      patrol.            At    t his      t ime     there      were       probably

forty       or     fifty men and youths                           stood       outside          those        premises       drinking

beer.          The      situation            outside            the R o y a l       Hotel        on Pe^nJ^tone R d/8 radf :i.e 1 d

persons          outside         those         premises,             all      drinking.           The       footpath       along         both

s ides      of     the     pretni ses          was      full       of    p e o p 1e s t o o d         s n o u 1 de r to    s h o u 1de r

drinking,             some      were       spilling             into     the       roadway        and       others       were       stood     on

the      opposite          side       of B r a d f i e l d         Rd.        Although           these       people       appeared           to

be    reasonably             behaved           they were             obviously            in h i g h        spirits.           I remembsr

later       on due         to    the       number          of     peo p l e    who       by    kick      off      time    would       be     the

worse       for       drink.          This        belief         was     reinforced              by    the     weather         conditions

th a t    day.          It w a s      a    f ine     warm        spring        day an d          I felt        that      the    weather

conditions              themselves             would        contribute              towards           people       standing          outside

public         houses        drinking.               The        situation           outside           the    Royal       Hotel       wa s

being       monitored            by       uniform          officers.               I noticed           at    this     t ime     t h at      our

actually        being      violent,        I was      firmly        c o nvinced       that a large

had no       information to offer as                       to the    'nature of           the     problem at            the

At this          time      things a p p e a r e d     quite       confused.         I was         told by D e t ectiv

 or a few seconds                 there was a confusion                  oy   me s s a g e s      over the          radios

what was          happening         (although         I do not make a n y            criticisms               of anyone

for    this).           I a s s u m e d that     the       problem was        one    of a public                  order

attended            at       the       gyrnnas i uro^yhe r e                   I saw          Detective                Inspector             POL    TO WELL

and     some        other             CID    officers.                    Detective                Inspector                POL    TOWELL

instructed                  me    to       recall          all       CID       officers                to    the       gymnasium             and     I    did       so

over      channel                19    UHF.           The       situation                inside             the    gymnasium             was       one        of

confusion               simply             due    to       a    lack       of       information.                       This       was    inevitable                 1

believe            as       at    that       stage             nobody          knew       the          extent          or    full       nature           of    the

disaster            which             had    occurred.                    On       my    way       into          the    gymnasium             I    saw        one

or    two     members                 of    the       public          who          were       hastily             trying          to    find

stretchers                  or    barriers             to       use       as       improvised                stretchers.                 It       was     clear

that      something                   terrible             had       happened.                 At       that       point          I was       in    no        doubt

that      there             'were      fatalities                and       serious             casualties.

           C o nstable     POL BUTLER was           deeply shocked.                   He told me that              the young

           on the floor and then other                     bodies were           brought in by Police                   Of i cars

           rightly so        in my view as obv i o u s l y the                  dead are          beyond help.             I

           realised that at            some    later stage            it would         be ext r e m e l y      important                th

following         "Operation Support"                 I cannot         give       in f o r m a t i o n as      to what

time     turnstiles were               opened nor on the               situation          in Leppi n g s          Ln    prior

to,    or after         the gates were              opened - indeed               I only      later         became aware

that    gates      had been opened.,,



However,         I w o u l d add that          having P o l i c e d m any football                        matches      at

going     back     to    1973,    I have         never       seen so m uch           p r e-match drinking

outside      public       houses as           I did that           day,,   Although           I had         remarked         that

there might         be trouble           later       (page 2)        I had not          f o r eseen and           never

w o u l d have     drea m e d that        such a disaster w o u l d                  occur      or was         even

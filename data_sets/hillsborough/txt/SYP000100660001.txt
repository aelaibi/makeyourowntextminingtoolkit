DAVID R LINDSAY                                                                                                        R 242




Police Constable 2613

Ring Farm, Barnsley




At 7-30 a.m.           on Saturday 13th April 1989 I commenced duty at Ring Farm, Cudworth

where       I prepared my mount,              Police      Horse      Cavalier,       for duty      at    the    FA Cup Semi

Final between Notts Forest v Liverpool FC.

A t -8.30 a.m. that same date we were transported to Niagara Stables where I was to

be    briefed      by    Insp       Hand-Davis       who      was    the    officer    in    charge       of    the    mounted

department.

At    the    briefing        I was    teamed up with            PC    3920 Evans,       PC    4365      Edge    and PC    4886

Narey of the Merseyside mounted department.

Phase       I of our         duties was to patrol the rear of the South Stand at Hillsborough

FC.     Phase III            of our duties was to be              in the park near to             the ground where car

parking       facilities        had    been made         available         for visiting fans.           We were       to be   in

position 15 minutes before the end of the game.

At    11.35 a.m.        that date we made             our way to the ground.                 I showed        the Merseyside

officers who were walking with me the layout of the ground and flash points that

might       occur.           Having   done    that     we patrolled          the    rear of       the    South    Stand.      We

escorted       both     Notts       Forest    and    Liverpool        team     coaches to         the players         entrance

without any incident.                 I contacted ground control and informed them of this. They

acknowledged my calls.

Between       2-30      pm    and    2.35    pm   that     same     date    I was    stood    near      to     the Sheffield

Wednesday supporters                souvenir shop when              I heard a message on the radio from Sgt

Thomas       who   I    knew    to    be    working      on    Leppings       Lane    end    of   the    ground.        He was

asking for assistance.                 As his message was being transmitted amother message from
DAVID R LINDSAY                                             -2-                                                                R242



someone else cut in and I couldn't hear clearly what was being said.

Several minutes later I again heard Sgt Thomas asking for assistance.                                                    I knew Sgt

Sorsby    was          working       on Penistone          Road which was          further away          from Leppings Lane

than I was so I contacted ground control and informed them that I was attending

plus    the        3       mounted    from        Merseyside.       Ground       control       acknowledged         my    call.    We

arrived within               1-2 minutes           at    the Leppings Lane end.                I could see several young

people        being         passed    over        the    crowds    heads     from       the    front     of   the    turnstiles.

There    was a constant stream of fans climbing over the walls                                          into the ground.              I

also noticed there were two mounted officers in amongst the crowd.                                                  The more the

3 Merseyside horses tried to get in the worse the pushing got from the back.

The    crowd were packed like sardines                            there   appeared to be no way                 to prise       a way

in.     I began             to   shout      for    the    fans    to move    back       and    stop    pushing.          The     crowd

wouldn't listen, in fact they became very volatile as the time went by. The whole

area wreaked of alcohol.                     There were people still drinking from cans and bottles.

Every    time          they were         asked     to    stop     pushing    they       just    jeered    and    hurled        abuse.

There were             an awful       lot of people          screaming for Gate                'B'   to be opened.            From my

position       there was             little I could do with the crush so I went to the wire fence

opposite       the turnstiles and moved approx 30-40 fans who I ascertained hadn't got

tickets.           I moved them towards                  the iron gates which were closed, and where I saw

a line of mounted policemen.                            I heard a lot of shouting about a gate going to be

opened        so       I    left     what    I     was    doing and       went     to    gate        'C' which      is    a    double

concertina metal                 gate.       I put my horse           across      the     gate.        I then saw a man in a

yellow jacket go to gate                     'C' which was then opened enough                        for him to get        in.

Suddenly both gates were                     opened wide. I could see into the ground especially the

area     at    the         back of the West              Stand.     I saw a group of                 approx   500    stood.       They
DAVID R LINDSAY                           -3-                                                 R242



appeared   to be   waiting   for people      who   hadn't   got   into   the   ground.   For a short

while   no one   came   through gate   'C'   then a rush of approx 500 came through them.

The foot officers and myself tried in vain to slow them down. The crowd were not

in the least bit bothered they just pushed passed us.

On seeing the rush of fans go through              the gate the fanswho        were already   inside

ran off down the tunnel followed by the others.

Within 1-2 minutes the crowd had eased off and the gate was shut.

Sgt Sorsby arrived and directed me           to clear off the people           that had gathered in

the same place as before that is along the wire fence.                   I again established they

had not got tickets.

When the crowd had dispersed I went with Sgt Sorsby to an area under                       the North

Stand and was put on standby there.

I have been a mounted officer for over             10 years and in all of that time        Ihaven't

seen a crowd as intent at getting into             a football match.

  ADLINGTON v(W ^JCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

  You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 December 1998 following the receipt of a
  letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service’s decision not
  to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
  cnminal proceedings against your clients with a view to discontinuing them.

 You ask for further information, (1) as to the factual matters on which the CPS relied and
 identifying which parts of the evidence is "new" since the Crown Prosecution Service last
 considered the case; and (2) as to the way the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors
 in deciding whether to intervene.


 These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors the Crown Prosecution Service
 considers when deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a defendant
w>th a view to discontinuance. I, may help if I set out again in broad tenns the approach the
Service adopts to these decisions.


AS you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors indeed s«s out the general principles applied by
t e em ce when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over- or
whether to institute proceedings or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
Crown Prosecution Service decided in 1997 that the evident avaiUble                    th ,, tlmc WIS not
sufficient, m m v,ew. to provide a realistic prospect of the conviction of either of your clicnts
for an offence.      However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and
•
        representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your clicnts,
        the CPS should s e * m (||ly   .0identify whether there is now any new evidence sufficient to’
        provide a realistic |f|)speci!'il«f a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in a private
     prosecution w i^ ^ yi^w to terminating it calls for altogether different considerations to be
     appbed. It W '& e possible for a private prosecution to continue notwithstanding that the CPS

    15                   th* baSiS ° f itS 0W" “ Mssmenl o f * 6 strength of the evidence, that the
    ovjjaB ^jpJld pass the evidential sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic
    ^fospect'bf a conviction").

                                                           \

    In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(S ofthe Prosecution of Offences Act 1985,
    which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the right of private
    individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS Jo bring criminal
    proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the Umitation'to fe C P S may
    nevertheless taJce over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to terminating those
   proceedings. The Service takes the view that it should not exercise that power unless there is a
   particular need to do so on behalf of the public.


  Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
  whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
  Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
  it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
  general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation Paper
  No, 149 Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).


 Generally, the Service will not take over a private prosecution with a view to terminating it
 unless one or more of the following applies:


( a y       there is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution started in these circumstances
            would be unfounded and ought not to be Remitted to continue.


 (ll)       the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
            (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious or vexatious or jjlrffcnce Jgr            £r
            which the defendant should clearly have been       cau tion ed ,   or where the defendant is
            terminally ill and the offence is serious).
  (iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.
                       ..lib- ’'L,
  In this case the d eci^h notWintervene was considered at a very senior level within the Service,
  by the Director ^fi^asiwork Evaluation. After careful consideration, he concluded in respect
  of the c h a rts jjfimnsiaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for the
                      :^were ejich considered against each individual separately) that he could not
                               i case to answer. It was not right therefore for the Service to take over
                         a view to terminating them.


 Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate course to take in these
 circumstances, he concluded that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the one
 remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield of attempting to pervert the course of justice, albeit
 he had foimed the v ie w that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge alone. The charge
 of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against
 one who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer. Nevertheless, in the context
 of the disaster as a whole that charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
 Duckenfield and he concluded that his approach to that charge should be led by his conclusions
 on the charge of manslaughter.


 He considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that should
 lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance but came to the conclusion that
 [any] public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour.
Nor did he consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.




I should point out that the Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed
reasons for its decisions and we do not in any event consider it appropriate in this case to provide
an analysis of the evidence. However, in all the circumstances of this particular case and against
the background of its history, we did consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into
account in more detail than was contained in the Service’s letter dated 18 December 1998.

 HILLSBOROUGH: RE ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


 S ' o n 0”                  dated 22 Dec' mber’ which 1 received on retum &om “v

 I have considered the papers and note that you now prefer to have written advice rather than to

 y       1no doubt wish to consider that option after reading this letter. Because of the nature of
     ni?!! fSUggeSr        y0U should consider doing so - Philip Havers QC seems to have been

 in respect of the decision not to intervene.

 Giving reasons for decisions
 The CPS does not have a common law obligation to give detailed reasons for its decisions. Its

aS S ted b t     n "'      d“ lsi0ns m not judicial in the sense of being adjudications. That was
S T fL tio n in »                      T " 7 W ‘,l™>'31 M y 1997 and it also follows fiom
t&e decision in R v Civil Service Board ex parte Cunningham [1991] 4 All ER.

The CPS is not obliged to give detailed reasons for its decision not to intervene despite the
detailed questions posed by the solicitors for the defendants in their letter dated 18 December


              Pr?ceedings for Judicial review are in prospect, a key practical consideration in
p e 3 n r a e ° C o u n m .T ‘ ' T          avoidmS proceedings being brought or, if that fails,

being granted. If the decision letter is put before a Court (as it surely would be) the CPSv

   argued by the intending applicants.

   Sreondly, given that the events of Hillsborough and the nature of the decisions already taken

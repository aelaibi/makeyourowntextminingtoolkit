3.1   Whatever th e u ltim a te r e s p o n s i b i l i t y o f th e P o lic e the Authority w ill have
      to bear any c o s t of compensation over and above insurance p rovision of £8*2
      m i l l i o n . In th e l i g h t o f comments made by th e In su r e rs a t th e A u t h o r i t y 's
      meeting on 18th August and a l s o the estim a te s of t o t a l c o s t s of
      compensation t h e r e i s a very real p o te n tia l t h a t th e Authority w ill be
      involved in co n sid era b le exp en d itu re.

3.2    Because of t h i s p o te n tia l i t i s considered a p p r o p ria te f o r o f f i c e r s of the
       A uthority to "shadow" th e conduct of the claims by Municipal Mutual
       Insurance Limited. This would include taking a p p r o p ria te legal advice and
       involvement in th e n e g o tia tio n s with o th e r i n s u r e r s and a ls o th e S teerin g
       Committee of S o l i c i t o r s . S ubject to t h i s i t would seem a p p r o p ria te t h a t
       agreement i s reached with th e I n s u r e rs t h a t the i s s u e s be r e f e r r e d back to
       th e Authority f o r d isc u ssio n and comment before any s u b s ta n tiv e de cisio n
       i s taken with regard to l i a i b i l i t y and o r s e ttle m e n t of claim s.

       consequential c o s t s of th e Hillsborough Stadium d i s a s t e r .

5.    Recommendation

5.1   That o f f i c e r s of the Authority "shadow" th e Municipal Mutual Insurance
      Limited in the conduct of th e claims f o r compensation and r e p o r t back to
      th e Committee on developments as they a r i s e .

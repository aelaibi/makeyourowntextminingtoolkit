              I am a Police Constable              in the S o uth Yorkshire Police,     at present

              stationed at Maltby.

              At 8.00am on Saturday 15th April               1989,    I commenced duty at Maitby

              Police Station,       from where        I was transported to Hillsborough F o o t b a l l

              Ground,    Sheffield.

              At 10.am a briefing was Me 1d in the main s t a n d , which I a t t e n d e d . My

              detail was Serial Nq yt*, which entailed the supervision of Nottingham
                                                                  ---------------------
              Forest Supporters and traffic on Herries Road South,. I took up these

              duties at 11.15am. At 3.00pm,              Phase 1 of this detail was        completed and

              it was our intention to attend Claywheels Lane for a meal,                       however,
                                                                                   PAGE
       *                                                                           S2942

           stand at it ’s junction with the Hop,     further directed to onto the

           pitch and form a cordo/j/across the pitch near to the goal at the

           Leppings Lane end ^ y f t h e gr ou nd!

           Upon arrival at/this      point I saw that many of the supporters from this

           section of Vne stand were on the pitch and many of them appeared dazed

           and distressed.

           11 appeared that the re was some major      problem inside the stand,    and

           more and more people were trying to get through the gaps       in the wire

           fencing and onto the pitch. General       control was maintained of the

           crowd coming onto the playing area. This       control was kept until all

           the   crowd had left the stand.

           At 4.45pm we left the ground to perform stand by duties on Penistone

           Road, at it ’s junction with Herries Road S o u t h .
                                           1
           At 5.20pm we returned to the main stand where an appraisal       of the

           d a y ’s events was given by a senior officer. We were stood down at 5.

           4 5 p m , returning to Haltby at 7.30pm where after a further de-briefing,

           we retired from duty at 8.00pm.

              daughter            I am    a    Liverpool                   orter       and    have       been    since        I was     about

              final       match.         I am       a    season      ticket       holder          and    although         I   c o u l d n ’t    get

              a    ticket         for    the       match      myself       my   friend        got       one   for    me.

              At    about         10.00       am    (100      hrs)    on    the    day       of    the    match,         myself      and       nine

              mates       started         out       to    the     ground        from    Liverpool.            W e ’ re    all      friends       and

                we    hired          a mini         bus      to        get    down      there ,




                The     traffic           was       quite          clear,         we     had        left        early      to      avoid         it,       and    we

about       10 y e a r s           old    was       lifted          up a b o u t            three          foot          above          the       crowd       and

I was       inside         the          ground          I waited            in       the     yard          area          for    them.             1 d

he    agreed        and        the       club       wanted          that         and        had       tried          to       get       it    but       the

Police       hadn't            agreed.




Whilst       I was        waiting              for       my      friends             I saw        a       blue       concertina/fype                         gate

              breathe          out.          Some       lads       were       on       the        big      barriers            down       the          middle       of

              the    terraces               helping          people          but       they        c o u l d n ’t       reach        me.




              Eventually               I managed             to    slip       down          and       go     under        the       bar^/ier            and       for    a

              split       second            I thought             I would          get        trampled             on     d o w n yt he re,             a    fellow          in

              front       of      me    grabbed          me       once       I'd       got        under       the       bariyier          and          lifted       me       up

again       to     re-~gain m y              balance.              Then       I    could       see       up     hill       then      I had             been

too    low,        but    this          time        I was      highter             up,      stood        up     straight           so     I

thought          I'd     have          to    try     and      dodge          the    rest       of    the        crash        barriers              as    we

were     pushed          forward.




Apart       from        the       initial           surge      of     the         crowd       when       I got        to     the     end          of    the

tunnel        which       pushed             me     against         the       barrier,             the     rest       of     the     time          was

just    a     gradual             pushing           forward.             I    c o u l d n ’t m o v e          at    all      in a       way        you

wanted.            I had          to    move        with      the     crowd.             I was       gradually               getting              pushed

down     the       terraces             towards          the       front.           As      I went         I was        really          trying           to

stand       up,     just          keep       on m y      feet       and       if    anyone          stumbled           by     me     I'd          try    to

help     them.             I could               hear     people all               around       me       s ay i n g the L o r d ' s               prayer

for     people,           they          were        o b v i o u s l y dead,          they       were          s t a n d i n g up.       It         was

that     packed          that          if    I stood          on    someone             I w o u l d n ’t        have       known

anyway.          Sometimes              my       feet    were       off       the       ground.            There       were         people

crying        around          me,       and       people       who       looked          like       they        had     no    life        in       them,

t he   only        r eas o n t h e y             d i d n ’t f a l l      was       be c a u s e     we     we r e     packed,           but        the

crowd       was     always             moving         being        pushed.




Eventually              I found             myself       down       at       the    f ro n t ,y#y          the      gate      t h e re        were

straight           to     try          and       stop    myself pushing                   against             th em too much.                     It

must     have       been          about          3.HO    pm    ( 1 5 2 0 >irs>           by    then.            I shouted            to       a

The     gate       was    open          and        peo pie     were          g e t t i ng     pul 1 e d       through         the       g a t e , and

People        were       shouting                around       me    that          someone          had     fainted           and     that

^As    a    Policeman                 started             p u l l i ng     nye o u t          from    the       gateway              I    real i s e d            my

foot,        (right              f o o t ) was            t rappe/ against                     the    wall.            I shouted                   to    him

that        my       l eg    was          trapped          a n y I c o u l d n ’t              get    out       but        he    kept          pulling                at

me.         Next        I told             another           /an      and       he       pulled       on       my     leg       to       free       me.           It

was        hard       getting              through           the      gate          because          it    was       still           crushed             and

there        was        a wall             w h i ch w a s        waist          h eight, also                  so    many        people             were

trying           to     get       through,                the    gate         was        too       small.




 I then          found           myself          on       the    pitch,             my       shoe    had       come        off,          then       whilst             I

was        sat       there        trying             to    get     my      breath             back    a    St       J o h n ’s       person             and       a

steward              came        up       to    me    to     ask      if      I was           alright          or     if    I wanted                to       go       in

the        ambulance,                 I said          I was        okay,            my       clothes       were        ripped             and       later

someone              threw        my       shoe       over       to      me     -    it       was    split          open        too .




Then        I walked              down          to    about        the        halfwayline.                     I was        still             clutching                my

 chest       and        a    Notts             Forest        fan      from          the       seats       shouted           for          me    to       sit       down

 in    his       seat,           so       I went          and    sat       there.              I waited             there        till          after          the

 tannoy          announcements                       were       over       and       till          everyone           had       gone.              The       people

        When     everyone             started          to    go    at    about        4.30        pm     <1630      hrs )       I    left     too.        I

        went     out       the       way    I had          come,       under       the      stands,          back      to     L e p p i ngs       Ln

        to     get    back,          and    we       all    went       back    together

        the     ground.              There       were       no    stewards          or      signs        (greeting            me     to    the     side

         cont i n u e .         The    gate          was    only       half    ajar         anyway.           There/should                 have        been

        some     stewards             in    the       tunnel       entrance           to     stop        people/going                through           into

        all,     there          were       no    queues          and    the    crowds                       not     controlled, 1 think

         this    was       a    direct          result       to    what       h a p p e n a c inside.




        There        were       no    tannoy          announcements                ux& y i- v e l a t e             on a n d         they     weren't

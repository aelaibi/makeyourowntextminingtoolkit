A   rumour      began          that       the     ma tch was          off       and    the     pitch        had        been    invaded

                seriously          injured.            Other       traffic          mobiles       then       began        to a r r i v e     and       it

                was    decided        that          2752 would          stay       with    the    barrier           and    I would          go    into

                the    ground        to a s s i s t .

                I entered          the     g r o u n d at a b o u t          3.15    pm f r o m the          entrance           between          the

                North Stand and                 the    S p i o n Hop.

                I was       directed           to    join a       line of o f f i c e r s ^ a c r o s s         the       centre       of the

                pitc h.       In f r o n t          of me    fans       and     police      officers          were        intermingled,

                the    majority           of    fans       seemed       to    be    dazed       but    there was           the     occasion

                when    I saw        fans       shouting          at    officers          And    pointing           at    them,       but    other

                fans    tried        to    calm       them down and                lead    t h e m away.

                The    fans    in th e          West       Stand       were     pointing         and    chanting           and     people         were

                climbing       from        the       stand    into        the      terrace.

                The    fans    behind           us w e r e    fairly          quiet       and    seemed       to     sense       that

                something          was     amiss.

S-   f ; 'x     A   scuffle        began        in    the a r e a       below       the    Police       control           box a n d as we
     J   *
                moved       forward        it a p p e a r e d      so     did      the ^ o w d        and a     cry       rose,       so we       were

                ordered       back        by    one    Senior          Of f i ce r /jfn f r o n t      of    the     line.

                S t a n d i n g on    the       line,       the    ground          appeared       to    be a b s o l u t e l y        p ac ke d and

                I felt       that     th e      cheer       from the          Spion Hop would                have        brought       the       f ans

                out    of   t he L i v e r p o o l         terraces          and    onto    the       pitch.

                We were       -UTen d i recjM»d to                leave       the    ground and             d eal    w ith c r owds

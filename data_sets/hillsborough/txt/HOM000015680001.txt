METROPOLITAN POLICE CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBAT.T. MATPTTRS


I attach a draft submission to Ministers, which seeks their
approval for increased Metropolitan Police charges for policing
the insides of football grounds.

2. The increased charges are consistent with the well established
Government policy that football clubs should meet the full cost
of policing the insides of grounds.   However, as you will see,
the new charges will mean very large increases for some clubs.

3. The draft points to possible criticism from clubs: they may
say that the police are making it impossible for them to afford
the officers which are essential for safety.   How real this
complaint would be, I do not know.   The draft suggests that, if
a club were really put in financial crisis by the increased
charges, we might have to ask the Met not to impose them in full.

4. The Met are anxious to start discussing the new arrangements
with clubs very soon, as they wish to have contracts in place in
time for the start of the new season.   We need, therefore, to
get Ministerial approval as quickly as possible.   However -
subject to your views - I think that we shall have to consult DoE
first.   The draft submission covers a draft letter to the
Minister for Sport.

5.The Met have agreed to tell the League and FA about the new
arrangements once they have been approved.

6. In view of the very tight schedule, could I ask for comments
on the drafts by Tuesday, please?   I am sorry to give such short
notice.

        CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON


        This submission seeks Ministers'            agreement to the revision of the
        charges for policing football matches in London.                    It suggests that
        DOE Ministers should be alerted to the changes, given the financial
        implications for football clubs,            and the sensitivity of the issue
        following the Hillsborough disaster.


        Background
        2.      The   view    of     successive     governments       has   been    that,    in
        principle,     the    full    costs    of   each   officer     deployed     inside    a
        football ground should be charged for.               (The statutory position is
        described in Annex A.)          In practice, however, the recovery of full
        costs is not always possible.           Officers on duty outside the ground,
        for the purposes        of   crowd    and traffic    control,       are   regarded as
        performing proper police duties,             and the cost is met from police
        funds.


        3.      Although     these   principles     seem    to   be    generally     observed
        throughout the country, the amount charged is at the discretion of
        the police authority.


        Metropolitan Police Arrangements
        4.      The present agreement for charging at London football matches,
iA.C-   approved by Ministers, was reached between the Metropolitan police
        and the London football clubs in 1984 and introduced at the start
           of    the    1984/85   season.    Under the arrangement,      the Metropolitan
  u c.     police and each club agree on the number of officers to be deployed
           inside the ground at a "normal" match, and the increased number to
           be provided at "problem" matches.           The charge is then calculated on
           the basis that each officer is employed for 3 hours at the standard
           rate, with an additional charge levied for overheads.                  No charge is
           made for travelling time,          or for the fact that many officers are
           employed on overtime.


           Review of the Present Arrangements
           5.      The Metropolitan jpolice have reviewed their charging policy,
           and concluded that the clubs are being undercharged.                   The primary
           causes of this undercharging are:


                   i.     in practice, more officers are having to be deployed
                          inside the grounds than the agreement with clubs
                          stipulate;


                  ii.     in practice, officers are working more than the standard
                          3 hours inside the ground;


                 iii.     travelling time, for which officers are paid, is not
                          included in the charge;


                 vi.      officers at football matches are often employed on over­
                          time.


IA - c -
           6.      The Metropolitan j?olice have estimated that these factors lead
           to a shortfall in revenue of about £l.lm.               This is almost exactly
           the sum charged to London clubs at the moment, so full recovery of
           costs would double the charges to clubs.


           New Charging Proposals
ac- .      7.      The Metropolitan police propose that from the 1989/90 season,
           the    force    should   base    its   charges   for   policing   of    individual
           football matches on:
                  a.      the actual number of officers deployed on duties inside
                          the ground (to be agreed in advance with club officials);
                          and
        b.      an estimate of the actual number of hours required for
                those duties (the estimate for each type of game to be
                agreed in advance with club officials).


In addition, but not to be introduced until the 1990/91 season:


        c.      the charge for each officer to be increased by a further
                one hour in order to achieve at least partial recovery
                of the cost of travelling time.


8.      The changes in charges                                       1989/90 season simply
represent an adjustment to reflect changes in practice: they do not
                                     fr& tfcu
amend the baaie- pri«cip±es'£agreed in 1984.                        The proposal to include
a     charge     for    travelling         time     from     next    year     is,     however,     a
departure from agreed practice, since a decision was taken in 1984
not to charge for travelling time.


9.      The Metropolitan police have rejected the notion of trying to
charge clubs           for overtime.             Since it could be argued that, with
drastic        alterations     to     police        rotas,    it    would                     most
football matches without any overtime being incurred, the Met. have
concluded that it is not worth taking the clubs on on this issue.


10.     Annex B gives details                   of the actual       charges    levied on each
London club for the 1987/88 season and, for comparison, an estimate
of     what      the     charges       would        have     been     under      the       proposed
arrangements.           It will be seen that almost every club would suffer
a    substantial        increase     in charges,          ranging     from    15%     to   247%   in
1989/90, and between 32% and 334% in 1990/91.


11.     We    understand      that     the       football    clubs    are     aware    that very
substantial       increases are in the pipeline.                      The Met.       also argue,
with some justice, that the clubs suffering the largest increases
are    not     being     penalised,        but     rather    have    been     very     favourably
treated       in the past.           For example,           Millwall,    whose       fans have a
particularly           bad   reputation,           have    enjoyed      far    greater       police
presence       in the ground than they have paid for.                          Increasing the
charge substantially will give them an added incentive to improve
the behaviour of their fans.


Conclusion
12.   The Metropolitan police proposals are in line with government
policy.     They will, however,     undoubtably create protests from the
clubs, who may claim that the policing levels required to promote
crowd safety - especially following the Hillsborough disaster - are
being put out of their reach.


13.   We have no reason to suppose that any club would really be
unable to afford the new charges, but if it poa-
                                               lly appeared that a
club was likely to be faced with bankruptcy, it might be necessary
to ask the Met. not to charge the full^ cost.          This would, however,
be very much a last resort.


14.   It    would   be   sensible   to   clear   the   proposals      with   the
Department of Environment before the Met.           approach the clubs.        A
draft letter for Lord Ferrers to send to the Minister for Sport is
attached.


15.   Ministers are invited to:


      a.     approve the proposals to increase Metropolitan police
             charges for football matches;


      b.     write to the Minister for Sport seeking his agreement.

 ^   METROPOLITAN POLICE CHARGES FOR FOOTBALL MATCHES

w t' . You may be aware that the Metropolitan police have been undertaking
      a review of        the    charges     they   levy    for    football    matches.       As   a
      result of that review, they have asked for Home Office approval for
      increased charges for policing London football matches.


      The    review     has    concluded    that     London      clubs have    been    seriously
     undercharged for their policing, for four main reasons:


              i.      the Metropolitan police often have to supply more
                      officers than are stipulated in the contract with each
                      club;


             ii.      the clubs are charged on the basis that each officer does
                      3 hours' duty, whereas in practice they usually do
                      considerably more;


            111.      no charge is made for the travelling time of officers,
                      despite the fact that this is often considerable, and
                      they are paid for it;


             iv.      officers' time is charged at standard rates (plus a
                      charge for overheads), despite the fact that many of them
                      police football matches on overtime.


      The Metropolitan police              propose    to   remedy points       i.    and   ii.    in
      their        contracts   for   the    1989/90    season,      and   point     iii.   in the
subsequent season, thus phasing the increases.                          They do not propose
to charge for overtime, since the clubs may claim that it would be
possible to arrange police rostas to avoid it (though in practice,
this would be very difficult).


The     new       arrangements     will   lead        to        considerable     increases   in
charges.          In 1989/90 the rises will range from 15% to 247%; and in
1990/91, by between 32% and 3 34%.                The clubs suffering the highest
increases will be those which, like Millwall, have enjoyed but not
paid for very high police presence to control their troublesome
fans.


The Met's proposals are in line with government policy, agreed with
DOE Ministers         in 1984, to recover the full costs of policing the
insides       of    football   grounds.         The    clubs       know that     considerable
rises       are    imminent,   though     I have           no    doubt that there will       be
protests when they are announced.                     The clubs may also claim that
the government is pricing adequate policing out of clubs' pockets,
at the same time as they are urging improved safety in football
grounds.


If there are genuine cases in which clubs are unable to meet the
full     costs,       I    shall   ask    the     Commissioner to              look   atthem
sympathetically; but in general, I fully support the Met's attempts
to     recoup       full    costs.        Apart       from        the   public    expenditure
considerations, there is a strong argument for encouraging football
clubs to improve the behaviour of their fans.                           This may be a good
means of doing it.


The Met. are anxious to get new contracts in place before the start
of    the    new    season,    so there    is very little time.                  I should be
grateful if you could let me              know whether you are contentfor                me to
tell the Met to go ahead.

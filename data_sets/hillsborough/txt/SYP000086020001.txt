           this point I was pased by fans and police officers carrying

           advertising boardings with injured and dead fans on them.                  1 went ov

           to the goal post area where a large group of fans were

           congregating.        I found a large number of Liverpool fans on the floor

           their I could see that some were having breathing difficulties and

           that some appeared dead.          I bega n a dm in iste r ing f irj/t a id to one man

           he was advised about his behaviour.            I continued first aid procedure

           until all the injured fans had been carried out of the ground.                   At 4

           40 pm I left the ground in transit 2 to deal with public order in th

           town centre.

Thank you for your letter of 7 September about Lord Justice
Taylor s recommendations for new criminal offences welcoming my
proposal for introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity.

Turning to your more detailed comments, you made the point that
the touting offence, in the terms expressed by Taylor, might not
prevent touts from selling tickets at neutral grounds. This is
an eventuality which we shall wish to cover if we legislate.
«PJP/ou recognise, football touts need controlling in the
interests of safety and order. I believe a clear and justifiable
distinction can be made between football and other touts which
will enable us to resist any attempts to widen the scope of the
proposed touting offence.

I share your concern that the proposed new offence of running
onto the pitch should include exceptions for safety purposes.
My officials will consult yours about the details of the
proposals.

I am copying this letter to members of QL and H Committees,
Sir Robin Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.

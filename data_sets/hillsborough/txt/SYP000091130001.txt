              I am a married man with one child and I live with my wife at the above

              address.

              On Saturday,     15th April   1989,   I attended the Cup Semi Final      between

              Liverpool and Notts Forrest at Sheffield.          I am a Liverpool      fan and

              have been for 21 years.       During the period prior to the match being

              abandoned I was in my seat in the West Stand.           My mate        ____________ [

              was with me.

              After the game was abandoned am not sure of time.            I went on my own

              to get a drink.      While in the area behind the West Stand and near to

              the tunnel mouth I saw two Police Constables,           carrying a Supporter out

              of the tunnel.      The Supporter appeared to be dead because he had his

              trousers    pulled down and a light brown coat around his face.

              As the Supporter was being carried out there was a Police Sergeant
                                                                             PAGE        i
                                                                             S3539

standing nearby.     I know he was a Sergeant because he was         in full

uniform and he had metal      bar marking on his shoulders.        Because     I

was upset and annoyed at the time 1 said something           like ”Are you happy

now" or i!I suppose y o u 5re happy now",     I can't be sure of rny exact

words to him.

At this the Sergeant just started laughing.

This upset me even more and I stepped forward,          I was not sure why,        but

two men who   I do not know stopped me from going any further.           These 2

guys dragged me away then and another man I know as

d o n ’t know his address,   came up to me.     He calmed me down and then he

went off on his own.      I see           sometimes at the match and 1 will

try and obtain his details,        i e . address and telephone numbers for you,

although I do not know how much of the incident he saw.

I would describe the Sergeant as male, in his late 3 0 ’s/early 4 Q ’s,
^             ..                                            --------------------
5* 1 0/ 11"^tal1, and he had a b lack m o u s t a c h e . He was wearing a long

            r mack which was      loose fitting so I can not give his build

 nd a helmet.    He had a radio on the lapel of this raincoat.            I am not

 ure if 1 saw him again whether        I would recognise him or not.

Myj complaint is that the S e r g e a n t ’s attitude was offensive to me and

 n the circumstances showed a complete         lack of sensitivity or feeling.

I want this complaint fully investigating and if the Sergeant             is

traced and identified I will attend a disciplinary proceeding against

           require any further action to be taken.

to the main e ntrance                   of the R a i l w a y S t a t i o n as the volume             of

time       travel       on any P . S. V w it h the Live rp oo l            S up porters.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1.43     pm that date,         I was     i ns tr u ct e d by    I nspector Dews

The     s upporters were             conveyed to the g round w it h ou t              incident.                I then

    approximately            15.10.

    While we were            handing        the    prisoners          over     to the C u s t o d y O f fi ce r at

    Ecclesfield,            I heard via a Police                   radio      t uned to M a t c h Control           that

    the m a t c h had been st op pe d due to the fact                              that   the    pitch had been

    invaded by Liv er po ol               S up p o r t e r s     from the L e p p i ng s Lane Stand.

    We   i m me di at el y made       our way back                to H i l l s b o r o u g h a r r i v i a n g at Lepp in gs

    Lane      behind the L ep pi ng Lane S ta n d at                        15.25.

    At this       time,      I was    not a ware          of what        had h ap p en e d      inside      the ground.

    I tried to gain a cc es s                via the Lep p in g s Lane entr an ce                   howe ve r the area

    be tw ee n the         stand    itses'lf and the t ur ns t il e s was a b s o l u t e l y                  packed

    full      of supporters,          all      of whom a p p e a r e d         to be e m o t i o n a l l y a f f e c t e d

    and a gg re s s i v e     towards        the Police.

    I made an at te mp t            to get t hroug h the                crowd w it ho ut        success,

    c o n s e qu en tl y    I made my way along                   the outside        of the S o u th S t a n d &

    S p i o n Kop and e nt e r e d the ground at                      the P e n i s t o n e R o a d N o r t h entrance.

    Once      inside       the g round        I went      on to the           pitch.      I saw that P olice

    Of fi ce rs were         forming a cordon a c ro s s                 the    centre      of the        pitch.        On

    reaching        the     cordon    I then saw that                 there were a large              number       of

    persons       laying      on the g round at the                   rear of the L e p p i ng s Lane goal

    post.        I went      s traight       to this           loca ti on and        it was     only on my arrival

    that      I could see          that     these      persons were            in fact      dead.         I walked

    a r o u n d the area       of the         pitch near to the L ep p in g s Lane                    end to see             if

    there was a n y t h i n g        I could do to aa/ist                     but there w a s n ’t.          It was at

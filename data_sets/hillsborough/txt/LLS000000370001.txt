Hillsborough 15 April 1989



I andtwo friends:: set off to Sheffield at approximately 9.30 a.m.         The route

to Hillsborough was quite easy because the roads were quite empty due to

time we had set off.



Finally, after much searching for a car space we arrived just outside the

ground in a backstreet it was about 11.30 to 11.45 a.m, so we decided to

eat some of our packed lunch.       After that we decided to look around the

area, as it was at least three hours to Kick off we decided to go for a

drink.



Due      to the presence of Liverpool    fans, pubs near   the ground    were closed

but      after walking up a long road we found a pub, the Horse         and Jockey.

Being a warm day, the pub was packed and many people were sat outside drinking

peacefully and laughing and joking.



At the pub I had exactly two pints of lager, my girlfriend just two halves

of lager and my other friend two pints of Bitter.       We were at the pub approximately

one hour.     The time now was about 1.15 p.m.     We then went back to the car

to have somthing to eat and listen to the radio and generally relax before

the       game.   About 1.45 to 2.00 p.m. we decided to go to the ground early

in order to get a good position.        After a visit   to the toilet, I met some

friends outside     the ground who had travelled up to Sheffield separately.

After talking to them the friends I travelled up with and           myself decided

to go into the ground.    It was now about 2.10 - 2.15 p.m.



We approached the turnstiles which were quite empty, we went to our special

turnstile and handed my ticket over to the steward who ripped it and I was
 allowed in,     I walked past several police officers but not one checked ine

 in case I had anything harmful - luckily I did not.



We bought    our programmes and proceeded to the Le ppings Lane Terrace,          as

 I had been last year.     I made my way to the front directly behind the goal

 and found an empty space and settled there, the terrace was quite full and

 I started to read my programne.   The time was about 2.25 to 2.35 p.m.



The usual singing started and the crowds began to move forward but              soon

pulled back.      The teams had been out warming up and gone in and more people

began to come in and it was quite       full.      I looked at the clock for the

final time it was 2.48 a.m.    More people began to flood in.



The players ran out, Liverpool followed by Nottingham Forest.          The Captins

were called.      Then the crush started,       I was separated from my girlfiend

and was thrown to the fence, I was directly in the fence behind the goal,

I though it was just the normal crush which is canmon before the start of

any big game.

                                                                            >




But   this was   longer and more painful    I could hear screams of "Help" and

"I can't breath" The people on the fence were shouting at            the police to

open the gates but the police just      looked at us telling us not to panic,

the screams were louder "I can't breath", "Help".       Some people climbed above

me and got over the fence but were pushed back by police.       Finally the police

realising that something was wrong helped people get over and the area behind

the goal was crowded, but the screams get louder.



Every face I saw I shouted to "Help, get me out please".            The crush now

was terrific.     I could hardly breath, I stopped shouting in order to save

breath,   I managed to put my mouth through one of        the gaps of the fence,

the wire was      right on ny mouth.   I just     told nyself   to keep breathing.
deep and long and not        to panic.       Don't panic. The people behind the goal

on the pitch were lying on the ground the police and St Johns were by them

people were shouting at the police telling them to get people out.



I could hear screams louder with panic I just told nyself don't panic, ny

ribs,    legs were killing the pain just would'nt go "Help" I shouted at one

person but he did'nt hear me.        I realised that I could'nt see |        |(ny girlfriend)

I tried to get over the fence and then I would look for her,                 I tried to

haul nyself up but I just could'nt move, only ny right arm, people all around

me were screaming, panic was evident in their voices.            People around directly

behind me started climbing over the fence,               I then saw      , I managed to

drag her towards me how I don't know.



Her     facewas white, she said to me "I'm tired,           I want to go    to sleep" I

told her to face the fence and breath deeply putting               her face to the wire.

She     said    "I   can't breath"       I    told her    to take deepbreaths deep    breaths.

She     tried   but complained of        a    pain in her chest.



The screams, were loud and panic were everywhere. I could hear a lad'svoice

screaming, he must have been about a few metres away but I just could'nt

reach him.      I don't know if he got out alive.             Lisa and myself were now

close together.       I was thinking deep breaths,         it will be over in a minute

and tellingl         Ithe same,   the whole pitch was covered with people, I started

to move back but I was not moving very far, people were standing with police

on the fence hauling people out              the fence began to wobble and shake and

I feared it was going to collapse on top of me.               More and more people were

getting in to the pitch.


I started to move back in a hope that I could get out of the way I came

in as I moved back the crush was almost easing.                Many people were on the

pitch all I could see was people lying on the pitch with St. Johns and police

trying to help.
I told         that we could probably get out so I turned her around, on the

terrace floor there was people just lying dead, blue covered in footprints,

to the left of me people were trying to give a dying person the kiss of

life.          started to scream,       I told her to calm down.   I was scared.

I felt a terrible feeling in my stomach but I said to              "Just keep going

out come on, come on."



As we progressed up        the terrace,   there were more dead bodies,   people at

the top seeing us dragges            and nyself under the bar and we finally made

it to the tunnell and looked back to the pitch.           I could hear the public

address system but I could'nt understand it.



We got out into the yard and I stopped to see an ambulance pull in I took

        towards it who was still shaking and saying       "I can't breath" I told

her that we would be alright now.         We got into the ambulance, and told the

man inside what was wrong, he strapped              down, and I said to him that

I would stand as not to take a place, we were ready to go when I saw a man

shout at the ambulance and then collapse.          I think he had a heart attack.

I told        we better get out as he was more critical we left the ambulance

and started to leave the ground.



Then a nurse came up to us, asked if we were alright, I told him about

he   told       to take deep breaths,      and relax, he enquired about me but I

told him that by now I was alright but I had a pain in ny chest.             After

the murse had treated            we walked well away from the ground and I sat,

        down telling her    to relax.     Three girls came over and asked how we

were I asked if they could look           after her while I went ot look for the

las (        we travelled with and my other mates I'd seen outside.



As I approached the ground, I was told that in no uncertain terms to leave

by a police officer,       I just walked away not wanting to start any trouble.

Another police officer told me to wait over by a wall away from the ground.
I spotted a few of them but not all including            I then wandered about.

with ny face streaked with blood and tears I then went back to               and

the girls and told them the situation and I went        to look for         then

I spotted him and he told me that hewas okay and to go back to the car with

him where       |was.   As we waited outside, a woman came to the car and asked

us did we want a drink or use       the phone.   We went in to her house,

had a wash and          and I used the phone we phoned home and told them we

were alright just bruised and shocked and we would be home as soon as possible

We then thanked the woman and got in the car and started to go home.



On the way home,   the car was silent just listening to the radio,       finally

we arrived •home and         went   to his family and I drove         s car back

to our house.    We got home and met our family.       The time was about 7.45

p.m. to 8.00 O'clock.

Hillsborough 15 April 1989



We left home, my boyfriend            and a friend |
                                                   ____ |at 9.30 in the morning

and arrived in Sheffield at about 11.30 but by the time we found a parking

space near the ground it was about 11.45.         We stayed in the car and ate

some of our packed lunches.      We   then went   to a pub called the Horse and

Jockey.    The pub was   packed but the weather waS nice so we drank our drink

outside.    We left the pub between 1.15 p.m. and 1.30.p.m and went back to

the car to finish our packed lunch and we sat listening to the car radio,

after about half an hour we made our way          to the    football ground stopping

to talk to some friends on the way.



We went into the Leppings Lane Entrance, we were not checked but one police

officer did ask me if I had a handbag.        We all bought a prograirme visited

the toilet then walked through the tunnell and into the ground it was then

about 2.15. p..m.    In a slight push. I lost my. shoes which were given back

 to me.    We went to the front behind the goal where I could see the pitch

some lads    at the back had a beach ball which            was being hitabout until it

went onto    the pitch, we asked a policeman to throw it back            be he would'nt

but a photographer did the ball was then knocked into the other enclosures.

By this time the players had been out to look at the pitch                and gone back

 in and the teams players were being named it was about 2.50 p.m.            The ground

was getting packed and some pushing started we thought this normal at first

 about five minutes later a great big push came and it got worse and I was

 pushed up against the fence at the fron I lost                 and        in the push,

 people were screaming behind me        and asking   the police       to open the gates

 at the back.    I could not move       andmove people were getting crushed.          I

 asked a policemand to help me as it       was hurting me he told me not panick.

 Some boys climbed over the tops        butwere pushed back in by the police who
were nagging all the time.       I was right up against the fence and could not

climb over people were standing on my head and shoulders to climb over the

fence.     I saw a little boy near me slide     down the railings to the     ground

and heard another boy asking      a policeman to get his mate out who was trapped

at the front.    I was fighting for breath and my fingers were bleeding through

holding on to the railings,        a lad next to me kept shouting at me      not    to

panick and keep taking deed       breaths and we would be able to get out soon.

This seemed to go on for a long time I thought I was not going to get out

I knew I was standing on people.       I then heard         shouting me but I

did not know where he was I then found he was behind me he grabbed hold

of me and held me up in some reason the crushing seemed to ease off and

         was able to turn me round and he and the other lad were able to push

back and then they found they could get me out         .         grabbed hold of

me and threw me backwards with the help of the other lad who had hold of

me with          . 1   started screaming because of the dead bodies laying on

the ground but         told me to get under a bar quick but I did not understand

I suddenly felt iqy head being pushed dcwn aid Iwasbein 3 dragged along by my

hair          then pushed me up the stairs with the help of other people.

There was still people screaming behind me.       We got out through the tunnel

entrance a St Johns Ambulance man walked with me and I             the man undid

my shirt    so I could breath I was then put     into an ambulance another man

was strapped down in the ambulance they then started to strap me down.

A man came up to the back of the ambulance I think he died of a heart attack

so it was better he went with the ambulance instead of me as my breathing

was better as I left the ambulance a man grabbed hold of me and sat me down

he said he was a doctor and was pushing me head between my legs and telling

me to take deep breaths.             saw I was okay then he went back to look

for           I must have been    sitting there for a while when I saw             who

put his arm around me and said thank god your alive we both were crying

when he asked where          was I told him           was looking for him.

picked me up and said that we were going back to the car.            was sitting

me in the car when a women came up tp me and took me to her house where
ue washed    the blood off me from my hands and face then |         |came with

       The woman let us use her phone to ring our mum and dad to tell them

we were alright.     We then got into I     I car and went home.   When we got

home I saw my mum and dad waiting for me we all cried when I said I did nt

think I would see them again.     My mum then put me into the bath and after

washing me she     called my dad up to see the marks on me they got me dressed

and took me to the hospital because ray left arm, -knees and hands were swollen

and my chest and head hurt.      I was x-rayed and the Doctor told them there

was nothin broken but I was badly bruised and     I needed rest.   Mum and dad

sat with me Saturday and Sunday night because I did not sleep I could still

hear people screaming and seeing the dead bodies and I did not know if all

our friends had got home.

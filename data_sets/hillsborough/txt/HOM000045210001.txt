MEMORANDUM


From: C F BONE
      Room 1106
      0171 273 2512


Date:        17 September 1997

To:        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




                    Si   /




I attach

                  the statements which you asked for by SEAMAN, EASTWOOD, and
                  MACKRELL (copied from the material on the Public Record Office files of
                  Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry);

                  PRO file HO 397/74, which contains the statement by BOWNES; and

                  a copy of what seems to be the bundle of agreed documents at Taylor’s Inquiry
                  (borrowed from the Treasury Solicitors).

You said that transcripts for day 1 and day 2 of Taylor were missing from the PRO files you
have. I do not know why that should be - they ought to be with you, and we do not have
them here. Would you like me to get them from somewhere else?

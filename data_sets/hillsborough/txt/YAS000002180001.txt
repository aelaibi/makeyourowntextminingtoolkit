                  states:-



1.   I was born on 8th February 1944.



2.   I joined the Sheffield Corporation Ambulance Services

     at Corporation Street,        Sheffield,       leaving in 1973 to join

     Longley Ambulance Station where I am now based.

3.   I am    a   qualified     ambulance    man.         I    have    attended    and

     obtained the Miller certificate following completion of the
     compulsory residential course.               I have since received in-
     house training and attended refresher courses.



4.   On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was not due to report for duty
     until 2200 hours.         I was on the night shift working from
     2200 hours through to 0600 hours the following morning.



5.   I was   watching     television       at    home    on    the    afternoon   of

     Saturday     15 th when    I saw the TV report             the    incident   at

     Hillsborough Football Ground.              I realised immediately that

     there was a major incident.            I tried to contact control by
     telephone.     I was unable to get through as all the telephone

     lines were busy.        I left home and drove to Longley Ambulance

     Station.       I   arrived    at    Longley        Ambulance      Station    at

     approximately      1520    hours.      I used       the    direct     line   to
     control.     This line was busy.           I listened to control on the
     radio receiving equipment at Longley Station.                    I was joined

     by                 and I radioed to control that I was taking a
vehicle   to    Hillsborough.         I   spoke   to                       who

confirmed that I should do that.



                    and I each took a vehicle.          The vehicle I took
was a day vehicle and I booked out of the station.                       I was

listening      to    the messages     from control       which     I did   not

acknowledge, I simply proceeded to Hillsborough.                   I was told

to proceed to the gate on Peni stone Road and was told that

it was the casualty clearing point.               I switched to the ERC

channel and was unable to make contact because of static.                    I
returned to channel 2 on which I could receive messages.


I drove down Herries Road South.             There were problems with

the   radio.         I drove   into    Penistone       Road   to   the   first
entrance on the left.          I parked the vehicle which had call

sign S403.      I went into the area adjacent to the gymnasium
where I was met by an ambulanceman from Middlewood Ambulance

Station   (name                       ) who had    a    patient     that   was

bleeding heavily.        At this time a policeman asked me to move

my vehicle to let another vehicle in the ground get clear.

The traffic was being marshalled by the police.                    There were

many people screaming for attention.              I stayed with the man

from Middlewood Ambulance Station and we loaded the casualty

onto the ambulance.        Once the casualty was loaded into a cot

cardiac pulmonary respiration techniques were applied as was
a bag and mask to help the casualty breath.
8.            who told me he was running short of airways.                   I gave
      him half my supply of airways.               The scene which greeted me

      on arrival was a mass of fans, many in shock and many people

      moving around in a confined area.                I saw           who told me

      that    the priority was to clear serious casualties.                       The

      situation about me seemed chaotic.              I do not know who was in

      control.        I did   not   see      any   senior    officers     from    the
      ambulance service although I did see senior police officers.

      There    were   some    police   vehicles       parked      adjacent   to   the
      gymnasium which        I considered to be an hinderance to the

      casualty    clearing     operation.          There   were    many   vehicles,

      emergency vehicles and police vehicles parked in Penistone

      Road and the gym area which made access and exit from the

      ground very difficult.



      I saw Trevor Dale who then gave the keys to the vehicle to a
      police officer and told him to drive.                       was carrying out

      cardiac pulmonary respiration and I was using the bag and

      mask to keep the casualty breathing.                 I considered the age

      of   the casualty to be between              12 and    15 years old.          I

      thought the casualty was dead.               The journey to the Northern
      General Hospital was via Penistone Road and Herries Road and

      not Herries Road South and throughout                       and I continued

      cardiac pulmonary respiration and bag and mask techniques

      although there was no improvement in the patient.


10.   We did not have a minute man on board the ambulance.                        Day




                                          til tJ
vehicles do not usually carry minute men.



In the back of the vehicle travelling to the hospital there

were three people;            a policeman,                         and    I.

policeman       was   driving.        He    was    inexperienced        and    had

obviously not had much experience of driving ambulances.                        It

was    very     difficult    to    work    on   the    patient     as   we    were
constantly being thrown around in the rear of the vehicle.



I was aware from the outset that I was attending a major

incident.       I had heard control on the radio also say that
the    situation at Hillsborough had been                    declared   a major
incident.



The journey to the hospital was rough.                  It was conducted at
high speed.       I have no idea if we had a police escort, I was

too busy attending the young boy and the only time I looked

out of the vehicle window was when I had picked myself up
off my knees after a near miss.



The    driver    of   the   vehicle       was   complaining      how    bad    the

traffic was and I was continuing to ask                                      if we

were getting a response.           I should estimate the journey took
5 or 10 minutes.       The traffic was bad and we drove into the

Barnsley Road entrance.            There was a bottleneck of traffic

into   the    Barnsley      Road   entrance       of   the    hospital.        The
casualty department was in chaos.                 Doctors and nurses were
screaming that they could not take any more patients.                       A

doctor was requesting someone to tell control not to send
any more casualties to the Northern General Hospital and

suggested    they   should    all   be    redirected         to   the   Royal
Hallamshire.



Our vehicle was parked in the yard because there were so

many vehicles waiting for casualty.               Once a vehicle moved

away from casualty our vehicle reversed into a bay and we

unloaded a patient into casualty.             A doctor examined the boy
and declared him dead on arrival.              We took the body to the

plaster room, the temporary mortuary at the hospital.



I tried to contact control on returning to to our vehicle.
I eventually contacted control who told me to return to
Hillsborough.    At this stage I do not remember who was in
the vehicle with me.



I drove to Hillsborough using Herries Road South which was

clear.   There was a policeman on every junction.                 I entered

Penistone Road and was directed by police into a queue of

ambulances waiting to gain access to the football ground.

My return journey had been very swift.               The police had kept
the road very clear.



I waited    probably   10    minutes     in    the   queue    and   Station

Officer Paul Eason then told me to pull in very close to a
      police vehicle and station officer                          stood in the
      road directing traffic around me.        I parked the vehicle as
      directed and I was told by Station Officer Eason to remove

      two cots.      I unloaded the cots.       I had the keys to the

      vehicle I handed the cots to a fireman in the gymnasium
      area.


19.   An injured boy had been placed on the vehicle and I was told
      to take him to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.              I grabbed an

      assistant _____________ who was my attendant on the journey.

      A policeman offered assistance and climbed in.               I was being

      harassed to move the ambulance because a police emergency
      vehicle wished to pass me.


2 0 . As I drove down Leppings Lane a huge crowd of people were at

      a junction in the road.           The police traffic controllers

      waived me through the traffic lights and progress towards
      the   Royal   Hallamshire   was    reasonably    good   although      the

      traffic was very heavy, particularly at Hillsborough corner.

      I moved as best I could through the traffic and the journey

      took me 10 or 15 minutes.     I realised quite early on that I

      was in the front of a convoy of several ambulances together

      with police vehicles providing escorts.


21.   On arrival at the Royal Hallamshire the casualty department

      was well organised and was accepting casualties into the
      orthopaedic   area.   The doctors      were     able   to    assist   the
casualties very quickly.



There were a lot of people on hand at the Royal Hallamshire
to give us assistance.



I handed over the casualty at the Royal Hallamshire and
reported to control that I was clear.             I was asked to switch

to channel 4 and told to stand by on the Netherthorpe Road
dual carriageway.



I joined a queue of 4 or 5 ambulances and others pulled in

behind me.      I waited there for a while.                  There were St.

John's Ambulance people and Red Cross ambulance people in
the area too.



I contacted     control    and     tried   to   find
reported to control that                        was with me and acting
as attendant.



Control directed me to the Royal Hallamshire to transfer

patients from there to the King Edward Hospital.



I   returned    to   the   Royal    Hallamshire        and    met

          the Standards and Efficiency Officer, who was co­
ordinating operations at the Hallamshire.               She was the only

officer that I saw at the Royal Hallamshire.                  Whilst at the

Royal   Hallamshire we were         approached    by    the    press.   We
      refused     to    answer    questions      and      told    them    to     seek     any
      information they wanted from a senior officer.



28.   A     police    officer    told   us    that     only       one    third       of   the

      policemen on duty had radios at the Hillsborough Football

      Ground.        The radios are apparently only issued to men on an
      8 hour shift.



29.   The patients were collected from the Hallamshire and the

      police constable (named John) gave a hand to load.                             We had
      four patients who were to be transferred to the King Edward
      hospital.



30.   The patients were handed over and I reported to control.

      Control ordered us to return to base.                      I believe the time

      was now about 1930 or 1945 hours.


31.   I   requested      permission      to   go     to    the     Northern      General
      Hospital.        The police constable with us wanted to collect

      equipment from the hospital.             Control requested that on our

      attendance we should collect a patient from the Northern
      General     Hospital      and   transfer      the    patient       to    the    Royal

      Hallamshire CT scan unit.


32.   We attended the Northern General Hospital and dropped off

      the    police     constable     who    went    to    a     police   car        in   the

      grounds.
33.           and I collected the patient.     We were originally told

        to   collect   patient      however,   we   eventually   collected

        patient number           The patient was    loaded with a     full
        medical   CT   scan crew including a doctor,     a nurse    and a

        sister.   The patient was about 15 years of age and he was

        transferred to the Royal Hallamshire.


34.     We had a trouble free journey to the Royal Hallamshire.       The

        patient was delivered to transit and transferred to one of

        the Royal Hallamshire cots and handed over.         I waited for
        the doctor, nurse and sister to return to the vehicle before

        returning to the Northern General Hospital.         On return I

        called control who ordered me to return to base.


35.     I returned to base at approximately 2230 hours and left the

        base at 2235 or 2240 hours.


36.     I am aware of the major incident plan and procedures.        I am

        not aware of any major incident plan for the Hillsborough

        Football Ground.

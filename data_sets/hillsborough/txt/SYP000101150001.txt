            On S a t u r d a y ,     15 April,          1989     <150489)       I came        on duty    in u n i f o r m at

            Main Street            Po l i c e Station,           in order       to work        the FA Semi           Final     match

            at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,    Sheffield.          I was     briefed        before     leaving M a i n Street,

            by h a v i n g     sight       of    the football          order,        that     I was on P o l i c e         S e r geant

            On arrival            at H i l l s b o r o u g h my serial          attended        the m a t c h    briefing          in

            the N o r t h      stand,       and then went as a w h o l e                serial      to W a d s l e y Bri d g e

            Station,         arriving           there at a p p r o x i m a t e l y     11am     (1100).         I cannot          be

            specific         a bout      the time as at that                  time    I had no s i g n i f i c a n t        reason

            to    remember         it.      I can       remember       thinking        that     g iven there was              only

            one    special         t rain a r r i v i n g      s h o r t l y a f t e r Ep m    <1400),    that        our

            deployment            there     so e a r l y was        perhaps      not    the best        use     of the

            serial.          H o w e v e r an d     perhaps as was             in fact        intended the           serial       was

           able       to    pay a t t e n t i o n to fans           on H a l i f a x Road.

            I can        recall      the    public       house a d j a c e n t       to the     station,        (towards          the

boarding across                  the windows.              I do not      recall       seeing anyone',             apart

from         possibly         the    licensees,          formally       entering       or   leaving the             pub at

the         rear.       This was          not    the    case at the          public house         on the        opposite

side        of    the Hali f a x         Roa d f rom the S t a t i o n entrance.                  At the        side     of

that         pub a      road was          used for       the    parking       of hire vans,          some       being

use d by P o l i c e           serials.           I do not k now         if a n y were        fans’ 'buses’.

Tha t       pub was also             boar d e d up but          the    licensee was a d m i t t i n g           fans.         At

some        time a r o u n d m i d d a y he a s k e d           our    serial,       I do not k now who

though,           if a couple            of bobb i e s      could      stand w ith him at the                 rear     of

his     pub to help him                   ’select'       who    he was       going    to admit.          The      pub at

this        time     s e e m e d quite          full    of football          supporters,       noisy      but £juite

controllable               by the         licensee a n d his staff.                  I stayed w i t h him for

about         10 m i n u t e s      but g iven that            there was anot h e r         serial       at     that     side

of the           road,     i m m e d i a t e l y outs i d e     the    pub,    our serial         and a n o t h e r      by

Wadsley Bridge Station                          I did not see          the    point    in a c t i n g as a bouncer

for     him a n d        returned          to my serial.              I was    not a ware      until      leaving

that        area     i m m e d i a t e l y before 3 p m         (1500)       that he had a n y p r o b l e m s wit h

drunken           cus t o m e r s       and also       cannot     say    if the       licensee      ever        req u e s t e d

Police assistance                       other than that d e s c r i b e d above.

From        the     time      of gett i n g       to W a d s l e y B r i d g e S t a t i o n w h i c h was well

b e f o r e midday,            there was a st e a d y            str e a m of L i v e r p o o l    fans       he ad i n g

to w a r d s      the    ground.           However,       a small       number       then came back             in the

opposite            direction           heading a w a y        from the ground.             I cannot give

numbers           but    as    is usual w i t h          these du t i e s my a t t e n t i o n was            d r a w n more

to the m o r e           noisy          fans.      B e f o r e 2p m   (1400)     a n y sick conduct,              g iven

the     o c c asion,          was       quite a c c e p t a b l e an d only the          odd few w ere           advised

quite        gently        to save         their       singing    voices       for    the m a t c h etc.

I can        recall        du r i n g    the time        spent at W a d s l e y B r i d g e       some    fans

shouting            towards         others a bout         'spare      tickets',        in p a r t i c u l a r    one     tall

Above Wadlsey Bridge Station                       is a small         industrial        estate       of shops,

K i l n e r Way.       The      first     stop on      it is a supermarket.                  Towards     the

Sheffield        side      of that        road and      outside       the s u p e r m a r k e t    itself are

g r a s s e d areas.         As    time moved        on t o w a r d the     start      of the match,            and

c e r t a i n l y from     1pm     (1300)      onwards      these areas were            quite       l i terally

covered w i t h y oung men sat                  drinking      from      cans and       plastic       bottles.

The    favourite         quantity         seemed     to be    '4*     packs      of   cans,       although

* 6 ’ packs a n d        *12*      packs were        not   uncommon.          Nor were the 2 and 3
                                                                                                                /'
litre    bottles.            Again       before 2 p m      (1400)     they were        not    causing a

public       order     problem.

Their    c o n c e r n for        the     litter     laws did        leave a     lot to be d e s i r e d as           on

e m p tying a      can     it     was     simply d r o p p e d on the       floor.        On at      least one

occasion       b oth m y s e l f and         other     o f f icers    b e l i e v e d a can had been

t h r o w n at us,       but      what was h a p p e n i n g as       time m o v e d on was        so m a n y

cans were        rolling          a b o u t and onto       the road vehicles             were      kicking them

up w h e n    pass i n g     over     them.       In all     f a i rness    I must      put       down that      by

far    the m a j o r i t y were          simply e n j o y i n g   a drink,        in the      pleasant

 falling          over,      they       can get       in.        Only      the     blatently         obvious        drunks are

going        to    be a r r e s t e d at/or           in the ground.

So,     as a n o p i nion,              fans    have       readily        e x p l o i t e d the w e a k n e s s and

 provided          the y     travel        early      enough        there         is e v e r y    opportunity            for the m

to     drink       considerable             a m o unts,      if t h e y       so wish,           before      going       onto    the

whether           t h e y ae     drunk      or not         and     the    pra c t i c a l    difficulties              of

arrests           in that        situation.

Having        o u t l i n e d my t h o u g h t s       on e v e n t s       prior        to 2 p m    (1400),        I will       now

deal    with        events        after        2 pro (1400).

By    this        time     the    grassed areas              near        to K i l n e r W a y were           completely

full    of y o u t h s         sat d r i nking.             My    lowest         estimate        of nu m b e r      w o u l d be

500    in that           area.         Again       generally          good       humoured and             r e a l l y o nly

required monitoring                      by P o l i c e .        Shortly         after 2 p m < 1400),            the    single

special           train arrived.                My    feeling,           shared       to a man,           by m y serial

was    that       t hese       supporters            frankly        did     not     need a P o l i c e          escort.         T here

was a     broad          range        of ages        and    their        cond u c t w o u l d       not    have     gone      out

At all        times        there       se e m e d to      be     a steady                stream.

would     expect           a group         outsid e       a nightclub,                  there was        not a       rush in

discarded           empty drink              containers.

Before        this       I can       recall      a number            of m e n       obviously desperate                    for a

toilet        asking         us w h e r e     there wa s         a     pu b l i c    toilet.          I would         be

surprised           if     that      was     due to d r i n k i n g          a ther m o s       flask.          There        was    no

obvious          place,        out    of sight           of a     po l i c e      offier at        least,        to    go     to

grou n d .         Not     just      ones     or twos          but     still        small      groups.          We    had

anticipated              meeting        up w i t h     the      rest        of    our    serial,       whom      we    felt

would     leave          the      outside      of the         ground         for     meal      shortly after               kick-off.

Before any            of     us    could meal         we       received           the m e s s a g e     to a t t e n d       the

 I did      not     k n o w at     that      point w h a t      was      happening           inside       the       g r o u n d and

my    obvious        first       thoughts        was    crowd       trouble.

On    arrival        at    the g r o u n d      it was      frankly           impossible           to f ind         out what

was    happening.             Initially           I formed        part        of a cordon o u t s i d e              the    gates

on    the     corner       of L e p p i n g s    Lane      it s e l f    with        other      officers         there.          The

intention was              to a l l o w exit         but    not     entry.            That      only    l a s t e d a few

minutes        as a m b u l a n c e s      began arriving               and    the n the         fire     s e r vice.

Myself        a n d PC B r i c k l e y       took    it u p o n     oursleves             to direct        ambulances             in

towards        the     road      running a r o u n d        the     rear       of     the ground.              By    this     time

I had       gathered        that      there were           a number           of     injuries       f rom w i t h i n       the

West     stand and          I b e l i e v e d at       that     time      casualties were                 co m i n g      from out

of    the     back     of the        stand.

I did       not    know     the      s cale     of what       was       happening           inside      the      ground.          As

the    fire       s e r v i c e a r r i v e d we     tried     to       'park*        them so as          to     leave      the

entrance          clear.

As    fans w e r e        leaving       I can       remember        a nu m b e r         being a b u s i v e        t o w a r d s me   /
and    other       off i c e r s .      However        this     conduct            was    that     born    out       of fear

and    not     through        loutish         behaviour.            It w a s        impossible          to a n s w e r      the

many     comments,          including           " Y o u ’ve k i l l e d m y m a t e s           in t h e r e "       " This      is

all    th e    bloody Police's                fault"        nor w a s         it the       time     to do        so.

It w a s      really      only w h e n        I saw the        group          of 8 - 1 0 bod i e s        laid       on the

ground,        behind makeshift                 screens,       tha t      I k new         the    scale     of       the

disaster          (although          the     first     time     I knew         the       final     numbers was             some 3

hours       later      via a local            radio     broadcast).

             advice was that it had obviously incensed some fans and he should

             consider his own safety.   I left him at the other end of Vere Road.

             I did notice people on that road opening their doors to Liverpool fans.

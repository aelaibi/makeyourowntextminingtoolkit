BIG RON IS BACK
LWERPOOL-BORN      Ron Atkinson has travelled thousands
 of miles during his career as a Soccer manager, and now
he’s been handed the job of trying to steer Sheffield
Wednesday clear of relegation. After joining Aston Villa
in 1956, he moved to Oxford and, between 1962 and 1971,
he made 400 League appearances for them. He finished
his playing career at Kettering, became their manager, then
took charge at Cambridge and steered them to the Fourth
Division championship.
  Then it was on again, first to West Brom, and north next
to Manchester United. He joined them in 1981 and, under
his guidance, United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985.
Last season he returned to West Brom at a time when they
were struggling, and he managed to keep them in the
Second Division, then embarked upon that short-lived
career with Atletico Madrid, despite having taken the
Spanish club from near the foot of the table to third from
top. However, he wasn’t idle long, because Wednesday
named him as their manager on February 15, only a matter
of weeks after h~s return from Spain~
   He quickly appointed Richie Barker as his No.2, and in
doing so he recruited a wealth of backroom experience,
for Richie--who played for Derby County, Notts. County
and Peterborough United--has managed Shrewsbury Town, Stoke
City and Notts. County, and was in charge of Greek-club Ethnikos
for a year, then had an 18-month spell in Egypt. He joined
Wednesday from Luton Town, where he passed up the chance of
going to Wembley with them for the final of the Littlewoods Cup.



LIKE Ron Atkinson, David Hodgson (pictured below) had p[oblems
when he opted for a move to Spain. In fact, his spell with Cadiz ended
with his taking the club to court.., and winning his case, "1 didn’t
learn a thing about football, but it was a very valuable growing-up
exercise," was how he summed up that period in his career. ’For
four months I trained on my own, so I had plenty of time to sort
myself out."
   In the six years which have elapsed since he first pulled on a
Liverpool jersey, he has sampled just about everything football has
to offer--including the lows, as well as the hig,h,s. And not long ago,
in a very frank assessment, he reflected that ’my biggest mistake
was leaving Anfield... after that; I let my standards drop. I stopped
doing t,he things I was good at--I wasn’t concentrating:"
   David s first season at Liverpool, after his half-million pound move
from Middlesbrough, ended with his having a League-championship
medal to show for his efforts; but after this he found that nailing
down a regular first-team spot
was easier said than done. He
said later: "1 was in the reserves
and thought I should have been
in the first team.., t realise now
that if you’re doing the business
for Liverpool, you’llbe picked for
the senior side."
   After Anfield, Sunderland and
Norwich City were the next stops,
then David opted for a move to
the Continent, with Cadiz. When
he came back to this country, it
was Sheffield Wednesday who
signed him on a free transfer, and
he rated himself "very luckyto be
~tiven
  ight.,a, second chance in the top
   Naturally, he’ll be ho, ping that
he is in Wednesdays line-up
against Liverpool today, and
everyone at Anfietd will wish him
all the best in his bid to boos$ his
career again. :. except, of course,
when he’s in action against Us!

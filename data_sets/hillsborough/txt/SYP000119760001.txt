At    this time       there w e r e onl y a s m a l 1 number of fans                in the    immed ia te

escort fans to our control                    a r e a , the g y m n a s i u m exit gate    'B * had to

be opened to a l l o w us through.

Although,       du e to the w ork b eing c a r r i e d o u t , I was u n a w a r e of time

We went      through exit gate               'B ' to get to the gy mnasium,            at this time the

The pe r i m e t e r gat e       I wa s at was shut after a struggle,                       the    idea b eing

that     if all      the p e r i m e t e r gates w e r e        s h u t , the crush by the

by n o w g e t t i n g v e r y    i r a t e , s h o u t i n g and some h u r l i n g a buse        towards us.

Unfortun at el y,         it cou ld be see n that there w e r e a number of y o u n g

children       in this cro wd ou tside the gat es and I feared for their safety.

I m m e d i a t e l y to m y right was a w r o u g h t           iron fence f o l l o w e d by a

further       two g a t e s w h i c h ha d bee n shut by the M o u n t e d O f f i c e r s .                The

the ground after b e i n g i n structed on w h e r e                     they sho ul d b e .

At one p oint I a l l o w e d m y p e r i m e t e r gat e to be op e n e d to a l l o w a

a surge.         I w a s u n a b l e to hol d the ga te s h u t , but mad e sure that I

w a s pushed b e h i n d the fe ncing to m y r i g h t .                  At this poi nt          I was

fearful      for m y ow n saf e t y but there was a gre at er fear for

s u p p o r t e r s ' sa f e t y as they cr ushed thro u g h the g a t e .                Somehow I

m a n a g e d to shut the gate again,                  but    I n c r e a s i n g l y m o r e and m o r e fans

that was for the fans at the L e p p i n g s Lane end to stop p u s h i n g .

Believing     it was a m e s s a g e for those o u t s i d e , I th ought             that    it was a

            I commenced duty at 8.30 a.m.                      at H ac ke nt h or p e Police Station.                        I was

            instructed at this              point    that      I was      to be working               in serial        16 under

            Sergeant         1288 Payne.        From H ac ke nt h or p e we were                   t ra ns po rt ed    to

            H i l l s b o r o u g h Football    Gro un d by transport                provided.

            On my arrival           at the football            stadium at about 9 . a.m.                    there was         no

            evidence         of any supporters and once                   inside       generally w ai te d             for the

            briefing         to be held at 9.55 a.m.                 in the North Stand.

            As   I was       sat    in the North S tand awaiting                   the briefing             1' was

            instructed that              in general       charge      of serial          16 was        to be     Inspector

            Purdy.

            During     the briefing          the    instructions            for    serial          16 was    to work

outside      of the    turnstiles.        The    time now was a p p r o x i m at e ly      11.15 a.m.

a lt h o u g h the turnstile s w e r e n ’t due to be opened until                  11.45 a.m.        I

was working         in company with Police Con st ab le              115 H u c k s t ep p at   turnstile

*A * .

At this time         there were only a small            number of fans          in the     immediate

vicinity.          Eve n when the turnstiles were             open there were            only a small

number      of Liverpool       fans entering.         The mood at this time was                happy

with many fans         joking with us, at this             time     it was     possible    to search

every      person entering       through        our turnstile.          However,    as    time went

on it was         very noticeable       to me that a lt ho u gh there were an

increasing         number    of fans arriving,        many were         choosing    to sit outside

the    ground or stand away from the               ground at Leppings Lane,                even at

this      point it only a pp ea re d to be a          ' n o r m a l ’ match.

It was      noticeable       though that when a prisoner                needed escorting to the

g ym gn a si um area,       it meant    two     men leaving       the    turnstile area. To

escort      fans    to our    control   area,     the gym na si um exit-gate             ’8 ’ had to

be opened to a llow us through.

Although,         due to the work       being    carried     out,    I was     unaware     of time

throughout,         I believe at about 2.15           p.m.    I escorted a Liverpool             fan

to the gyn ma si um he had had his ticket                  stolen and only          possessed the

ticket      stub.

We went      through exit gate          ’B ’ to get to the gymnasium,               at this     time the

crowd outside was            still   growing,     although     people were         still    jovial

and      it was    still    in order to search vir tu al ly every person                   entering

the ground.

It had been a surprise               to see the    number     of Liverpool         fans who     had

tried to get         into the Leppings          Lane West Stand on N o tt i n g h a m Forest

tickets,      these had turned up without              tickets       but bought      from people

around the ground,            it was also       n oticeable    that many fans,            e specially

as numbers         grew,    smelled of alcohol.          I d i d n ’t see any d r u n k ^ a n s ,
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     R337

but many smelled             heavily of alcohol.

After    being     i nstructed to a llow the fan                 I   had e sc orted    to the

g ym nasium     into    the    stand area,        I returned to the same exit                 gate    *BV.

However,       despite       it only being        some    15 minutes       I had been away,           the

steward at the exit             gate    refused to a llow me back through                    showing me

the number       of people       outside.         At that time         I thought      it was quite

astounding       the numbers        that had a r r i v e d       in such a short        space of time.

Un de r st a nd i ng   the    reason for not being allo we d outside                  the     ground via

exit    gate    ’S ’ , I then went        to exit        gate    ’C* where    I m a na ge d to get

outside.

Once    outside a ga in        1' managed to get          to the      railings    by turnstiles         A-~G

but    felt quite       helpless as there was              no    possible way of        returning

to a turnstile,          there a pp ea re d to be so many fans to so few

Policemen.         It was       now that a superior             officer,   a lt ho u gh I ’m    not sure

who,    instructed me           to go to the wrought             iron perimeter       gates     facing

Leppings       Lane    to ensure       that the gate        closest      to the    river was         kept

shut.

I, along       with all       but two of my serial,              did not    possess a ny       personal

I noticed that          there were        two members       of the Police M o un t ed Sect io n

trying     to stop the          crushing that was         occurring.       However,     the     horses

were making        little       impact,    in fact       the    crowd was getting very angry

at the way they were             jumping about.

The    crowd at this          point were     getting       very heated as time was              getting

on towards       three       o ’clock and m ov ement        through the turnstil es a pp ea re d

to be very slow.              At this     point    I d o n ’t believe there were any

P ol i ce m en a c t u al l y working      the turnstiles.             Indeed,    with the amount

of    people    outside       it w ould have been v ir tually              impossible        to turn

anyone away who          had got through to a turnstile.

The    perimeter       gate    I was at was        shut a fter a struggle,             the    idea being
                                                                                                    PAGE         4
                                                                                                    R337

that    if all    the    perimeter       gates were    shut,    the    crush by the

turnstiles w ould be eased however,                  fans just outside these                 gates were

by now getting          very    irate,    shouting and       some hurling abuse              towards       us.

U nf ortunately,        it could be seen that there were a number                      of young

children    in this       crowd outside the gates and                I feared for        their       safety.

Immediately to my          right was a wrought          iron fence follo we d by a

further two gates which had been                shut    by the M o un te d Officers.                 The

crowd was gra du al ly          pushing    harder and on numerous o cc asio ns                 I was

having    d if fi cu lt y holding this        gate shut.        I was    by myself           on this

gate.     It was notic ea bl e that          large    numbers of people a lt ho ug h

possessing       tickets,       did NOT know where       that    part of the ground was

a n d many were     unable       to get out    of the    crowd to get to that                 part of

the ground after          being    instructed on where          they should        be.

At one    point    I a ll o we d my      perimeter    gate to be opened to allow a

father and his young             son and a pregnant woman to go through,                       the    crowd

at this    point    held back and a l lo we d them through before                   pushing again

when the gate was          shut.

The time must       now have       been getting       close    to three       o ’clock and          I felt

a surge.       I was     unable    to hold the gate          shut,    but made     sure that          I

was    pushed behind the fencing             to my right.        At this       point     I    was

fearful    for my own safety but there was a greater                      fear for

s u p p o r t e r s ’ safety as they crushed thro ug h the gate.                 S o me h ow    I

mana ge d to     shut    the    gate again,    but    increasingly more and more                    fans

were    climbing    over       fencing to my    left w hi ch     runs    parallel        to the

river,    in order       to get    round the    perimeter       gates.        I also w it n es s ed

numerous    people       climbing on the wall          between turnstiles                      and

turnstiles A-G,          gaining    entry by going       over this wall.

S oon after the         first    surge    there was a great          surge,    I was     thrown

behind fencing          to my    right as the    gate was forced open and                    I saw the

horses at the       centre       perimeter gates       get    pushed out of the way as
                                                                                                  PAGE       5
                                                                                                  R337

their    gates      too were forced open.

P eople were        falling       to the floor as the          rush of people          pushed them

over,    now      I was    ext re me ly aware       that    there were      going    to be some

serious      injuries       or deaths        if these      peole d i d n ’t get up off the ground.

On a couple         of occasions          I moved across my gateway are a to try and

hold the         crowd back to give these             people      chance to get up.

However,         the ones    on the ground d i d n ’t seem to realise                  the vast

numbers      pushing       indeed,       I w i tn es se d one man who       had fallen over,

lingering         to pick up his          loose   change w hi ch had s cattered on falling

from his         pocket.     It was at this          point    I realised another Policeman,

not from my serial,               was    present.     We urged       people    to calm down and to

stop    pushing,      but    it was useless,          the    crowd    continued to surge

towards     the t urnstile area.               I was am az ed       how quickly such a large

number     of     people    had    cleared from the area outside                the West Stand

turnstiles.          Onl y a few         people   remained,       looking     for shoes and other

items of         property they had lost             in the    surge.

As    I looked towards the ground,                  I saw that EXIT GATE             ’C ’ had been

opened.          I felt some       relief as      I was     in no doubt       that    if this    hadn't

opened many         people w ou ld have died outside.

As    I walked      round w ith other officers               outside    of t urnstiles A-G,            the

general      comments were of how quickly the area had cleared.                                It was

now 1' heard the           first    tannoy message          I had heard all a ft e rn o on and

that was         for the fans at the L ep pi ng s Lane               end to stop       pushing.

Bel i e v in g    it was a message          for those outside,          I thought       that    it was a

bit    late for that,         but       it was o b vi ou sl y meant     for those       inside as

after a few moments,               it was heard on personal             radios       possessed    by

some officers         that all          officers were       required    inside the ground.

I made my way         into the ground,            a ro un d the     rear of the West Stand onto

the South S ta nd and then on to the                    pitch.

I was met with the sight                  of a large       number    of P ol i ce m en stood up
                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                         R337

against      the fencing            of the West S tand           terrace o bv iously yelling and

urging      s upporters        to go backwards.              On the      pitch there were           numerous

people      ob v io us ly     injured.

Due to the numbers              of P o li ce me n at        the fencing        I stayed on the           pitch

wit h   injured        people many struggling                to breathe.         I comforted as many

as   I could but         it was       becoming a pp arant             that as more were          being

brought      onto     the     pitch the       injuries were           getting worse.            The medical

facilities at            the time a pp eared inadequate,                 but no o r ga n is a ti o n      could

envisage what            was happening.

].' remember         comforting       one supporter and on               looking       up,    seeing a dead

body    pulled onto           the    pitch after         that    it was one after another.

Liverpool        supporters who were                injured began to rip a d ve r ti se me nt

boards out to            use as m ak eshift           stretchers,        and   I then a s s i st e d to

transfer       the     dead    bodies       to the other        end of the       pitch.         Some   fans

still     preferred to shout abuse                    towards     us.

The N o t ti n gh a m Forest          fans were        still     chanting at the             liverpool    fans

causing some annoyance,                    making     it nec es sa ry for a Police              barrier       to

be placed across the                 pitch.     However,        whe n    I joined this          cordon,       the

m ovement      of injured and dead was well                     underway.

At 5.30      p.m.      I returned to the N or th S ta nd to wait                       further

instructions,           before       doing    so,     I collected names and ad dr es se s                of

some    people       stood on the Leppings Lane                   terrace and handed them to a

collecting Sergeant.                  At this time the game               had been        called off and

most    supporters          had gone from the ground.

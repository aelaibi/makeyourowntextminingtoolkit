  FOOTBALL
    IN THE
  COMMUNITY
It is Bristol Rovers' intention to promote closer links with the Local
Community in the building of their new stadium at Carson's
Road, Mangotsfield.

The Football Club has many ideas to put before the residents of
Kingswood and its surrounding areas, which they feel would be of
interest in this venture.

The Club would like to associate itself w ftfr Ktnjpwood Senior 'Citizms, :
by assisting with, or contributing to various projects.




SENIOR CITIZENS

Annual contributions and donations,
towards functions, including
Christmas Dinners, outings etc.

Organised shopping trips.




 A large area of accommodation will be allocated to such organisations as
 the Scouting and Guiding associations, pensioners and especially the
 Disabled bodies where they would administer and run their events at no
 costs to themselves as a Village Hall or Community Centre for the
 nearby areas.
 The Stadium would also include in this space such things as an Over
50's social club with free admission. Free membership during a period
from 12 pm to 3 pm some 2 or 3 days weekly, where they could enjoy
these facilities, and where also a luncheon at reasonable prices could be
served. This area could also be used for Bingo and Tea Dances, and a
Fitness and Dancing class could be held. A creche could possibly be
incorporated for those mothers who wish to use this facility.
This would be supervised.



           OVER 50'S SOCIAL CLUB


   TEA DANCES
BALLROOM DANCING
   WHIST DRIVES
      BINGO
A C om m unity gym nasium , medical and w eights room would be
available to those organisatons who wish to avail themselves of this
facility at times when not in use by the Football Club at nominal
charges.

                          CLUB ROOMS

                       Will indude areas for:-
                Girl Guides, Boy Scouts, Play Groups
                  Day Centres, Matchday Creche.

During school holidays the club would hold coaching sessions for young
boys and girls. We would wish to expand on these ideas when and
where possible and would like close links with the local bodies, e.g.
Councils, Police etc. and hope they would co-operate with us in this area
to bring enjoyment and a community spirit to all those who wish to
involve themselves in this project.

                 C oaching D isabled and the H andicapped
                 assisting them to form their own teams.
Other thoughts and ideas would be to create a closer tie with local
schools by visits by our playing staff and also visits to local hospitals
and other centres of this type. We would also encourage local school
parties to come to our League matches and our training sessions when
possible.

This programme should convince anyone doubting the integrity of this
club that we intend to involve those in the Local area who are interested
in involving themselves.

This project would be a fore-runner of future developments to come, in
that a Community provision is being made inside an ultra modern
stadium complex - the first of its kind in the country.

time      there      was     j ust      a .mass       of    people         outside          the       turnstiles.             No    queues

having       no     eff e c t .    I made       my w a y         towards           turnstiles             and     entered

through        turnstiles            marked         A to G.           O n my w a y        to     the      ground        I had       seen       a

few     people       drinking           and    carrying           canned           b e e r ? and         there     were       cans     of

beer      l y ing    about        that     people          had    drunk,           but    at     no      time     did    I see       any

violence.



I had      been      to    the     match       at     H i 11sborough               last     year         and    therefore           h ad

some     knowledge           of    the    ground.           I did        n ote      tha t      on a p p r o a c h i n g       the

they     did      last     year.        This    resulted              in the        mass       of     people       of    the

turnstiles           this       years.

Once      inside       the      ground        I had        some       i dea    of w h e r e         to    go    but     1 n o t e d that

there      were      no    signs        directing           peop l e      to       the    various          terrace          standing

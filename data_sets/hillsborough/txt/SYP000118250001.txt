                      been to perform d u t y at the Leppi n g s Lane                     t u r n s t i l e s , n o s . 1 to 8,

                      outs i d e    of the turns t i l e s at Leppi ngs L a n e , the time                  being

                      a p p r o x imately     11.45 a.m.

                       I was    stood outs i d e        the    penultimate tur n s t i l e      for the N o r t h S t a n d

                       <together w i t h WPC 3 0 2 7 T a g g ), before              the t u rnstiles        for    the West S t a n d


                      Between approximately                11.45 a.m.       and    1.45 p.m.      on that       date fans

                      e n t e r e d the t u r n s t i l e s at my l o c a t i o n in a slow m a n n e r .          I was

                      s u r p r i s e d at the     lack of persons who             had a r r i v e d by 1.43 p.m.            During

                      this     period       <11.45 a.m.        ~ 1.45 p.m.)        I s e a r c h e d several      persons
entering     the t u rnstiles and            removed several          u n o pened   pop cans and a

banner    -Prom persons.          Some    people        decided to open the           cans there and

then an d drink       them before entering an d                1 saw a number          of persons

s tood some d i s tance awa y from the turn s t i l e s drinking                      slowly.          I

could see by 1.45 p.m.               that a large number             of cans of beer a n d             pop

had been placed agai n s t a wall               nearby.

F r o m about   1,45 p.m.        onwards     the number        of    persons a r r i v i n g    began to

increase dramatically.               Searches       became more         infrequent as the              number

queuein g    up to enter         began to      increase.        At this stage          the m ood was

g e n e r a l l y good natu r e d but a lot of people had begun to                       congregate

about    13 yards a w a y from the turns t i l e s and were making                       no atte m p t           to

enter    the g r o u n d .    I saw a m o u n t e d Po l i c e Of f i cer on several

o c casions ask      those     c o n g r egating    to make     their way        into the stad i u m

but a large number            ignored these         requests and just m o v e d from one

position to a n o t h e r .       A few people we re a s k i n g me            if they could enter

without     tickets and         I informed them that            they     couldn't and m any

people were       queue ing up at my t u rnstile to then be told by myself

that    they had the wrong            ticket and had to go to anot h e r                 part of           the

ground.

After a w h i 1e I saw that            the    crowd w a i t i n g    to enter had begun to

increase     considerably.           At this       point a y o u t h was       refused entry by

one of the o f ficials           on the turnstile.              I a p p r o a c h e d this y o u t h       and

could smell       i n t o x icants    on his breath.            I informed him to           leave          the

area    due to his a p p a r e n t     drunkenness.           (I did not want          to arrest            the

yo u t h b ecause    I had to give           consideration          to the numbers a r r i v i n g at

the turnstiles).             He used some a b u s i v e       language and then j o i n e d a

queue at one of the other                turnstiles.         I a p p r o a c h e d him and seized

his arm,     informing        him that he was            under arrest       for a t t e m p t i n g    to

enter the ground whilst              drunk.        As    I did so he began using a b u s i v e

language and began to struggle.                     On    looking around for a s s i s t a n c e             I
                                                                                                       PAGE       3

could see         that    the    crowd had become             c o n s i derable and there was no

Pol i c e    back - u p a v a i l a b l e wit h i n a reasonable d i s t a n c e .        Several

persona s tood near              the y outh told me they were with him a n d w o u l d

take    him away.          Some       persons ar o u n d were         becoming   hostile and        in view

of this        I decided        in the       interests       of safety and to        prevent      injury to

a l l o w them to do so.               I saw them escort           the y outh a few yards away

before       losing      sight of them in the                crowd.

I m a n a g e d to squeeze my way back to the turnstile                          entrance      I had been

stood at a n d saw several                   youths    sitting on a c orrugated steel               wall

w h i c h d ivi d e d the seating             t urnstiles      from the turnstiles          for    those

wish i n g     to stand.         As    I looked a h e a d      I saw that the        crowd of      people

had become so            large that          I could no       longer    see past them.         T hey

stretched          in every direction.                I informed WPC Tagg          that    it w o u l d be

d a n gero us      to continue         s e arching     persons     due to the numbers arriving

and the dens i t y of the               crowd    in the       immediate     vicinity.       I saw that

m a n y of the youn g e r         persons       in front       of me were     chanting      loudly and

had cans of beer             in their         possession.        One    person had hold of a

bottle of beer an d was waving at me.                           He was e x t r e m e l y u n s t e d y on his

feet and a p p e a r e d very drunk.                  I s u d d e n l y felt a surge      of people

b e g i n to      push forwards and            I could see a m o u n t e d Police Of fi cer              in

the b a c k g r o u n d s i g n a l 1 ing w ith his arms          for    peopie to ho 1d back.                I

was    pushed m o m e n t a r i l y agai n s t        the wall     next to the turnstile.                I

shouted for          people not         to push,       yet    those    immedi a t e l y in front       of me

did not appear            to have       been pushing an d one man shouted,                  " I t ’s those

behind."          Persons       wit h tickets         for the wrong turnstiles            were     now

experiencing           difficulty        in leaving          the turnstile a rea an d        I was

having       to   p h y s i c a l l y hold    people    b a c kwards    in order     to make a small

gap for        these     persons       to squeeze       through.        Still more     people      seemed

to be pushing forwa r d s and the numbers                        sat on the steel wall            began to

increase.          Pe o p l e wer e     climbing       onto    ne a r b y fencing.     The m o u n t e d
                                                                                                    PAG E         4
                                                                                                    R 186

officers were          further       in the b a c k g r o u n d and there was a mass           of

people       between these          officers and o u r selves        on the turnstiles.              I

began to think at this stage                  that     some    people    could end up being

s e r i o u s l y injured and began to feel               concern for my own safety,                 I

a s k e d Pol i c e C o n s t a b l e T a g g , who was   looking       pale,    if she was okay

an d she said,         "Yes."

Suddenly       I felt a large          sus t a i n e d surge    towards    the t u rnstiles and               I

was   pushed f o r c i b l y against        the wall      next    to the turnstile          I was at.

I could not move           for a        second.        1 pushed back to gain some space                  and

saw that the          people    in     front     of me began to look s c a r e d .        An old         man

was   pushed f o r w a r d thro u g h the         crowd and      people near me were           pleading

w i t h me to        let him t h r o u g h . He    1ooked      badly shaken and         I had to push

amon g s t    the    crowd and make a          small    gap    to a llow him in t h r o u g h the

turnstile.          Several     men passed me          clutching     their      children,    m a n y of

w h o m were    crying and one          child had a bright           red colour        to his f a c e .

I assisted          these and a         couple of old m e n through the turnstiles.                       X

was   by now facing           the    crowd w i t h my back       against the w o o d e n frame of

the turnstile and             pressed     right    up against      it.     I was having        extreme

d i f f i c u l t y staying    in position an d by now I had               lost sight of WPC

Tagg and my other             colleague     on the turnstiles,            other than a WPC           on my

left who was          hav i ng extreme      diff i culty rnov ing and a p p e a r e d       very

upset.       1 raised my arm           in the air hoping          to a t t r a c t the a t t e n t i o n of

a m o u n t e d officer but they were not looking at me, there was a sea of

people,      some     in front       of me were      drunk and there was a lot of abusive

language       being used by some           in the      crowd.     I heard people         shouting,

" I t ’s going      to be another H e y s e 1" an d           "People are going         to get fucking

ki l l e d here."       I now feared for my life an d the                  lives of those           near

me as the surge          for the t u r n s t i l e s    reac h e d u nbearable      pressure.         One

man shouted          to me,    " T h e r e ’s an old man       on the floor here."           I could

not see for          the sheer       number of    persons      in front of       me.     I s h o u t e d to
the    persons     I was    facing         to stop         pushing and        lean back - there's a man

on the floor.           A w hite        teenage male y o u t h shouted at me                 "Fuck off,"

as the surge        continued.             There was a look of sheer                 panic    on the faces

of those d i r e c t l y     in front         of me.        I could now see some           people        pushing

forward hard an d          chanting.            I was       pushed sideways a g a i n s t the wall

next    to the     t u rnstile and by now was                  e x p e r iencing   difficulty

breathing.       I signalled            f r a n t i c a l l y towards   the m o u n t e d officers            but

they did not appear               to    respond.           I could feel my back           pressed against

the wall and         I was on my t i p - t o e s .            I began to feel         ext r e m e l y

f r i g h t e n e d and faint.          I could hear shouts              o f , " T h e r e 's going      to be

anot h e r H e y s e l " a n d    "Someone's          going    to die here."          I feared for my

life    by now.       1 saw the turnstile                   next to me and gras p e d the wo o d e n

frame w ith my h a n d s .             I forced a deep br e a t h a nd             pulled myself

towards      the turnstile.              People were          pushing from every           1s d e .      I

forced myself         into the turnstile and shouted at the official                                    taking

tickets     to   let me      through.           As    I    passed through the t u rnstile and

looked back        into    the crowd,           the       people at     the turnstiles were              pushed

right up a g a i n s t     them.         As   people        came t h r o u g h they were      by now

e x t r e m e l y a n g r y and frightened.               M a n y s h o u t e d towards me that          people

were    going    to die outside and vo i c e d their ann o y a n c e and anger                               that

they had been t h r o u g h such an ordeal                     at    the turnstiles.          I assisted

one    child who had been helped over the                           turnstile and        lost his

father.       I saw that some             of the other officers who had been w i t h me

earlier were        now on the           inside       of the t urnstiles w ith me.               T h e y also

said they had been               crushed agai n s t          the walls        outside.     I informed a

n earby    Inspector of the grav i t y of the s i t u a t i o n outside and the fact

that we had        lost    control.           He a c k n o w l e d g e d my    concern.

I then saw that           several        people were          jumping over a crash barrier

be h i n d the   t u rnstiles w h i c h s e p a r a t e d the N o r t h S t a n d supp o r t e r s             from

the West S t a n d s u p p o r t e r s - they were              jumping across           to the West
S t a n d side    of the barrier.                Some    then pushed the barrier            out of the

w a y and just        ran through.             The re were      people    running      past me     in all

directions.           I    was     now fearful       for my safety on this             side of the

barrier - several yo u t h s we re t h r e a t e n i n g a nearby Police Sergeant,

s w e arin g at him an d behaving                 in a very hostile manner and some began

shouting at me voicing                     their anger     over    the situation,          I saw several

people who         ran past me on the N o r t h S t a n d side               had tickets for           the

West Stand.           On       looking to my right           I saw several       people s tood on top

of the wall          next       to the      turnstiles.

Suddenly       I saw the gate at the side                    of me open and a sea of              people

run thr ough towards                the Leppi ngs Lane Stand.               In a few seconds           the

rush was       over and on the               instructions       of a Police S e r g e a n t      (whose

identity       I do not k n o w ) , I ran t h r o u g h this gate to the outside of

the stadium towards                  the    position     I had origi n a l l y o c c u p i e d at the

turnstiles.           I saw that            there we re very few peo pie now on L a p p i n g s

Lane.       As soon as            X reached the         turnstile area the same Police

Sergeant       shou t e d to me that there were                   people on the        pitch.     We both

ju m p e d over      one       of the t u r n s t i 1es and     round to the Police           control        box

in the ground.                 There were a large number              of Police O f f i c e r s    running

w i t h us n o w .        We    passed the Police           box and    ran onto the        pitch and as

we did so        I saw that           the L e p p i n g s Lane S t a n d a p p e a r e d to be

compl e t e ! y full           of L i v erpool    supporters.         I saw several        climbi ng from

the    lower tier          to the upper          tier.     There were      dozens of Police

Offi cers      in front of the fenc i ng betw e e n the Leppi ngs Lane S t a n d

a n d the    pitch and several Liv e r p o o l               fans were     on the      pitch.     My

first     i m p r e s s i o n was that        they were      i nvadi ng the pitch.          I ran

towards      the fence and as                I did so     I saw a middle aged man             being     passed

ov e r h e a d by the          crowd and the Pol i c e O f f i c e r s a s s i s t i n g   some to      c 1 imb

over the fencing.                  At this     point     I r e a l i s e d s o mething was w r o n g tho u g h

fence near to the goal area                      I saw several Police O f f i c e r s                inside       the

te r r a c i n g among      the      crowd - they a p p e a r e d to be jostling w i t h some                         fans

and a lot of abuse was                  being d i r e c t e d towards           them,       I saw some           persons

attempting           to grab the officers an d being                      held back by other fans and                       I

saw some fans            climbing up           from the        lower terrace          to the higher          terrace.

1 then       looked to m y            right and saw a large               number of        people     lying      in

d i f ferent        positions        on the floor           near   to the barrier.             There were young

an d old alike and              I     saw a pair of legs sti eking up w i t h the                         rear of the

body buried b e n e a t h             other bodies.            It was at this           point I realised the

g r a v i t y of the situation.                 The    next     thing     I remember         1 was    stood       near

to one of the gates                  in the barrier           giving access         to the       pitch.       This

gate was open.              A small        child,      white male,         about     10 years        old,    wearing

a red      'T ' shirt an d jeans was                  being     passed     through the g a t e s .           I

grab b e d hoid of the               child and        carried him onto           the       pitch where       I saw

some St.        J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e   people a t t e n d i n g    to some         injured    people.           I

placed the           child on the floor and saw that he was                            limp,     he was      not

br eathing and he was white w ith                       purple       colouring a r o u n d his            lips and

eyes.       I could not             feel a pulse and began to give heart m a s s a g e while

two    nearby St.         john's A m b u l a n c e m e m b e r s a p p r o a c h e d and       began       to give

artif i c i a l      respir a t i o n and assist             w i t h the m a s s a g e .    E v e n t u a l l y he

b egan to breath a g a i n and a pulse                       r e t u r n e d , though he      remained

unconscious.             I left this y o u t h w ith the S t . John's A m b u l a n c e                     people

and    returned to the above m e n t i o n e d g a t e .                   <I do not know the               identity

of the y o u t h but see a p p e n d i x              ’A*    at end of order).

As    I returned        I saw several            Police O f f i c e r s ’ helmets           be i ng th r o w n in

a n a g g r e s s i v e manne r f rom Leppi ngs Lane                  lower terraces           over       the fence

towa rds officers             near the pitch.                The re was a lot of chant i ng and

abuse     being d i r e c t e d       towards      the P o l i c e    by a large number              of

s upp o r t e r s   in Leppi ngs L a n e .            I saw that        people we re crushing               forw a r d

to get out of the gate                  but that        the back        of the     lower     terrace was

                                                           -                                               R 186

a lmost      empty.         I s h o u t e d for   people to move         back       into the       space and

some      d i d , but m a n y kept         pushing    forward.         After several          people       had

been      carried out of the gate                 I went       in towards a barrier               down the

mi d d l e   of the        terrace,     be 1 ieving there were           still          dead and    injured on

that      side.       As    I e n t e r e d several    people became abusive and some were

hysterical.            I a p p r o a c h e d the barrier a n d saw there a p p e a r e d               to be no

 injured on my side              but    I still      saw m any bodies             lying on the floor on

the other           side    of the     barrier.       Some     fans    shouted h y s t e r i c a l l y at me

and     I was       fearful     for my safety.           Po l i c e Officers and several                  fans

were      carrying them out and trying                   to assist       some.           I saw the re was a

very a g g r e s s i v e a t t i t u d e    by fans on that           side    of the barrier           towards
                                                                              \
of f icers a n d a b u s i v e       language was        being d i r ected towards                them.     I

climbed out           of the gate          I had ente r e d and went              round to a n o t h e r gate

on the other           side     of the d i v iding       barrier.        There were m a n y Police

Officers           there and as        people were       passed out of the gate we all                      took

turns at           carrying     them on to the         pitch.         It was       obvious    that man y of

those we did           carry were a l r e a d y dead.             I saw an amb u l a n c e         next to

this     gate an d several             a m b u l a n c e m e n assisting.         All    the time Police

helmets were           being     thrown towards us             from the terrace and                I saw one

hit a P olice Officer.                  I hand l e d man y bodies,            some alive a n d some

dead and a s s i s t e d        in taking them onto the                pitch.           I do not know their

identities.

I heard the Notts Forest                   fans    chanting though            I could not hear what

they were          saying and this a d d e d to the hysteria of the Liverpool

fans.        M a n y fans were         pulling    up boarding         to use as s t retchers and

as s i s t i n g   to take dead and           injured towards the Pe n i s t o n e R o a d side of

the    pitch.        I a s s i s t e d w i t h this.       One y o u t h who was drunk              grab b e d

hold of me on the              pitch as       I was    doing     this,       his face was          covered       in

blood.        He kept       telling me he w a n t e d to see K e n n y D a l g l i s h a n d              he

w o u l d not      let go of my         clothing.       It took several                 minutes    for me to
shake him off an d              continue assisting.               I began     comforting           some of the

injured and fam i l y and friends                     of the dead on the pitch.                    I was    then

ordered to join a line of Po l i c e O f f i c e r s                     stood across        the    centre of

the    pi t ch and       prevent Liv e r p o o l       f a n s , other     than injured,           passing.        I

saw a large         number       of Poli ce Dog H a n d l e r s and dogs appear                    on the    pitch

behind me.          The a t m o s p h e r e   in the gr o u n d was still           very tense an d I

was    fearful      for my safety.             M a n y Liv e r p o o l    fans were    incensed at the

N otts Forest           fans    though a broadcast             by K e n n y D a l g l i s h asking     people

to co-operate            over    the ground tannoy system he 1 ped ease                       the

situation.          Liverpool        fans began to            calm down though several

a p p r o a c h e d Police O f f i c e r s    in a th r e a t e n i n g manner and some of these

were    obv iously hyster i cal and man y we re shouting a buse at us.                                     Some

fans were,         however,       ext r e m e l y    c o - o p erative and a s s i s t e d    in the

removal        of bodies and supporting                  upset    fans.

After a while            I was ordered,             together wit h other officers                  in the

1 i n e , to    leave      the ground via the P e n i s t o n e Road exit whi ch I did.                            I

then p e r formed duty            in Peni stone Road,             directing Notts Forest

suppo r t e r s    to    coaches and vehicles,               ensuring e m e r g e n c y vehicles            had

u n o b s t r u c t e d exits available             from the ground.

After    d e - b r i e f i n g at the ground,            I returned to E c c l e s f i e l d Police

S t a t i o n at 7 p.m.         and went      off duty from that             location.

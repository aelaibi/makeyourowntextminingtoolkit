              OVWnI t

Lord Justice Taylor was most grateful to you for giving him your
time yesterday, especially at such a busy time for you, to
explain some of the arrangements at Wimbledon for crowd control
and safety.   He found his visit most helpful, and would be
grateful if you would pass on his thanks to Major Tetlow for
conducting round the ground.

As you will have realised, Lord Justice Taylor is particularly
interested in the arrangements made to accommodate standing
spectators. During the course of his visit he discussed with
Major Tetlow how large the standing area available is, on both
sides of the centre court. He wondered if it would be possible
for him to have a note of the detailed area involved, if this
could be measured in square metres at a convenient moment after
the Championships. If you were able to let him have a simple
plan of the terraced area, with an indication of the lay out of
crush barriers, that would be even more helpful. Similar
information for court No. 1 would be helpful.

I hope very much that you will be able to assist Lord Justice
Taylor in this way. If you are not entirely clear as to what is
wanted, please get in touch with me and I will be happy to
elaborate further.

                                       Yours sincerely

               On         turday,       15th      April          1989,       in    company          with       m ^ ^ T io th e r     and    friend,

                                           I went,          to    the       semi-final             between          Liverpool          and

               Nottingham          Forrest.             We       had    tickets          for       the       North       Stand.        We

               arrived       at    the    ground            at    about       2.15       pm.        It       was    at    the      Leppirsg

               Lane       entrance.           When      we       arrived          at    the       ground       there       was       already       a

               large       crowd    queuing            to    get       in.        We    had       attended          the    semi — final           at

               Hillsborough             the       previous            year,       when       we    were       in    the    Lepping          Lane       end.

               This       year    because         we    had       tickets          for       the    North          Stand,       we    looked       at

               our       tickets    to    see      which          turnstile             we    had       to    use.        We    found       that

               it    was    one    on    the       left      of       the    Leppings             Lane       end,    near       to    the    end       of

               the       ground    (as    you       look         at    the    ground)             and    immediately               around     the

               corner       from    the       shops.             Whilst       we       were       checking          our    tickets,          I saw

               a    little       window       open      in a          concertina             gate,       which       leads         into     the    ground
                                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                                    S3481

open.        I then             saw       a    s u p p o r t e r , who              I had          seen       knocking             on

the    gate       pass          what          1 took        to    be       a    five             pound       note,       to    a

Policeman             on    the       other          side        of    the          gate.              The    gate       was       opened

slightly          and       the       supporter                beckoned              to          three       others       and       they

were    allowed             through                the    gate        into          the          ground.           The    gats          was

then    closed.                 Two       or       three       lads        who       were          near       us    must       have          seen

what    1 had          seen          because             I heard           one       of          them     shout,         “T h e y ’ re

letting          them       in       for       money",           and       then          a       group       of    supporters                no

mors    than          thirty,             rushed          towards              the       gate.           They       were       banging

on    the    gate,          but       it       w a s n ’t      opened           again.

We    then       queued          to       get       in    through              the       turnstile                with    our       tickets.

It    took       us    about          five          minutes           to       get       in.           I d i d n ’t      see       that

gate    opened             again.              When       I arrived                 inside             the    ground,          I did          not

look    at       the       inside             of    the     gate       so       I    could             not    say       how    many

Policemen             were       at       the       gate,        or    it       any          Stewards             were    there.              We

went    into          the       North          Stand        and       found          our          seats       without          any          problem.

The    match          kicked          off,          and     after          a    few          minutes,             there       was       a    big

surge       of    supporters                   coming          into        the       North             Stand.           There       was       so

many,       some       were          just          sat    on     the       steps             between          the       seats.

Since       the       disaster,                I have          thought              about          the       incident,             and       having

been    questioned                   by       officers           from          Greater             Manchester             can       only

describe          the       Policeman                at     the       gate          as       being       a    Constable,

because          I saw          he    was          wearing        a    helmet                1    cannot          say    how       old       he    was

or    anything             else       about          him,        except             that          he    was       clean       shaven.

I would          not       be    able          to    identify              him       again.

L &
                football             ground.           I left        the      ground          at    around          10.30am     (1030)       and       my

                random          checks          took     place.




                At       around       3pm       (1500)          later     the      same       date    in    company        with       my    serial          I

attended          at    C l a y w h e e 1s Rd              Traffic          g a r a g e , where           I was       to    take       my    meal.




I had       just       sat     down         after           collecting              my    meal       when       I heard          on a       nearby

personal          radio        another            officer             was    wearing           that       there       was       trouble          at

the    football          ground,             at       the       Leppings          Ln     stand.           I returned             to    the

transit       van       we     had      been          allocated             and     we    left       C l a y w h e e 1 s to       attend          at

the    ground.




Minutes       later          in    company             with       other        officers          in       the    van       I attended             at

the    rear       of    the       Leppings             Ln       stand.        The        van    parked          on    the       road.        I saw

that    other          officers             were        present         at     this       location.              I saw          that       there

was    no    fighting             taking          place.              Mounted          squad     officers             were       present          and

appeared          to    be     holding            a    small          crowd       of     football          supporters             back       from

entering          the    ground.              I saw             that    a    number        of    the       supporters             were       drunk.




Having       left       t he      van       I was          requested           to      assist        other       officers             to    form       a

cordon       across          the       main       entrance             to    the       Leppings           Ln    stand.           After       a    few

minutes       I was          requested                by    a    Police        Inspector             to    attend          inside          the

main    gate.           I saw          at    this          point       that       there        was    a    number          of    football

supporters             laid       on    the       floor          being       attended           to    by       the    St.       Johns

Ambulance.              I saw          that       one       man       had    gone        blue    and       was       being       given       the

Kiss    of    Life.          I then          saw       other          supporters           walking             about       holding          their

chests       and       obviously             in       pa i n .




Fire    and       Ambulance             services                arrived       at       this     time.           I assisted             with

other       Police       Officers             to       hold       a    crowd        of    supporters             back       to    allow          the

services          to    gain       access             to    the       rear     gate.




I saw       two    men       laid       on    the          floor       on    their        backs           near       to    the    tunnel

entrance          to    the       Leppings             Ln       stand.       I could           see     that      they       were
                                                                                                                                                PAGE           3
                                                                                                                                                S3325

             obviously           dead     their          eyes       were       open       there       was    no    movement           and      the

             older      looking         man        of    the       two       had    had       his   false        teeth       placed       on    his

             chest.         The       younger           was    laid          with       his   arms     out       his    clothes          had    almost

             been     pulled          from        his    body.           At    the       request       of    a    Police        Inspector            in

             company        with       other        persons             supporters            and     police       off i cers         I ass isted

             by    moving        the    two        bodies          to    a    place       nearby       where       I saw        that      t h e re    w e re

             several        other       bodies           laid       on       the    floor.          I then        assisted          by    helping         to

             put     injured          persons           into       ambulances.                 I then       assisted           with      crowd

             control        as    football              supporters             were       leaving         the     Leppings          lane       gate.       I

             saw    that     the       supporters              were          very       abusive       towards          all     Police

             Officers        stood        around.              A    shortwhile                later    when       the    main       crowd       had

             left     the    ground           I    retuned          to       the    transit         van     and    the       area     was

             patrolled           re    any        public       order          situations.




             At    a round       6 . 10pm         the    same       date       I returned             to C l a y w h e e l s     whe re I took

             my    meal     and       then        left    Sheffield                to    return       to D o n c a s t e r ,     where I went

             off     duty    at       8 pm.       (2000)

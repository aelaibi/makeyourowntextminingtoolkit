                 Since    1962      (000062)     I have also         been a member          of the S Yorkshire

                 Special      Constabulary.          I presently hold the                 rank    of    'Sub Divisional

                 O f f i c e r ’ I work   in close      l»|on       with        VB2'   d i v ision based       in Wombwell

                 Sheffield,         however    our duties          include      the P e n istone       area.



                 Th r o u g h o u t my service      I have     covered most            semi — finals        held   in

                 Sh e f f i e l d my duties      have also         been of a similar             nature    in c o nnection

                 wi t h the       football,    I regulate traffic                flow through the P e nistone

                 area    in the d i r ection of Sheffield.                      In 1988    I was       on duty for      the
 semi         final        between Liverpool              and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.



 On S a t u r d a y       15th April,,        1989     (150489)        1 reported for          duty at P e nistone

 PST N about 9.30 am                 (0930 hrs)          I reported         to Inspector Ashby who              I work

 in close           liaison with,           if he requires any Special                    C onstables      to work-

 in c onjunction with his                    regular Officers               he usually      contacts me at

 horns   ,


 On this       day        I was    to supervise           the       following Special          Constables,




             NJ I 2 T 7 7 3
 SC                                was a s s i g n e d to duties            not    connected with        the

 s ch e d u l e d    semi - final          at Hillsborough,                he w o r k e d with a regular

 officer        covering          the D o d w o r t h area.



 Inspector Ashby               briefed us at P e nistone P STN of our                       duties     for the

 day.        I was        to supervise SC                       a n d _____________ at      the    junction

 (A 6 E S ) Manchester             to B a r n s l e y Rd and          (A616)      Huddersfield      to S h e f f i e l d

f Rd.     This       junction        is a p p r o x i m a t e l y    five miles       from Penistone.           This

 junction           caters     for heavy traffic                flow t r avelling         towards S h e ff i e l d      on

 major       football         matches.         Myself and SC                            were    in p o s s e s s i o n of

 radios.            The    intention was           to cover         this    particular      junction until             the

 incoming           volume     of traffic          had    passed trough the junction,                  this

 w o u l d be about S . 30 pm               (1430 hrs),             by this    time    it is usually        for most

 t ravelling          supporters          to have alre a d y           passed through the junction.



 At about           10.15 am       (1015 hrs)         myself and           the two said Special

 Constables           arrived at our             desi g n a t e d     post.       1 had wo r k e d at this

 junct i o n        on numerous         previous         occasions         regulating      football

 traffic.            Betw e e n    1015 and        1300 hrs          traffic      flow a p p e a r e d normal     in
                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                       5943

c o mparison to         previous     years.       From about           1300 hrs the volume          of

t raf f i c: i rtcreased at thi s junction?                  at this     time   1 recollected

three     to four       coaches    passing thro u g h the junct i o n and whose

occ u p a n t s were drinking           from    cans a l t h o u g h    I hadn't     been   instructed

w ith    relation to s t op/check alcohol                    offences     I was aware       that

on previous           occasions    the S Y o r kshire O f f icers            had    certain    locations

near S h e f f i e l d where      the    coaches were          stopped and m o n i t e r e d with

relation to alcohol              offences.         1 was      concerned      primarily w i t h keeping

the traffic           flowing through this major                j u n c t i o n at all   times.



From about 2.20           prn (1420 hrs)         onwards       the volume       of traffic       had

de c r e a s e d as    I would of expected.              I had       not e x p e r ienced any

difficulties           in superv i s i n g my officers at               the junction.         However     at

this     time a white       transit       type minibus          stopped m o m e n t a r i l y at the

junction,       it came     off the A616 from the d i r e c t i o n of Huddersfield,                           it

had betw e e n        11 •- 15 occupants,         o b v iously       football      supporters,      I saw

several      supporters       in this      vehicle       drinking        from   pint glasses.



I had seen this           occur    on several          previous        occasions     on previous

football       matches     so w a s n ’t surprised.



M y s e l f and SC I              and                    then    returned to Pe n i s t o n e PST N fo

a refreshment           break.     I had       cause    to    call     in at home and       1 had seen

the     incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h    stadium on the            telev i s i o n at about 3.30

pm    (1530 hrs)        1 returned to Pen i s t o n e PSTN,              regular     officers      from

the PSTN had been d i r ected to the disaster                           myself and my a s s i g n e d

Especial C onstables          then      covered the Pen i s t o n e a rea for any

assistance        calls    in the area.            I. was     involved      in two    road a c c i d e n t s    i

the Pen i s t o n e area that afternoon.

                        due      to       someone           going          through        the           gate          I moved                 across           towards               the      gat*

                        and      1 was          stumbling               over       someone              lying          on         the         floor,,              I put           my      arms

                        out      and       then           suddenly           I was       out        of      the        gate              and     on       to       the         pitch.

                        I staggered                  onto        the       pitch        and    when            I found                   space        I     collapsed                   on    to

                        the      floor          gasping              for     breath.

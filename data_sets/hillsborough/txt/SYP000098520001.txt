Dear Sir,

Hillsborough

Thank you for letting us have the report into the further
investigations carried out pursuant to our letter of 19th July
addressed to the D.C.C.

We find that we have been remiss also in not formally acknowledging
receipt of your earlier letter of 9th July, 1990 and accompanying
report and may we take this opportunity of thanking you for dealing
with these matters.

Subject to any strong views of Gounsel, we do not propose to concede
the responsibility for monitoring numbers in the individual pens of
the Leppings Lane terraces but, realisti cally, we must face the
likelihood of this issue going against us, as it did at the inquiry.

If that is so then, again realistically, our prospects of
substantially improving on the outcome of the inquiry rest on
convincing the Court that the collapse of barrier 124A occurred as
a result of culpable failure on the part of the Club's Consulting
Engineers.

For the time being, the only further matter upon which we would
appreciate your assistance is preparation of a compilation video,
the basic format of which has been discussed between the writer and
Superintendent Bettison.
                                                         \

                                  FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

      Following Questions yesterday it was put to the Prime
 Minister that the Government needed to have an answer if it
 were asked what it would do should, unexpectedly, Lord
 Justice Taylor take a different view on membership cards
 from Mr. Justice Popplewell.  It was argued that the
 Government needed to be able to demonstrate that proceeding
 with the Bill did not put the Government past the point of
 no return on the membership scheme.

      The answer might be that the Government would certainly
 have to give Lord Justice Taylor's views serious
 consideration; indeed there would be a presumption that it
 would not proceed in the face of such advice.  If it decided
 not to proceed the Government could decide not to lay the
 Order approving the scheme.

       The difficulty would be that the Bill requires the
 Foo.tball Membership Authority to draw up a scheme and it
 could be left in the position of still being required to do
 this even though the Government had stated that it was not
 proceeding.   Would it be possible to add to the Bill the
 provision that the Football Membership Authority would
 prepare a scheme "if so directed by the Secretary of State"?

      All this may be hypothetical (more likely than a firm
 recommendation against membership cards would be a set of
 conditions that had to be satisfied) but it nonetheless
 seems worth preparing an answer to such a question.

          I would be grateful for advice on this point.

      I am copying this letter to Roger Bright (Department of
 the Environment), Colin Walters (Home Office), Steven
 Catling (Lord President's Office), Nick Gibbons (Lord Privy
 Seal's Office) and Murdo Maclean (Chief Whip's Office).

                Further to my statement I made to the West Midlands Police                     regarding

                the      incident at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 15th

/ V L T J       A p r“     1989    (150489> ”   1   have the following to state
                ^ft.er administerinq            resuscitation to the deceased Rogers on the

                Leppinqs      lane Terrace          I carried the body onto the pitch near to the

                goal mouth.          I then left the body for a short time,             to assist with

                other     casualties.

                On returning to Rogers               I cannot    recall anyone being with him.       The

                deceased was then taken to the gymnasium where he was certified life

                extinct and laid out.

             At/ 8    am (0800)        on Saturday,          15 April        1989,      (150489),             I commenced duty

             at West Bar Police Station and took charge of serial                                             8   .    Our duties

             for the initial phase was to supervise both the Nott ino-nam F orest fans
                                            ---------------------     X  --------
             and the Liverpool fans as they arrived at the Hidljiffld Station by

             train.        They were then to be escorted to the Hillsborough Football

             g round.



             After a briefing at West Bar Police Station at 9 am (0900), my serial

             took up position at the Midland Station at 9.30 am (0930).                                                    This duty

             continued until shortly ig^te^ 2 pm (14QQ) when my serial                                                 travelled to

             the ground and took position in the gymnasium at Hillsborough awaiting

             further       instructions.

                                                                                                      S962C

                               Whilst at the gym it became apparent from the radio traffic that there

                               was an increasing problem developing at the turnstliifs at the Leppinqs

                               Lane end of the ground.      In view of this,   1 ns^Ctor   SEWi£LL directed

                               myself and 9 Police Constables*     who were close at hand,     to make cur

                               way to the Leppings Lane end in an attempt to alleviate the problem.



                               On route to the Leppings Lane end I saw a problem developing at a set
                f£<v
      i/? / £^ ^ o f                 large blue coloured concertina doors.     I saw persons   climbing over
                 . ^ nM*



                                he doors in an effort to gain entry.      I could see through the

                               turnstiles that persons were on the floor outside the ground and due

• 5    S         &             to the crowd they were unable to get to their feet.          Persons were

                 *             screaming at us through the turnstiles to open the doors or people

                               would be crushed.

           /J                  The large door was visiblv moving under the pressure being exerted oi
      fa   & &r      /
                         4--     "    Screams   could be heard coming from the other side of the gate.

                               After what appeared like several minutes the door was opened and a

  ji/jiuLP*'                   large flood of people entered shouting and complaining at the crush.

                               Numerous were gasping for breath some close to unconsciousness the

                               majority visibly shocked.



                               After the initial flood had died down I took my officers to the front

                               of the Leppings L a ne terrace via the south side of the ground.        As we

                               made our way onto the pitch,     1 could see that the Leppings Lane

                               terrace in front of the goal was full to over capacity.          As I looked

                               at the front of the terrace     I saw that persons were being     crushed

                               against the perimeter fence unable to move.        The bodies appeared to toe

                               six or seven deep.      The exit gate was open however,     due to the volume

                               of people nobody could get out.      There was only a couple of Police

                               officers there at this time.      It was obvious that a large number of
                                                                                                                      PAGE    3

                    people at the front were already unconscious or d e a d .                             Screams of pain

                    could be heard coming from the trapped.                          Victims    ranged from small

                    children to women and old people.                         The crowd at the rear of the

                    terrace however appeared unaware of the carnage at the front and were

                    aggravating the situation by continuing to push.                            The tunnel

                    connecting the terrace with the o u ter part of the ground was full with

                    persons still entering.                   On seeing this,        I directed the officers to

                    attempt to get as many persons as possible out of the terrace and onto

                    the pitch.           Numerous attempts by myself to get the crowd to move away

                    from the front was met by a hail of abuse and several missiles were

                    thrown at us.             It was obvious           that a large number of the rowdy crowd

                    had been drinking and were drunk.                          I then tried to get as many out of

                    the terrace as possible.



                    After a while            1 C 1 i Hibed over      the fencing j f o   gain entry into the

                    terrace in o rder to administer first a i/G                      to peopl



                    I approached a young male youth at the front of the terrace who had

                    been trapped under the crowd.                       The young ma*n showed no signs of l ife ,

                    I therefore          commenced m o u t h to m o u t h        resuscitation.        After s e v e r a l

                    minutes,         no r e s p o n s e was a p p a r e n t   I therefore   carried     the   body    onto

           Further to my previous statements made to the West Midlands Police

           dated S May 1989 <080589),             3 June     1989 (030689) and 5 July 1989

           (050789).

           As stated on page t^               my statement dated             8   May 1989 (080589),      I
           t
           carried the body of Henry CK^sJes ROGERS                        (24) from pen three and laid

           him out in the penalty area at the                              gs Lane end of   Che a r o u n d ,

           left the body at that end of the ground and then furtner assisted in

           carrying cieSKl bodies on hoardings from the Leppings Lane end.

           Some time l a t e r c a n n o t > ^ m e m b e r when,           I again came into contact

           with the body of Henry Char Ies'^ROGERS.                    I cannot remembe r e x a c 1 1y

           where the body was when I saw it ag-sHsjn, bilt^ I'm fairly sure that the

           body was in the area of the ground in between the North stand and the

           Spion K o p .   As best I remember,            it was from that area of the ground
         who    I cannot identify.

         On page two of my stinternent dated      8   Hay 1989 (080589)? it states that

         the body of Henry Charles KQ        GE

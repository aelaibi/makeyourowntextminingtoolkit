               I am employed by Rentokil,                                and   I live at the above

               address.

               When    I learned that the F.A.Cup Semi               final   between Liverpoo 1 and

               Nottingham Forest was to be played at Hillsborough Football Stadium

               Sheffield,        I made arrangements with my friend                              to go

               and watch the match.

               I tried through proper channels in the weeks                    prior to the match to

               obtain tickets for myself and my friend but without success.

               I knew from last years equivalent Semi                  final   that there were ticket

               touts outside the ground and it was with these in mind that we decided

               to go to the match and purchase them from these touts.

           At about 7 pm on Friday 14th April                    1989 together with

               I went to Sheffield and stayed with a friend who lived quite close to
                                                                                             PAGE     2

                the ground,        our intention being to get to the ground early to obtain

                the tickets.

                At about       12Xjjm Midday 15/4/89 we arrived at Hillsborough itself and

                began to look fbr ticket touts.            We went to the Leppings Lane area

                first and within ten minutes we had found a tout.

                I can only describe him as a white male           in his 20's black hair,     clean
                                         \
c   a   t       shaven wearing a g\een jacket.            He also had a Liverpool accent.      I

                paid £25.00 for one ticket for the Spion Kop           (Nottingham Forest)     end

                of the ground.            I knew,we did not have a lot of money between us so we

                decided to go to the Spiflm Kop end to look for other,            perhaps cheaper,

                t ic k e \ t o u t s .   We got to the Spion Kop end and within 15

                minutes we had located another tout.            I can describe him as being well

                dressed in a brown leather jacket and dark trousers.              He was a

                whi^fi male,        of a tanned appearance,   clean shaven with thinning dark

                <iair.     v paid £20 for that ticket which was also for the Spion Kop end,

                with that intention in mind,

                I remember        reaching the turnstiles and          asked a Policeman in that

                vicinity whether we could use our tickets at that end,            he said that we

                could use the tickets toxgain entry at that end.            He took the tickets

                and tore off the stufabs ana\allo we d us t h r o u g h , that would be at about

                1 pm.

                Through the turnstile there was a line of about a dozen Police

                officers who were searching everyone coming through.

                I passed thr^mi^h the line of o f f i cers and I bought a programme from a

                seller and walked with                 towards the tunnel where   I could see the

                pitch,     to be honest,       I didnt know there was any other entrance,

             At the entrance to the tunnel there were no Stewards or Police

             grid    (PRS1)    of the questionnaire and we sat down on the terraces which

             I   now produce exhibit                  no.

             At this point there we re not many people                                              in pen 4 or 3 in fact you had

             more or less a clear view along the Leppings Lane terrace.                                                 It

             continued to be very quiet and at about                                              1.30 pm I decided to get some

             coffee.         I walked back up the tunnel and then right where there was a

             refreshment bar near another entrance to the terracing,                                               in fact before

             this time I didnt know there was another access to the terraces.

             After    purchasing the coffee I walked back and took up my previous

             position.

             It was just before 2 pm that due to the volume of spectators

             arriving we actually had to stand up.                                               It struck me as a little odd

             that the Nottingham Forest                     <Spion Kop)                          end was quite full and our end

     '       was fairly empty for the time.

             From^SV-m the re was an i nc rease in the number of spectators                                             coming in

             got out of the pens obfi to the numbers of people there.

             My feelings at this                point was that the pens had reached capacity but

             it was not overfull                by any standards.

             The next ten minutes or so found a great deal more                                               people entering

             this    pert.    At about 2.40 pm the situation was so bad that                                          I had lost

                      behind me and I had been pushed to position                                            (X 2 ) indicated on

             the questionnaire grid.

             It was also at about this time when people around me began to moan

             about being pushed and moved about.                                       I heard many rnoans and complaints

             and screams that they were being crushed.

When the players       came outv about\2,50 the pressure       increased^

considerably and I was physically lifted off my feet on a couple of

occasions.        At this time there didn't seem to be any control,         it

seemed like a sea of people swaying and being             crushed up against each

other.    There were a number of people continually moaning about being

c rushed .

I saw the kick off but nothing else of the match.               A few minutes after

I saw a person to my right beckoning to stewards and Police.                I never

heard what they said but          I could see they were trying to get their

attention and I thoug'hi someone had fainted.      Also at about this time
  e^YT   ^ a t v /c ?         ^ I H            *£
I saw people climbing o v e r t h e fence from Pen 3 onto the pitch and I

believe they were       put back into the same    pen but a bit further along.

After that there seemed to be an escalation of things and everyone

seemed to be moaning.           I could see more and more people were trying to

climb the perimeter fence to get onto the pitch.

From my position I saw a Policeman run onto the pitch and the referee

stopped the match.        I realised then that there was a serious over

crowding problem.        I thought that those climbing the fence would be

put    into another    pen.     I also saw people being    pulled into the seating

area above me.

I noticed then a big broad man who had been lifted above the heads of

the spectators.        He was    right up against the perimeter fence and

people were trying to lift him over without success.

The man looked dead and lifeless and it was then when I realised the

full seriousness of the s i t u a t i o n . \ I n the ten minutes that followed I

1 was still       in my position but the pressure began to decrease.             I saw

people who had been in the          centre of the pen come towards my fence who

had suffered crushing          injuries and had the   'wind'   knocked out of

them.    After that an increasing        number of people had got onto the

pitch and 1 saw the ambulance arrive.

When I thought m o H ^ o f     the injured had got over the fence INJecided to

climb the fence dividing         pen 4 and 5 and I got onto the pi t c h \ h r o u g h

pen 5 g a t e .                           ^

On the pitch I saw a lot of Policemen,           ambulancemen and a few firemen
                        ’
                        "'N,
and a lot of supporters.

I also saw about 3 people who were dead lying by the goalposts.                  I

thought to myself that         I was going to get    in the way so I decided very

quickly to get off the pitch.             climbed back into Leppings Lane

terracesxat Pen 6.

I stayed in the ground for 10 minutes and I then saw people being

carried away on hoardings and advertising boards.               I was   in a state of

shock and feeling numb and useless and I left the ground and returned

to my car.

Inside the ground 1 saw a press photographer threatened and I saw a

few punches and kicks aimed at him.            Outside the ground I saw a very

great number of Police officers being threatened by fans although I

never saw any actually assaulted.

My own opinions are that no more persons should have been allowed into

that section of\the ground because there was nowhere for them to fan

out.    Stewards and Police should have directed them to the corner

ter rac es.

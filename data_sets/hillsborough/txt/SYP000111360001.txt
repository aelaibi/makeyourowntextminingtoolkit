               responsible              to P o l i c e    Sergeant         1561       Reynolds.               Briefed           at

              Hillsborough               ground       and     commenced             duty     on    road       junctions              on L e p p i n g s

              Lane,        approximately              S50 yards           from       the     ground,          preventing              passing

               supporters             going        down   these      roads.           Odd     ones       managed           to    get      down

               them,       obviously            for   ’t o i l e t ’ p u r p o s e s .        This       duty        commenced           at

              approximately                 11 a.m.       that morning.                   Myself,        Police           Sergeant         Reynolds

              and        seven       other      officers.           At    t his      tim e    and    for        the       remainder            of    the

               day Police             Sergeant        ReynoIds           was    the       only     one       with a personal                   radio.

              F rom a b o u t         mi d d a y    onwards     the re w a s          a steady           flow        of    supporters

               passing          the     ro ad      junctions        where       I was        on    duty w i t h           other       officers.

               It was          evident       e v e n at     this     early          stage     that       a    large        number         of

               supporters             had    been     drinking.            Also       a    fair     number           were       either

               carrying          plastic           carriers     with       beer       and     l ager         in,     or    drinking            from

               cans,       or    plastic           bottles.         At    one       point     t h er e       were     more       people

               passing          us    drinking        than    not.         This       having        been        said,       there        was        not

              too m u c h        rowdy       behaviour        at     t hi s     point.            From       th is    point          in time

               ri g h t    through          until     after     3    p.m.       a    laFgl? n u m b e r         of    supporters               having

              gone        to    the    ground,        were    returning             along         Leppings           Lane       asking

queueing        supporters               for       ’s p a r e ’ t i c k e t s .              So    it w a s        easy       as    of    t h is

time     to    form     the       opinion              t h at     a    l a rge     number          of    people            were     drunk        to

s ome    degree,        and an           unknown             number          of    people          were       not       in    possession

of    tickets.          About        2    p.m.          a train             ha d a r r i v e d         bringing            in s u p p o r t e r s

and     these       were     accompanied                  to      the       ground          by P o l i c e       Officers           (the     only

group     that       were).          Mounted Officers,                            and       a dog       van,       made       occasional

patrols        past     our       position.                  The       fact       that       the re w a s          this       amount       of

drinking        (and d r u n k e n n e s s ) s e e m e d                    to m a k e       it a       pointless             exercise

t hat    other       officers            in o t h e r           locations              were       searching             coaches          etc.

and     confiscating              a l c o h o 1.          Between            2    p.m.       and 3       p.m.         the     r oad

(Leppings           L a n e ) became           choked wit h                  p e o p l e , e v e n as 3               p.m.       approached

and     it w a s     evident         that          a     l a r ge      number          of     people        would          not     make     it

for     the    3 p.m.        kick        off,          notwithstanding                      that       some      of     them       did    not

have     official          tickets.

At    about     3    p.m.     Police           Sergeant                Reynolds             instructed             us      to a t t e n d at

the L e p p i n g s     Lane       end        of       the      ground,           believed assistance                         required

controlling            the    crowd           outs i de           t hat      end's          turnstiles.                 From       our

original        positions            we       could          see       a    l a r ge    mass       of    people            milling

about.         We    attended            that          l o c a t i o n a n d as             we a r r i v e d ,        we     caught       the

tail     e n d of     the     l a rg e        group          of       people       who       had fl ooded               in t h r o u g h     the

turnstiles           and     opened           gat es,           we     were       instructed             to      remove          the

remaining           people        trying           to ge t            in,    until          the    situation               had     cleared.

The     area was        cleared and                    the      perimeter              gates       closed          temporarily.                  A

certain amount               of    rowdiness                 among          the    crowd          left      outside           was      evident

at    t h is   time.         Having           b e e n at          the       l oc ation a short                   time,        members        of

my    serial        attempted            to    go       into          the    ground.              At    t ha t     ti me      it was

thought        because        of     a    public             order          situation,             s om e     of      us w e r e

prevented           from     doing        so       by an          Inspector             and       told      to     perform          crowd

control        immediately               outside             t he      ground.              We    did    this,          but      were

unaware        for    some        considerable                    t im e     of    the       situation             inside          the

             large amount                  dazed and          in sho ck,         some       were     ’w a l k i n g     w o u n d e d ’ who

             refused           further           assistance.              Those       of    us    outside         the    ground         did    not

             went        1   1 f d u t y at       Stainforth             at 8 . 1 5     p.m.      th at    evening.




E N D OF   REPORT
ground.        The   only     i nformation we      got was       gleaned      from     the

intermittent          't a n n o y 1 messages    from the       loudsp e a k e r     system.

For    the next one          and a half hours         the   trickle      of people        leaving      the

ground via the L e p pings             Lane   exits     became     a flood,        some were     drunk,       a

large    amount      dazed     and in shock,       some were        'walking wounded'            who

refused    further          assistance.       Those     of us outside          the    ground did not

find out       for at least half an hour what,                   if anything had h a p pened on

the    terraces.

As    it became      obvious     what    had happe n e d     those      of us a t tempting        to keep

some    sort    of order outside          the    ground,     and keep         the way clear       for

e m e rgency vehicles,          were    s u bjected     to a non      stop     torrent       of vehement

verbal    abuse       and    threats    from a good prop o r t i o n of the             crowd by now

leaving    the       ground,    this was      a fright e n i n g    situation         as we were       by

now vastly o u t n u m b e r e d by a p o t e n t i a l l y hostile           mass    of distr e s s e d

people .

Eventually       the    crowd    cleared,       we were     de-br i e f e d    in the     ground.      Went

for a meal       at C l aywheels        Lane,    were    transp o r t e d back        to Doncaster.           I

went    off duty at S t a i n f o r t h at 8.15          p.m.    that    evening.

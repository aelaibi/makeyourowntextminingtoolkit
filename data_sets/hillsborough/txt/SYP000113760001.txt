            About       1130 hours    that day together with PS Lomas                       I paid particular

            attention to Wads ley Lane at its junction wiJm Middlewood Road, as

they were         drunk and w ould               be tu r n e d away from the               gates.

Shortly        I heard a r a d i o - m e s s a g e         that    led me       to believe                   that    the kick

obvious        to me      that at         this    stage       s o m ething    was    d r a s t i c a l l y wrong.

I went       down to the              ground at       the L e p p i n g s    Lane    entrance                 to the West

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?        X.    ^   ___         ^          ^            „    __

THE POLICE FORMED A CORDON ROUND THE QROUN>p WHICH WASN'T NECESSARY, THEY

SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING AT THE OTHER END.          IN FACT THEY WERE APPROACHED BY

SOME FANS CARRYING INJURED PEOPLE BUT THE OFFICERS JUST IGNORED THEM *

WHEN I LEFT THE FIRE ENGINES WERE BLOCKING EXIT GATE »A’ AND MADE IT DIFFICULT

TO GET OUT.     IF THERE HAD BEEN A MASS EXODUS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATER

PROBLEMS.

T ® OFFICERS STANDING AROUND COULD NOT ONLY HAVE HELPED WITH BODIES BUT WITH

PULLING THE FENCES DOWN.     THE IMPRESSION I GOT WAS THAT THE MAJORITY OF POLICE

THOUGHT IT WAS CROWD TROUBLE.     BUT VERY SOON THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE

SOMETHING WAS HAPPENING SEEING THE DEAD BODIES.           THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION

BETWEEN THE POLICE.

SEEMED TO BE A LAtTK^OF PROFESSIONAL FIRST AID ON HAND.,

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU         TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                             ,               ^

T^p ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND frAS^FOOR IN COMPARISON WITH LAST YEAR.

LAST YEAR QUEUES WERE FORMED BY THE POLICE EVEN LATE ON.                 ALSO LAST YEAR

TICKETS WERE CHECKED AWAY FROM THE GROUND AND WE WERE FILTERED THROUGH.                     WHEN

I GOT IN THE GROUND I WAS AGITATED & UPSET AND APPROACHED 6 - 7                OFFICERS

STANDING THERE.     I APPROACHED THEM I EXPLAINED TO          THEM THEM WHAT WAS      HAPPENING

THEY WERE POLITE BUT UNCONCERNED.        MY HUSBAND GOT       IN WITHOUT HIS TICKET BEING

CHECKED & THAT IS WRONG.

ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE             UPSET AND CRYING &      THE

POLICE WERE NOT GIVING ENOUGH COMFORT.

THE TANNOY SYSTEM NEEDED TO BE BETTER & USED MORE.                THE KICK--OF.F SHOULD HAVE

BEEN DELAYED.

 YES, THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS THE LACK OF PROPER CRC^D CONTROL OUTSIDE THE GROUND,

 THE FACILITIES FOR ENTRY TO THE GROUND WERE INADEQLh^JE FOR SUCH A LARGE

 CROWD, THE TURNSTILES BEING CONFINED TO A VERY SMALL AREA.

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4.20 PM (1620).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 <5®buDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS, OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS
                              'Ns
 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS Sl'ft^PED?

 THERE WEREN’T SUFFICIENT MEDICAL PEOPLE OR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.     I COULD

 N W UNDERSTAND WHY A LARGE NUMBER OF POiylCEj FORMED A LINE DOWN THE

 LENGTH OF THE PITCH FACING THE NORTH STAND WHEN SUPPORTERS WERE RUNNING

 ABOUT WITH INJURED FANS ON STRETCHERS AND HOARDINGS,   I THOUGH THIS WAS A

 TERRIBLE WASTE OF RESOURCES.     I AM SURE THE POLICE WOULD HAVE HAD MORE

 EXPERIENCE IN TREATING THE INJURED FANS THAN THE SUPPORTERS.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 MY ONLY OTHER OBSERVATION FOR FIXTURES OF THE NATURE WITH VERY LARGE

 CROWDS IS THAT STADIUMS SHOULD BE ALL SEATING ONLY.

Q 17

 Q49

 D ^ YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 OUTSIDE THE GROUND, THE CROWD ORGANISATION WAS EXTREMELY CHAOTIC =

 THE POLICE APPEARED TO HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE OUTER PERIMETER OF THE GROUND

 BY BLOCKING THE SIDE ROADS, BUT FAILED TO GIVE AS MUCH ATTENTION ACTUALLY AT

.& OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STpP’FED?

 THE ORGANISATION AFTER THE MATCH WAS STQJmED         WAS NON-EXISTANT. PEOPLE WERE

 WORKING ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE    TRYING TO ASSIST        THE INJURED & DYING,BUT   I

 THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVE IF THE RESCUE ATTEMPT COULD HAVE BEEN

 CO-ORDINATED.                                   __
                                         O   n                                 _

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH    TO ADD WHICH      YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 BECAUSE OF THE SHEER VOLUME OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY A SEMI-FINAL GAME WHERE

 PEOPLE ARE NOT AWARE OF THE LAYOUT OF THE GROUND, THE ORGANISATION FROM THE

 €|0p, VIA THE STEWARDS, THE POLICE, THE FA, WAS EXTREMELY LACKING. MAYBE TOO

 MUCH WAS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE AWARE OF WHERE THEY WOULD BE

 GOING.

 THE TICKET TOUTS SHOULD BE CLAMPED DOWN ON, WHICH IN TURN WOULD DISCOURAGE

 PEOPLE ARRIVING AT THE GROUND WITHOUT A TICKET.

 MEDICAL FACILITIES WERE BASCIALLY NON-EXISTENT, BOTH F AC ILITIES-WISE (OXYGEN

 ETC) + ACTUAL MEDICAL STAFF AVAILABLE, WERE LACKING.

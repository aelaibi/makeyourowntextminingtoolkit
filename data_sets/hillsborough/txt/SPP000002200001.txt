      Your ref: SLP/LL

      Dear Stefan,

              Thank you very much for showing me your excellent analysis of the law. I have a few comments.

      1.     I am not sure that it is not too complicated for the Jury, especially if it forms part of a long
             summing-up. This may be a bit too detailed and intellectual for them and I would be inclined not
             to cite individual cases.

      2.     On page 16, you say that gross negligence is not enough for manslaughter. I think this is a rather
             risky thing to say, as it implies there is a distinction between gross negligence and recklessness.

      3.     I think there should be somewhere in the direction, a statement to the effect that the Jury must
              accept the directions on the law which you give them, whether they agree with them or not, but
              that they are free to form their own view as to the facts, whether they agree with your view or not.

      4.     I think somewhere on page 8 you should say that mere carelessness is not enough.

      5.     I think, again on page 8, the words "has actually caused" are possibly ambiguous.            "Was a
              substantial cause" might be better.

               I presume that in your summing-up you will apply the guide-lines, including your excellent
      discussion on the importance of the emergency and the allowances that you make, to each of the putative
      defendants in turn.

              I shall be thinking of you next week and I hope it all goes well.

                                                           Yours sincerely,

                                       P o^cAa                      ^V w      \T\JUf

I nin now g oing to turn to giv in g you. fi nu mber of: d.i reot i.ono

on     issues of      law.    As yon will    ?“ p in a moment,        a m a j ority

of the       time wi ll be occupied with aspects              relating     to a

possibl e v e r d i c t of un la wfully Killed-           You are not       t.f>

constru e this         as meaning that      I am d i recting you eithe r

towards or a w a y from that part i c u l a r verdict,              it is simply

that the       legal concepts       and aspects w hich have to be

consi d e r e d are a.        numerous,     b.   comp l e x    c.   important and

d.     dif fe r
              in ce rtain respects from those a pplicable                    to
              <?3di-i
some of t h e ^ v erdicts whi ch ma y be open to you.

However,       be f o r e   I get down to that,     I w ish to d r a w yo ur

a t t ention to the provi si on of the Co roners Act 1988 Sect i o n

11     (5)   (b).

Furthermore,          see Section 6 of that Act.



As an a side I should perhaps m e n t i o n that this am en dment

was i ntroduced in 1977 pi'ior to that,                it had been possi bl e

for c o r o n e r s ' juries to name peo pl e who         they thoug ht had

been gui lt y of murder,           manslaughter' or infanticide.

In a d d i t i o n ‘to the Act of Parliament,          there are also Rules

w hich app ly to coroners and the cu rrent rules                    are the 19 84

cor on er s    rules.

I ther ef or e now dra w your atte nt io n to Rule 36.                 This rule




BAFAAG
                                    2



reads as       foll ow s: -




The eff ec t of this rule is that ne ither you nor                 I are

allow ed to pu t on to the inqui si ti on wha t used to be known

as   'l'iders'     i.e.,      advice or comments.

I am also r e q u i r e d to draw to you r at te ntion Rule 42.



It is ess e n t i a l   that the provi si on s     of this rule together

wi th the provisiions of Rule 36               (b) are strictly a d h e r e d   to

by you an d ind ee d by me.



SELF IN CRIMINATION.



I also w i s h to dra w y ou r a t t ention to Rule 22.            This

r e a d s :-

        1.     "No wi tness at an inquest shou ld be obli g e d to

                an s w e r any ques ti on te nding to incriminate

                himself.

        2.     Where    it appears      to the coro n e r that the witn es s

               has been asked such a question,            the co roner shall

               inform the w i t n e s s ’that he m a y refuse to answer".



This     is an exceed i n g l y important rule and is fund em en ta l to




BAFAAG
                                         3




the p r e s e n t s y s t e m of justice in the Unit ed K i n g d o m . ..

You m a y have notic ed that some of the witn es se s were, told

of the rule and of the pr iv ilege to w h i c h               they wer e

entitled and         some exer ci se d their rights.            Put anot h e r way,

a wi tness        has a right of silence.



RIGHTS OF SILENCE.



It w o u l d be gr ossly unfa ir and quite c o n trary to the

inten ti on of the rule and indeed to justice if you we re                           to

construe a re fusal to answer a q u e stion under the priv il eg e

as an a d m i s s i o n or an indic at io n of guilt.            To c o n strue the

pri v i l e g e   in such a wa y w ould not only run contra to the

w h o l e p r i n c i p l e of the rule but w o u l d in effect pla ce the

person w h o exe r c i s e d the p r ivilege in a far w orse po sition

than if he had in fact a n s wered the question.

The p o s i t i o n is simply this:-           Tha t you m a y not c o n s t r u e

silence as c o n s tituting any part of the evide nc e on which

y o u r d e l i b e r a t i o n s are based.   You have to be s a tisfied

from the e v i d e n c e which yo u have heard and not from

evidence w h i c h you have not heard nor ma y you dra w any

infere nc es       from the exer ci se of the privilege.               Und er no

circu m s t a n c e s mus t the pr ivilege be turned into a noose.



VERDICTS.



I no w re m i n d you of the po ssible ver di ct s whi ch you might

                                      _ 4 -




be able to c o n s i d e r in res pe ct of these inquests



      1-    U n l a w f u l l y killed.

      2.    A c c i d e n t a l death or m i s a d v e n t u r e   (I will tell you

            now that in law,              there is no diff er en ce between

            these two terms.              We will deal wit h this          in a

            little more detail             later on) .

 ?    3.    A special verd ic t w h i c h again              I will deal with      a

            little later on.

      4.    What    is known as an open verdict.



ST ANDARD OF PROOF.



In c o n s i d e r i n g the evidence,      you o b v i o u s l y will have to be

satisfied tha t the ne cessary st andard of proof has been

a c h ieved in o r d e r to enable you to rea ch one or oth er of

the v e r dicts w hich I have mentioned.                   D i fferent standards

of proof ar e requ ir ed for dif f e r e n t verdicts.                  If I may

sum marise first of all,            in re spect of the ve rdict of

u n l a w f u l l y ki l l e d you have to be s a tisfied to the stand ar d

w h ich ca n be de scribed as the crimi na l                 sta nd ar d of proof.

In respect of accidental dea th or m i s a d v e n t u r e              (or a

special verdict)         the standard wou Id be that of the ba lance

of pro ba bi li ty .     In the case of an open ver di ct there is in

a sense no standard           for the-r ea so ns w h i c h you will see

later on.




BAFAAG
                                      5



C R I MINAL STANDARD.




Let us then deal           in a little mor e detail with the standard

of proof r e q u i r e d      for unla w f u l l y killed.     Before you are

able   to b r i n g    in a verdict of u n l a w f u l l y killed,         you bovp

to be s a t i s f i e d beyond re as onable doubt            (or to put it in

sligh tl y m o r e modern language,           you   have to be satisfied                  so

that you are          sure)    that the e v i dence which you have heard

and w h i c h yo u are cons idei'ing, satisfies you                 that both            the

act and n e c e s s a r y mental state of the crimi na l offence

whi ch you are co ns idering has been mad e out.



In resp e c t of the other verd ic ts ex c e p t of cours e an open

ve rdict the stand ar d of proof             is the lower one norma ll y

d es c r i b e d as the balance of pr ob ability.              It will be

obvious     to y o u therefore that a ve ry muc h hi gher standard

of proof     is require d be fore you ca n b r i n g in a verd i c t of

u n l a w f u l l y killed.



ORD ER OF CONSIDERATION.



As a d i r e c t co ns equence of this the ord er in w h i c h you

consi d e r the verd ic ts be comes          important.       In c o n s i d e r i n g    the

verdicts,      yo u have to ap ply you r m ind to the ver di ct of

u n l a w f u l l y killed first of all.         You have to c o n sider the

verdict in resp ec t of each of the deceased.                       You have to

apply the      facts wi thin the co ntext of the law as expl ai ne d

alr ea dy said upon the ev idence w h i c h you have h e a r d .




UNLAWFULLY      KILLED       - INTRODUCTION-



What then are the legal pa ra meters or req ui re me nt s              that

have to be met        in the conte xt of these inquests bef or e yon

are able to c o n sider a verd ic t of u n lawfully killed.

I do not p r o p o s e to take you thro ug h the whole            law of

mu r d e r or m a n s l a u g h t e r but for the pur po se s of these

inquests the criminal e quivalent of the verdi ct of

u n l a w f u l l y killed is one of the      forms of invo lu nt ar y

m a n s l a u g h t e r and by de fi nition exclu de s wha t we kno w to be

m u r d e r or any o ther aspects of d e l i b e r a t e killing.        The

legal requ i r e m e n t s    for this type of m a n s l a u g h t e r have been

co n s i d e r e d in various cases and in part i c u l a r a cas e known

as R - v - W est London Coro n e r Ex par te Gray.                In that case

w hich d e a l t w i t h an alleg ed unla wf ul kill in g by a polic e

of ficer by neglect,           Lord Jus ti ce Wa tkins    set out the

matt er s w h i c h a jury have to be sa ti sfied on beyond

r e asonable doubt.

Be fore I go th rough the points             I should add that alt ho ug h

in that p a r t i c u l a r case the- issue relat ed to negl ec t on the

part of the police,            the fundamental prin ci pl es of the

        verdict.



        You. have    to be satisfied of the foll ow in g points in the

        first i n s tance



               1.    Tha t the person wh ose cond uc t you are c o n s i d e r i n g

                     had a duty^ to have regar d to                          the health and

                     w e l f a r e say safety of the deceased^. *l



               2.    That       in the ci rcumstances,                    there was a failure           to

                     do wha t should have been d o n e ^ f o r the healt h and

                     of death.



               4.    Tha t the failure a m o unted to recklessness.



               5.    Recklessness means                        that there was an obvious            and

                     serious riskjfto the health and we lfare                                (safety)

                       nothing about        it.



      6.     It mus t be cle ar ly u n d e r s t o o d how ev er   that a

             failur e to appr ec ia te that there was such a risk

             w o u l d not by itself be suffi ci en t to amount to

             recklessness.



      7.     You can only return a verdict of unlaw f u l l y killed

             if you can attribute these in gr edients to a single

             indi vi du al whose con du ct          is being ca lled   in

             question.       Such an indi vi du al      should on no

             acco u n t be named or o t h erwise         identified.




CAUSATION.



The next p o i n t that I think I have to m e n t i o n is the issue

'Causation'.         You have to be sa tisfied that the act or

would give rise to liability.                    For ex ample it co uld be

argued that no -body wou ld have died if the game of football

were not p l a y e d in the United K i n g d o m or,         bri ng in g it

sl ightly n e a r e r home,          if there was no F.A.     Cup competition.

I think w o u l d we have any d i f f i c u l t y in excl ud in g them as

caus in g t hese deaths bec au se the y are ob v i o u s l y too remote.

In oth er words,       you have to be s a t i s f i e d that the act or

omniision w h i c h you are looking at is -



       a.    s u f f i ciently close,   s u f f i c i e n t l y related   to the

            e v e n t as to be l o g ically cla s s i f i a b l e as causatiire

RISK & RE CKLESSNESS.




R e c k l essness   is at the heart of a verd i c t of unlawful

killing.      In addition to wha t       I have alre a d y told you           I

th ink it m i g h t be helfpul       if I i llustrated the legal

a p p r o a c h by refer en ce to wh at was said in an other leading

case w h i c h is known as R - v - Lawrence.                The details of

that cas e do not concern us but it m a y help to unde r s t a n d

wh at is m e a n t by recklessness       if I give you a co u p l e of

quotes.



The   first one is from Lord Hailsham.                He says whe n speak in g

about the w ord reckless t h a t :-



       "Unlike m ost En glish words          it has been in the engl i s h




BAFAAG

       la nguage as a word in gener al use at least since the

      e ig ht c e n t u r y   .10 .'•-almost always wit h the same m e a n i n g

      a p p l i e d to personal conduct,         as a state of mind

      st o p p i n g short of d e liberate       intention and going

      be yo nd mer e inadvertence".



Lord Dipl o c k comments         "that the w o r d          not acquired   n

special m e a n i n g as a term of legal syr. but mor e            its popular

or d i c t i o n a r y mean i n g of ^are.les^    re gardless or heedless

of p o s sible harmful conse qu en ce s of ones            act".   He goes on

to say:-



       "One does not speak of a pe r s o n actin g reckl e s s l y even

       though he has given no th ought at all to the

       c o n s e q u e n c e s of his ac t. .. unless   the act is one that

       presents      a real risk of ha rmful co ns eq uences whi ch

       an y o n e acting with reaso n a b l e pr udence w ould recog ni se

       and give heed t o " .



Lord D i p l o c k also says:-




       "Recklessness on the part of the doe r of an act does

       p r e s u p p o s e that there    is s o m ething in the

       ci r c umstances that would have draw n the attenti on of

       an o r d i n a r y prudent   in dividual to the p o s s i b i l i t y that

       his act was capable of caus i n g the kind of serious,

       harmful co ns equences'that         t;he section w h i c h creates

       the o f f e n c e was intended to pr event and that the risk

       of tho se harmful co ns eq uences occ u r r i n g was not so

       s.light that an ord in ar y pr udent        individual would

       feel    justi fi ed in tr eating them as negligable.

       It is o n l y when this     is so    that   the doer of the act:, in

       a c t i n g re ck lessly if before d oing the act he either

       fails to give any thought           to the p o s s i bility of

       the re b eing any such risk or having re cognised that

       there was such a risk he ne ve rt heless goes on to

       do i t " .



Alth o u g h as   I say,   the pr ecise details      are of no concern

of ours,      you m a y be interested to k n o w that it was a case

which dea lt w ith the issue r e l ating to reckless dr iving and

one of the aspects which the law lords were a p p l y i n g their

minds to was        the dis ti nc ti on b e t w e e n an offence of reckless

driving a n d dr iving with ou t due care and attention.

It seems      to m e that not e very a s s u m p t i o n of a ri sk can

t h erefore be descr ib ed as bein g reckless          for example,       every

ope r a t i o n p e rformed by a surgeon carries w ith it the

inevitable ris k of injury as well as a risk of other

adverse co ns eq uences      including in some cases,         death.      This

risk in m a n y cases      is both obvio us     and serious and can

occur h o w e v e r competent the. o p e r a t i o n is in fact carr ie d

out.

prosecuted          for ma ns la ughter bec au se          in the events      the

patient     had died.



S u m m a r i s i n g then again,    recklessness           is defin ed a s :-



       1.    There has to be an obvi ou s                  and serious riskC to            the

             he a l t h and welf ar e of                                    that has

             b.        Recognising the ris k has de cided to go on

                      and take i t .



Before h o w e v e r coming to the            d e f i n i t i o n of reck le ss ne ss      in

this type of           case,    as I have alre a d y indicated there are

Firstly,    in co ns idering these aspects of re ck lessness                    the.i

is a ver y inter es ti ng case which was de cided b y the P r i v y

Council    and in which one of the La w Lords,                  known as Lord

Roskill    gav e the leading judg em en t           (explain that Privy

Council    ju dgements are not b i n d i n g in En glish co urts but

invol ve d the coll is io n of two h ydrofoils               in Hong Kong in

 You w i l l : see that this pa ssage in some wa y mir ro rs what; 7

have a l r e a d y indicated to you r e g a r d i n g crisis situa ti on s

I'm: e m e r g e n c y   i.e.,   you are en titled and indeed must         take

Into acco u n t all the c i r c u m s t a n c e s .      This point      is backed
                                                                                     (
up to a c e r t a i n extent by an other Lord,            Lord Edmund Davis

who    in R - v - Caldwell            says   "in the absence of e x c u l pakory

factors        the defendent's         stake of min d    is there fo re all

important w h e r e recklessness             is an el ement   in   the offe nc e

charged".           In other words,        if there are no excuses which

are l e g i t i m a t e and proper then the state of min d is an all.

important         factor.

Finally on this point it is p o s s i b l e to imagine a situation

where a p e r s o n perceives a situation,              assesses      it as not

c o n s t i t u t i n g an obvious and serio us       risk situation at all,

       Indeed to a certain extent this seems to be the case in

respect of ne a r l y all the parties wh o immed ia te ly befo re

the incident if asked, w ould have I— think,                  w o u l d have said

that the y felt the use of the s t a d i u m was reas o n a b l y safe

for the a d m i s s i o n of spectators         to the semi-final match.

This m a y have b een based on various                as su mptions    as to wha t

or w o u l d not happen but it forms a basis of.thei r belief.

If you w e r e to find that this appl i e d then that person

would not          fall within either of the two limbs of the

d e f i n i t i o n of recklessness because he w ould have applied

his min d         to the risk situation.          In other words he w ould

not have bee n indifferent to it and ha v i n g decided that

there was          no risk could not be d e s c r i b e d as having seen it,

  d e l i b e r a t e l y w ent on to take   it




  One of the inte re st in g features of the Hills bo ro ug h

  disaster      from a legal point of vie w is the di fference

 between this           and many of    the oth er disas te rs which            have

 u n f o r t u n a t e l y occurred in recent     times.      For instance you

 think of       the zlkrugge Disas te r        (passengers kille d on a ship

 which sa i l e d wit h open bo w doors or the Keg wo rt h Disas te r

 when an en g i n e caught fire and the w rong engine was

 swi tch ed off or the Lockerbie             Dis as te r whe re a bomb was

 placed on an aircraft or some of the train accidents which

 have r e c e n t l y occur re d or the M a n c h e s t e r Air D i s a s t e r ) .   in

 all of these the people who we re kill ed wer e in a sense

 e n t i r e l y helpless.     The y had noth i n g whate v e r to do w ith

the fl ying of the planes,             ru nning of the trains,           the

s ailin g of the ship,          op er ation of the bo w doors.             in the

H i l l s b o r o u g h Disa st er the p o s ition is slig ht ly diff er en t

in that the re is a ver y ac tive i n terplay bet we en all the

par ties     involved,       and at least the si tu ation ou tside the

tur n s t i l e area and po ssibly even the situation wi t h i n or on
the t e r r a c e s .

Fi nally be f o r e      you can bri ng in such a verdict,              you have

to be sat i s f i e d beyond reas on ab le doubt that the

r e c k l essness w hich you are c o n s i d e r i n g is attributable to

one sin gl e person.          What this me ans       is that you m a y not

 req u i r e m e n t s which I have t'r*iech-te« ou t l i n e ^ f o r you.        If yon

 decide          that the verdict of u n l a w f u l l y ki lled is

 .uiappropriate            in respect of some or all of the deceased,

 Wien j.n resp e c t of those you w.U.l then have to proceed                          to

 the o t h e r verdicts.

 Before          I disc us s these   I should   just men ti on one other

 point and that is the question of corp or at e                  liability.

There      has bee n a lot of argument           as to whet h e r it is

possible           for the company     to h a v e acted   j.n such a w a y that.

 (.he v e r d i c t of unla wf ul ly killed be re turned           in respe ct of'

its c o n d u c t .

To a c e r t a i n extent these argum en ts         have been settled and

the pres e n t position is that             if a c o m p a n y is to be liabJe

the d i r e c t i n g min d of the c o m p a n y ^ f u l f i ] V the crit er ia of

u n l a w f u l l y killed in ex actly the same way as if the co mpany

were an individual.              it follows that the only issue w h i c h

you have           to decide is what or who       is the di recting m i n d of

the company.             The posit io n seems to be that not eve ry

employee           of the company w o u l d fulfil that term but that                 a

di r e c t o r     or senior mana g e r who has the runni ng of the

affairs of the company w o u l d fulfil those criteria.                          As   it

happens          in this particula r inquest,       we have diff er en t          forms

of c om p a n i e s w hich I do not think you need to be too

con c e r n e d about but by wa y of example you might be prepared

to take the vie w for instance that Dr.                   Eastwoo d whose

comp a n y is known as Eastwood and Partners wou ld c o n s t i t u t e

M ac kr el l    in respect of She f f i e l d Wednesday.

I am ver y m u c h more doubtful as to wh ether it w ould be

possib le       for you to reach the co nc lusion           that Mr.    Bounds

was s u f f i c i e n t l y elevated   to const i t u t e a dire ct in g mind

and will of Sheff ie ld Cit y Council^ a-w-e/^yon should also

apply      inc l u d i n g the rules    acrainst aggregating.

If you c ome to the concl us io n           that u n lawfully       killed     i.s

i n a p p r o p r i a t e then you m a y go on to decide whe th er a

verdict        of accidental dea th or m i s a d v e n t u r e is appropriate.

In this case the burden of proof                is e n t irely different.

You m a y b r i n g in such a verdi ct        if you       are satisfied on

the b a l a n c e of probabilities.          In oth er words,      if you are

sa t isfied that it is more like ly than not that the

d ec eased's      death was due to accident or misadventure.

There is no differ en ce in the m e a n i n g of these two words.

You m a y c h o s e whichever you         prefer,    but    I w o u l d ad vise you

that if you          wer e considering these verdicts,,            if you can

not m a k e a decision on w h i c h w o r d you prefer,           you m a y feel

You s h o u l d understan d m e quite clea r l y that the              wor d

            I went to the Liverpool against Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi final

            football match,       held at Sheffield Wednesday's Ground at Hillsborough,

            Sheffield on Saturday 15th April >9B9.   (150489)
                              OVT*        _
            I am a regular supporter of J^lverpool football club and attend all of

            their home matches,

            On Saturday the 15th of April           1989 (150489)        I travelled to the match

            by car with three of my friends.             The driver of the car is known to me

            as           , I don't know any further details other than he is a police

            officer with Merseyside Police.

O&TJ\Q      Liverpool.        I don* t^fiow his full a d d r e s s , and

                                             , Liver po ol .   Both                   work at the

            same      place as Iftyse1f .

            On the morning       I travelled by train from Liverpool            to West Kirby with
                                                                                PAGE


        and then met                    outside the station at West Kirby.

They were in the car waiting for         us and we set off for Sheffield at

about    10 am.     (1000)

On the way to Sheffield we had a         stop of      about 10minutes at a garage

before reaching the Pennines but         I d o n ’t   know theenact     location.           Th

car was playing up a little h*n, we continued our journey but met with
C-/yT                      jS
traffic jams on the end o'? the M62 immediately before Manchester.  The

motorway was c o n e d a n d      cut down to two lanes.      I think they were

extending the motorway at this        point.    The jam was very heavy with

slow moving and       sometimes stationary vehicles.       We left the motorway

and rejoined at       a roundabout but back into the same jam.          I would

estimate that this jam delayed us for about           1 and a half h c ru rs.
                                                               Pfis.
When/Je    reached a valley in the Pennines we stopped f ojjr a drink at a

         I don't know the name or exact        location but UC was about 20

Minutes drive from the Hillsborough ground.           We only stayed about 13

minutes because       of the lack of time due to the traffic hold ups.

We arrived in Sheffield at about        1.30 pm (1330) and parked the car on

the road with many other supporters*           cars about three-quarters of a

mile from the ground to the west of the stadium.             I don*t know the

exact    location but it was on a straight        road from the Pennines.

We then walked from the car to the ground and had a ten minute game of

footbairl on the field next to the stadium at the Leppings Ln end.                     We

played for only a short time and then walked from the field to Xpi

turnstile entrance at Leppings Ln.          I arrived at the turnstil e s at

about 2 y ’f3 pm.     (1415)   I had not seen any fans drinkingXor

misbe/vav i ng on the way from the car to the ground.

We did not see or received any police escort during our travels.

When we arrived at the turnstile entry point           in Le^pings Ln at about

2.15 pm (1415)      there was already a large massyrfr fans around the

turnstiles.       They were not in orderly queues but were eager to get
                                                                                  PAGE       3
                                                                                  51537

through the^turnsti les but there was no real             pusj>#fig and no

discomfort.     I only saw one uniformed pol>«£e officer           in this area and

he was standing by the end turnsti le/'entry just             inside the single

metal   barrier on the river side of the turnstile block.               He did not

appear to be directing fans but was merely standing there.                    I d i d n ’t

see any other officers about and did not see any club stewards.

I only waited a few minutes and was able to get through the turnstiles

with    comparative ease.     Once    inside the turnstiles      I met up with

as                      had gone into the main stand area through other

turnstiles.

Immediately inside the g r o u n ^ a n d by the turnstile area I was s^a rc he d
C >vt    €>©£>"-/ s        Crtt£.Sr   &y
by a uniformed police offiicer                  as not, as there was afily one

police officer there,

I did not see a n o t h e r   gates open as I entered the ground and did not

witness any gates being opened once            I was   in the ground.    I had not

seen any unauthorised entry to the ground and upon entering the

turnstile I had handed in my ticket.

Having been searched by the police officer we               looked for entrance B

which was on our ticket and we saw a letter B displayed at the front

of a tunnel directly opposite the turnstiles.

I purchased a programme from a man who was selling               programmes against

the perimeter wall       inside the around by the turnstile area and then

     and I walked over to tbr§ tunnel.
                    Kvi      VST
We entered the tunnel together and on reaching the terrace end moved

to our left and into/Pen 4.           Other   people were    in the tunnel but we

had used it witho^/t being obstructed or seeing any unusual                  incident.

As we entered pen J* we moved just a couple of steps down the terrace

and three or f^ttr feet to the left of the tunnel.

The moment we took our place we could see that the pen was full                     from

front to back.        People were already standing shoulder to shoulder and
                                                                             PAGE         4
                                                                             SI 53"/

the time of      our entry was abo y X 2 .20    pm.(1420)

More    people   were coming   in^o the pen     behind us and wewere      pushed over

to our left      and down the terrace.

I could see      that the area next to us and     to our left was cornparati vely

empty and I tried to move towards that area.                   was just   in front

of me.
                                                o a t      f'V O2-0J
As I tried to move towards the clearer area J/here was a slight

of the crowd which pushed us past a b a n n e r         at the side.   TNe pressure

from the crowd eased slightly and L/Tound that             I was the pitch side of

the barrier so I shouted to Mike to stay as we would be alright with

the barrier behind.

At this time     I did not see or appreciate that we         were in fact in a      pen

with a fence     preventing us moving along the terrace.

 ust as we got in front of the barrier         I looked at/the     roll on

advertising screen and saw that the time was 2/55 pm.              (1455)

As soon as I had looked at the clock there yfa.% areal

of the crowd     from behind me.    That's whepr I lost            he just

disappeared from m e .

My arms were pinned at my chest and my head was reaching towards the

sky and the sweat was      pouring off us.     The crowd didn't seem to ease

back to let us down again and I felt very frightened and restricted

and had difficulty breathing.

I could see a police officer on the pitch in front of us and at the

back of the goals,     the game had now just kicked off and it was getting

tighter and tighter all the time.

I and all the other fans around me started screamj^fg out for someone

to open the gates in the front fence.  We wej>edirecting our calls to
               ^o^tOfc£__ /y-r                          Oz£,
the policeman but he seemed to look away/'and deliberately ignore us.

A man in front of me started crying and people were screaming for

help,    asking for someone to get them out, anyone.
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S1537

I then saw a few fans     climbing sCwer the front perimeter fence from the

terraces and two or three paticemen on the pitch side were stopping

them from getting over.,      '

One of the fans satyon the top of the fence and he was pulling fans

out with him.      /

The policemen then let the fans onto the pitch but kept the fans

behind the goal.

I saw a policeman on the fence,       over the gate,    pulling fans across   the

fence but he didn't open the gate for them to come through.

I then saw a man in front of me on the       crush barrier nearer the pitch

screaming for people to stop pushing.        It was that packed we could n’t

do anything to stop.      I was   pushed against him.

I then felt a body coming across the top of us from behind and           his leg

got trapped across my face and I c ou ld n’t move my head,      then I

could n’t breathe.

I d o n ’t know if the body was unconscious    or not or how it had got over

me.     I couldn’t see because of his leg in my face.

Somehow the body was pulled further down the terrace and I was able to

take a gasp of air,    not proper breathing,    just a sharp gasp.

Suddenly a man in front of me was pushing       me back from the barrier to

help me to breathe and for some unknown reason the crowd seemed to

ease for a split second and the man screamed at me to get under the

bar and I was able to do so and stand up again.

Everyone was still     screaming and I saw three men against the barrier

where    I had been.

One was bent towards me over the bar with his arms dropped over and

the bar across his stomach.

I tried to push him back as someone had done for me and I shouted at

people behind him to try and stop pushing.

I was eventually able to get the three men under the bar.

I ca n ’t describe any of the people,   I was   in too much fear,       shock,

panic and fatigue.                              „                  i.

People were then climbing over W ye Pence to my left intj         an empty area.

Someone said to me,     "You're nyfct," and helped me a        the fence.

I turned around and looked back into the pen j^Td people were still

screaming with arms stuck through the fence wanting help.

I walked down the terrace to      the front fence and asked a policeman who

was standing with his arm across the gateway        to help.

I got onto the pitch and was      able to recover a little but was then

told to get off the pitch by      a policeman who said they             wanted to

start the game again.

I c oul dn’t believe   it.

1' could see bodies on the pitch   jmd Iran over to try and help,

We started ferrying people ayross the pitch on advertising boards and

taking them to the gymnasium at the back

There was a line of policemen across the pitch but even though fans

were asking for their help they remained in a line and as we ran with

the hoardings we had to run our way through the        police line.

When we got out there was just one ambulance attending the fans and

bodies everywhere.

I remained in the ground helping u.nXyi about 4.30 pm ( 1630) when I
          <^n~     P / \ I T T Y r V rv/O'
heard a louds peaker announcement y t e 11i ng us to keep hold of our

 ickets and leave the ground,/**     did so,

I feel very strongly that/there      was a 1a o l f o f communication and

organisation amongst the police      and j^ffewards,     both before the match

outside the ground and during a n >4/^after the disaster.

     Dear Sir,

     RE:     HILLSBOROUGH: ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY


     Thank you for your letter of 7 August 1998. I have indicated to the other solicitors that I
     propose to copy their correspondence to you unless they object.

     In relation to the final paragraph of your letter, I will ask Mr. Croston on his return to
     indicate whether there is material which is no longer in our possession and, if so, the nature
     of that material.




     Yours faithfully,




    Christopher H. Enzor
    Branch Crown Prosecutor

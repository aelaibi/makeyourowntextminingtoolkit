           slow moving          traffic after             leaving the M a n c h e s t e r /area.                I have

           t r a v e ll e d this way before and                  I knew that           this w o u l d     be the     case.           We

           arrived       in S h e f f e i l d a bout        12.30       pm and drove         to the ground.               I parked

           the    car    in a side          road off the A61 P e n i s t o n e             Road about a mile               from/

           the football          g/ound.            We wa lk ed back           towards     the ground and wen f/ in to

           a public: house on our                    left along whe P e n i s t o n e          road.       I can't        remember

           the    name    of/the       pub or wh^t make                 of beer     they sold.            The    place was

           p acked wit h Liverpool                  supporters.                     went     to the bar to buy the

           drinks       and    I heard the ystaff say they hadn't                          got any glasses            to servs

           the    beer    in so 1 tole                        to get me         b o t tl ed beer.         In the end we all

           had bott le d beer.              Everyone          in the      pub w e r e / d r i n k i n g   beer,    it Was a

5.o.e.     r eally good atmosphere,                    we were all            ha vi ng a good       laugh.        We «ot        in

Aux>ttn_   this      pub at about           12.50 and         left at         1.25/ pm.      I d i d n ’t see an yo n e          in

           there who was           o bv i o u s l y    drunk.       We    left     the    pub because           it was
occ^
           d i fficul t       to get    served and also,                 as    it was a nice day we d e c i d e d to

           get a few cans            from the off             licence         o pp os it ^ and drink        them out        in the

           sunshine.           I believe           that   the off        licence iwas one of the T h r e s h e r s

           group.        In this off             licence     there was          t m y female      staff,        one was

           serving       behind the             counter and the other was at the entrance

           r eg ul at ing      the flow of            people     in a nd out        of the      premises.          W hi l s t    I

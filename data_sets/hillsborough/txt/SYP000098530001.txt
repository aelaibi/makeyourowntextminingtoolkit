MIR 15
                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


FROM: Detective Inspector Cleverley
                                               DEPTs Hillsborough Enquiry
TO: Chief Superintendent Wain
                                               DATE: 8 August 1990


            SUBJECT:       Interim Report 6: Further enquiries
                           requested by Hammond Suddards

The attached fax letter dated 19 July 1990 from Hammond Suddards
requests that certain officers who gave evidence to the Taylor enquiry
be seen again to clarify their evidence concerning police duty or
responsibility for "monitoring" the pens at the Leppings Lane end.

The officers mentioned were:

            Chief Inspector Creaser (HQs Computer Development)
            Inspector Darling (F Division Community Liaison)
            Inspector Calvert (HQs Discipline & Complaints)
            Inspector Sewell (FI Sub Division)

I have interviewed all these officers at length, and ensured that they
re-read the transcripts of their evidence on the points mentioned in
Hammond Suddards' letter.

All officers, having considered the two questions on page 2 of the
letter, answer "yes" to 1 and "no" to 2.     In these circumstances they
do not feel able to give further statements on the lines suggested.    I
would summarise their view collectively as:         the whole of their
evidence to the Taylor enquiry, and not simply those isolated parts
questioned, reflects accurately their individual perceptions of the
police "monitoring" role on the fateful day.

In these circumstances I have not attempted to try and obtain statements
which would simply over complicate the issue without going as far as
Hammond Suddards might wish.

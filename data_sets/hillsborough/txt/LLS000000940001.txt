                           Hillsborough Disaster - Saturday 15th April 1989.




  My name is
                                                 I am married and live with my husband                              and my son                                        at
                                                            Liverpool,                         I want to talk about our visit to
  Sheffield on Saturday 15th April 1989. Our ages are
                                                                                                             espectively.

 We left Litherland at 09.30 hrs but did not arrive in Sheffield until just after 13.00 hrs
 because of an unusual amount of road works which caused a considerable delay.
 After a short visit to a caffe'to use the toilet facilities we made our way to the Ground at tl
 Leppings Lane end walking down the lane with the Ground on our right, after a short distance
 we crossed over the River Don, at this point the pavement is wery narrow and because of the
 heavy traffic it was not possible to walk in the road, we could only walk two abreast.
 As we came off the bridge we turned right to go through a gate which opens onto a tri-angular
 area which serves as an assembly point for the turnstiles, my husband who had a ground ticket
 left us here to make for the turnstiles which served the terracing, the time was then 13.30 h r
 I asked my son if he wished to go for a walk before taking our seats but he intimated that he
 would rather go in straight away, we stood looking for an information board or sign directing
 us to the Stand ( there were.no Stewards available at this time) when a Mounted Policeman who
 was positioned to my right snarled - if you are going in f                                               g well get in dr get to hell ou
 of it", at the same time he swung his horse round to force us to move through the gate.
 I asked the policeman "why did you do that?" and he again snarled at me, "go on get in" he sait
He had   previously spoken to 4 young boys (about 14 yrs) in the same manner, they were stood
with their backs to the bridge parapet and were                                            in no way impeding the progress of fans who at
this time were not in very great numbers. As we left to take our places we could hear him yet
again berating someone else.

When we took our seats in the Stand some people on the same row were remarking on his conduct
and the general consensus was that he was a "nut case".
from my seat in the Stand              I could see clearly across the terracing where theLiverpool fans
were, it was split up into 3‘areas with fencing at right angles to the perimeter the smallest
section appeared to be that                   immediately behind the goal. I could also see the clock on the
police control office which overlooked the Leppings Lane end of that terracing.
At 14.00 hrs it was very obvious that the centre section of the terrace was near to capacity
the way people were.swaying around at the front. By 14.30 hrs the position had worsened and I
was now very concerned as I was not sure just where on the terrace my husband was standing, my
son   said not to worry as he would have had enough experience to have avoided the centre area
of the terrace. This proved to be true because I found out later that when he entered the groun
(at 13.30 hrs) he had looked down the tunnel and "decided that thesection                                           behind the goal                                 was t;
packed so he went onto the terrace below the police office.

                                                                             ,»



    Within minutes they started to climb the perimeter fencing but the police were pushing them
    back, by now the game had started and more and more people were climbing over the perimeter
    fence onto the field but the police were still trying to force them back. Other fans were bein
    hauled up to the stand above.
    The game was stopped at 15.06 hrs but it                was15.20 hrs approx' before it appeared         that the
                 | «r £-% i ^   f i,

    police appeared to-be aware that something had gone seriously wrong and started to help fans
    over   the fences but nothing positive happened until the Tire Brigade arrived and seemed to
    take   control of the situation but even at this time the police were trying to stop fans from
    tearing down the advertising hoardings, I even heard one policeman shouting to his colleagues
    that the fans were tearing down the goal                nets as if someone was committing        an act of vandalism
    when in actual fact it was obvious that they were trying to make it easier                       for an ambulance tc
    approach the scene. I saw one policeman refuse to allow                       an ambulance   throughthecordon that
    the police had thrown aofross the centre of the field, it was forced to drivearound                        the
                                                                         e


    perimeter.
    I was concerned                for my husband's safety and sat scouring the terracing it was exactly 16.10 hi
    when   my son spotted him on the far side of the terrace, at this time they were still removing

    bodies from’.the field.

    I would now like to reflect on what I have written because I feel that there are some salient
    which need to be taken from it, they are listed below.                                                     [points
    1. Why was a route plagued with road works suggested as                       Mthe route"
      (Obvious the reason for so many late arrivals.)
^   2. Why is Leppings Lane not closed to traffic to permit the formation of orderly queues as at
       Anfield and Goodison Park. This in itself would relieve pressure on the turnstiles.
    3. If the Police act with such apprehension and uncertainty at 13.30 hrs how are they to reac:
    to the pressures which will become appreciably worse as kick-off time approaches. The partic-
    -ular police officer I have refered to was in a panic at that time and was not the ideal type

    to carry out duties of that particular nature.
    4. Why was the situation on the centre section not monitored between 13.30 hrs and 14.30 hrs
    If I was apprehensive about the situation in that period why were not the police or the

    Stewards.
    5. Why were so many policemen who were sorely needed on the terraces wasted on throwing a

    cordon across the field of play.
    6. Why in an age of sophisticated communications technology did "nobody speak to anybody .

    In conclusion I would like to say that we have visited Hillsborough in the past and have felt
    that it was a disaster waiting for the circmnstances to happen and that this factor X happens
    on the 15th April 1989 in that lots of fans arrived latebecause of delays                        on the road and t h
    police were insufficiently organised to contain the situation.
    further I would say that I have reported all I saw on that day I have left nothing out.

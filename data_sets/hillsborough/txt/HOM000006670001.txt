   HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATIONS BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

  I attach a note of a meeting which Lord Ferrers had with the West
  Midlands Police recently.

  2.   You will see that there was discussion about whether or not Mr
  Dear was conducting his investigation for Mr Wright or for Lord
  Justice Taylor's enquiry. Mr Dear's account of events is given in
  paragraph 2 of the minutes.

  3.   We also had a meeting with South Yorkshire Police Authority,
  at official level, recently. I also attach a note of that meeting.
  South Yorkshire - who were represented by the Clerk to the Police
  Authority and an ACC - did appear to recognise that the
  investigation was initiated by their Chief Constable, although they
  claim that it was subsequently "taken over" by Lord Justice Taylor
  to such an extent that South Yorkshire can no longer consider it
  theirs.   (That is an interpretation which they were unable in our
  view to substantiate at the meeting, although they did give some
  examples of the way in which the investigation had been somewhat
  broadened in order to assist Lord Justice Taylor.)

  4.   Lord Ferrers will be meeting members of the South Yorkshire
  Police Authority on 20 June. We do not know whether the Authority
  members will take the same line as their Clerk.   In preparing for
  the meeting it would be helpful to have as full a recollection as
  you are able to provide of the events which led up to the
  establishment of the West Midlands' investigation, including any
  conversations you had with Mr Dear and Mr Wright.

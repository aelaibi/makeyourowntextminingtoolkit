Dear Mr. Straw

HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

I write following a recent meeting of Liverpool City Council to
inform you that the Council unanimously resolved that I should
write to congratulate you on your decision to appoint Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith to investigate the new evidence which has emerged
about the Hillsborough Disaster.

As you know the City Council has for many years supported the
justice campaign of the- families of the victims through its
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party and all Members are therefore
extremely satisfied that at last there is to be an re-examination
of an issue which has caused immense pain here on Merseyside.


Yours sincerely




Committee Clerk - Hillsborough Disaster
Working Party

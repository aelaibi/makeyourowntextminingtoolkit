               I am a c onstable wit h            the S o ut h Y o r k sh ir e Police and since June                                1988 I

               have      been a Police T r a i n e r at the Force T ra i n i n g School,

               Ecc le sf i e ld ,    S heffield.



               At 9-4 3 am S a t u r d a y     IS April     1989,     I com me nc ed duty at the S h e f f i e l d

               W e d n e s d a y F oo tball   Ground,    Hillsborough,            Sheffield,        in r el ation to the

               F A Cu p Semi         Final    b e t w e e n Liverpool     a nd N o t t i n g h a m Forest,



               At      10.45 am the       same morning,      f ol lowing a briefing               by Chief

               Superintendent            D u c k e n f i e l d and other Se ni or Officers,               I was          deployed

               w i t h the    rest of my Serial          (Serial 58)         to    patrol. Herries R o a d ,

               S heffield,         from the Fiv e Arches Public H ouse                 to the       roundabout where

               Herr ie s     Road meets M o n s h i n e Lane.
D ur in g   that     time     I saw a        large    number        of N o t t i n g h a m Forr es t     s upporters

making      their way a l o n g         Herr ie s Road,          both on foot and             in vehicles

towards         the ground.          A substantial           p r op or ti on of these fans               had been

d rinking,         many    in the D e v o n s h i r e Arms an d Five Arches                   Public Houses

s i t u a t e d on Herries Road.



Approximately 3.10               pm the same date              I,    together wit h the other

o f f ic er s    on my serial,          were     passing       the front         of H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

Ground      on the way          to     the F orce coach           w h e n we a n s w e r e d an a s s i s t a n c e

call    f rom w i t h i n the ground.



On e n te r i n g    the g ro u n d we were            held w it h some 20 to 30 other officers

between         the N o rt h S t a n d a nd the Kop.



Some    three minu te s          later        S or 9 Dog H an dlers ente re d the ground                       an d

made    their way under                the N o r t h S tand       towards the L ep pings Lane

terrace,         only to      return several            minu te s      later.



A fter a n ot he r        short wait all             the officers         in the holding area were

d i r e c t e d on to the        p it c h.     Some were         sent     down to the Leppings               Lane

end a nd some,            mys el f    included,       were     sent     to stand facing            the

Nott i ngham Forrest             s up po r t e r s    in the K op.



At that         stage     I had no      idea of the          real      nature     or e no rmity of the

situation.



I saw,      a nd    indeed a s s i s t e d with,         the     ripping        up of the a dv e r t i s i n g

b oa rd in g a r o u n d the         pitch.     the boards were                taken to the Leppings

Lane    end an d        I saw    people       being     s tr e t c h e r e d   back across       the     pitch on
                                                                                                               PAGE         3
                                                                                                               S2305

these     boards.



A ft er a while a number                  of Liv er po ol       s up po r t e r s   ran towards      us    in an

a t t e m pt    to get to the N o t t i n g h a m F o r re st           supp or te rs       in the Kop.             Many

were     crying and           in an o b v i o u s l y d i s t r e s s e d state.           I tried to      calm and

console         these     fans a nd a s s i s t e d them back across                  the    pitch towards            the

Leppings         Lane     end.



The    next 40 minu te s            or so was          spent    s tood on the         pitch talking            to and

consoling          distressed           supporters.



A p p r o x i m a t e l y 4.05    pm the same           date an a n n o u n c e m e n t     was made      over       the

t an no y that          the m a t c h    had been abandoned.



As    the ground s t a r t e d           to    clear    I was    directed,          along w ith other

officers,          to    patrol     L ep pi ng s     Lane   to as si st       in the dispersal            of

supporters.



At 6 . 0 0      pm I went        to the S h e f f i e l d Traf fi c H e a d q u a r t e r s     to   re-j oi n my

serial         S er ge an t a nd the          rest   of the group.            We were       held there         on

s t a n d b y before        being       r el eased from duty at 7.0 0                pm.

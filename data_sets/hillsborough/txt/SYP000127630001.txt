             I live at the above address with my husband and son                                       ■;ho is 27

             live away,         I am the mother of Peter MCDONNEX-L who was born in

             Liverpool on the 9th February 1968.                        Peter was a single man who had

             been unemployed since June 1988.                  Prior to this he had qualified as a

             bricklayer at Old Swan and Riversdale Colleges in Liverpool.                                He had

             done some Youth Opportunity Schemes as a gardner but had found

             difficulty in finding wo rk.

             Peter had dons all his schooling in Liverpool,                         leaving school when he

             was sixteen years old.              It was then he went on to college avid gained

             hi s C ity and GuiIds in h r i cklaying.
                                                                        PAGE




                                                                       Peter

also had a scar on his left elbow.        His local doctor was Dr BECKETT

whose surg e ry is at i25 U 11et Road , LivarpaoI 17,

On the morning of Saturday 15th April I989 I got Peter up at about

730 am.    He then left the house at S am to meet, some friends on the

car park of a local pub where they were going to travel to Sheffield

in some private cars,,      One of the people he travelled with was called

               who is,ves in                   Li ver pool.   I don't know

which number he lives at and I don’t know any of his other friends

who he travelled w it h „

When Peter left home that morning he was wearing a green sweat shirt

which had mustard coloured sleeves.        It also had "BEST CO* written on

the chest in mustard with some other writing on it.           He was also

wearing blue jeans and white Adidas trainers which he had bought

three days earlier.      He did not wear jewellery or a watch but he

would have had a gold coloured Ronson cigarette lighter with him.

When Peter left that morning he also had his match ticket with him

but I don’t know which part of the ground it was for.

On Wednesday 26th April 1989       at 1510 hours 1 was shown by PCI          1

      of the West Midlands Police a green and mustard sweat shirt

with ’BEST + C O 5 written on the chest, a pair of jeans t brown socks,

pants and a pair of Adidas trainers,        I can identify all of these

items as being Peters and they are the clothes that I saw him leave

home in*    I was also shown a gold Ronson lighter and front door key

which I know were Peters and a packet of cigarettes which were the

brand Peter smoked.      There was also    13,48 in cash.     As far as I am
                                                                                 PAGE


           aware there is no property of Peters missing.      Peter did not wear

           glasses,,

           I was shown a box of matches with the "Mucky Duck* written on it.

           da   not recognise these as being Peters.

           Further to what I have said                 11iv es in               |and

           not as I previously said.

               October 1963 <19101963).    We had three children to the marriage,.

               They were all boys and. John McBRl'EN was the youngest..          John was born

               15th February 1971 <15021971).      He attended Holywell High School

               where he was studying for SA 9 levels..          He never had any illnesses

               apart from normal child illnesses.         The family Doctor Curley of

               Coleshill Street, Holywell,    had never seen him to treat him,

               John was a member of Liverpool Supporters Club and he obtained a

               ticket for the semi final football match between Liverpool and

               Nottingham Forest on Saturday 15th April           1989 (15041989),.   On that

               day John went out of this house near to 10.45am (1045) to catch the
                                                                                          PAGE


         bus from the Victoria Hotel in Holywell.                    When John left the house he

         was wearing a blue shirt,            blue jeans, white vest and underpants,           red

         scarf and grey sacks and a pair of black shoes.                    John went to the

         f o o t b all m a t,ch o n h is ow n ,

         The next time I saw John was when I identified John to the Police at

         4.30pm (1630) Sunday 16th April 198? C16041989) at the Sheffield

         M e d i ca 1 C e n t re .

         On Tuesday 25th April 1989 (25041989) at about 2.30pm (1430) I

         identified the clothing to DC I                        b.s that of my son’s John.       I

         also identified to DC                        one   black shoe (Item No.          )

         (E k hibit No.                ) as that shoe       as being worn by my son    when he

         left my house to go to the football                match.

         I authorise the Pol ice to keep the shoe until this enquiry is

         completed but I must stress I would like that shoe returned later.

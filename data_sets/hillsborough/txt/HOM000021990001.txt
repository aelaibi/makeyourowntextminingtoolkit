             Dear Sirs,

             We have been consulted by a number of people who received injuries
             at the Hillsborough Disaster on Saturday, 15th April, 1989 as well
             as the family of a party who died.

             We are anxious to obtain as much information as possible with
             regard to the Public Inquiry that it is proposed to hold under
             the chairmanship of Lord Justice Taylor as we anticipate attending
             at that Inquiry on behalf of our clients.

             Would you please be good enough to let us know to whom any
             correspondence or enquiry should be directed in connection with
             any information regarding the Inquiry.




             Yours faithfJlly,

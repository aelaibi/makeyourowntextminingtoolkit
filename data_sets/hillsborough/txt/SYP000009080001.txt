that      some      had been drink i n g and                         could see those a^T the               back       pushing

towards           the turnstiles,,                         It is    important        to    pgfTnt out that           both

C o nstable         GRUNN I L L and myself were                            riding     e x p e r i e n c e d Police     horses,,

I    mads my way with Con s t a b l e G R U N N I L L t h o u g h                            the    crowd and a t t e m p t e d

to ease           the     situation               by advising             thosjFwhts were          pushing to         ease    back.

1 could           see     persons               at    the     front       h e i M g squashed against           the stiles,

These        requests                 even      at    this       stage^ere          ignored.

For a short               time we a p p e a r e d                tq^have      the    s i t u a t i o n under    control,          but

at    this        time      both myself                    andi^onstabls        G R U N N I L L were    facing        the

turnstiles and unaware                                of    / i a t was    behind     us.

I sudde n l y felt a irtassiv/ push                                 from the        rear, causing        my horse to         be

pushed           forward,               I io o M ed         back and saw a massive                 crowd of f a n s.          To

me    they all a p p e a r e d A o                     be    shouting and           pushing     their way towards                 the

turnstiles,                  I shoi/ted a warning                     to move        back as those at the front

wer e being             c rushdfi,              but     they took no n o 1 1 c e .

C h i l d r e n and acynlts                     were        screaming       that    they were being crushed                  and    I

feared           for th^i r safety,,                        I saw    children being            passed over heads            to

s afety a w a y f t r o m the                    chaos.

At    this       point my horse            began to      panic     so   I msuggrtraut of the           crowd to

a void an accident,                  I saw young         p e o j ^ 0^ T e i.n g lifted    to the top of the

 barrier         between        the t e r ra c i na.ag^n^ns t i 1.e s and the West Stand turnstiles

 I continued to a p p e a l ^ r p e o p l e              to stop pushing          but all       requests

 seemed to be            i g ry/jrtTd,     The areas       outside      the   compound had become

 f ui i    and    p0 T £ q ns    in those areas a p p e a r e d to be           in a state         of a g i t a t i on

 I remember          seeing CVrns tabj^'^GRUNiNILL and a foot                     a j j / n c e r attempting       to

 c 1 o s e t h e b 3,u e p 8 r 1m ^ 0 r         gates.     Both gates               e v entually       closed,

A short          time    latajF’the re a p p e a r e d      to be |Pm a s s i v e    push from outside,

the       gates weyp? pushed over,                 and the      confined area        became a mass           of

hys ter i 0 T 1 , s c r e am i n g fa n s «

At this          point    I noticed a concertina                         to the     right     of the     terrace

turnstiJS s was             open and fans we ra^jETl owed thro u q h ,                    This a p p e a r e d    to

           great     relief as           some    fans moved away         from the        baci-^ and    relieved

the       pressure       on those         at the    front,

r.i also     remember a c o n c e rtina                     between tl~jj^^est S tand and the

terrace          lu/ns t il es o p e n aro-; o m e fans            entered    that way.          The

remainder          passed through the stiles                    in an orde r l y fashion,              A short

1 1 m e later- the              turnstiles were          c 1o s e d ,

1 remained           outside       the     ground at the ;....eppings Ln end and then

patrolled g e nerally until                      I was   stood down to N i a g r a at about              1820

                I am Constable              1696 of the M e r s e y s i d e Police Moun t e d Department.

                On S a t u r d a y    13th April          1989    (150489)          I was    one of a party of

                M erse y s i d e Police Officers                 giving     "Mutual         A i d 5 to the S o u t h Yorkshire

                 -----------------------------------                                                                                   N         {1°
                I was deployed in company with Co n s t a b l e                          1300 G R U N N I L L of the

                M e r s e y s i d e Pol'ice,     to the Leppings Lane                  end of the ground,,                   the end to

                be used by the Liverpool                    Supporters.

                r roiTi IciOO hrs          ( 1200)   to    1400 hrs        ( 1400)     i patrolled              uhe area          ot   tns

                turnstiles.            Although       there were          large       numbers of Liverpool                       supporters

                in the area,           they a p p e a r e d      reluctant          to enter         the ground,           and a p p e a r e d

                content        to wait       in the vicinity.               Many of them were                   drinking,          but     no
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S812A

problems were          being    caused,

About    1413 hrs       (1415),       the    crowd volume       began to          increase,      and

together with Con s t a b l e G R U N N I L L         I went    into       the a rea      i m m e d iately    in

front of the turnstiles                in an effort          to ease       the    crush.       At first,       our

efforts were          successful,       but very soon the             crowd       increase and so did

the    crush.     The    build-up was          very swift,          and despite          repeated      pleas,

the    crowd    refused to          listen and       continued       to    crush up agai n s t         the

turnstiles.           At this       time,    I had my horse facing                towards      the

turnstiles,       and s u d denly       I felt a massive             push from the            back,    causing

my horse to be pushed                forward.        There was a lot of shouting and the

m ood of the      crowd had become             very hostile.              I shouted w a r nings         to the

crowd that       people were          being    crushed against a wall                at the      front,       but

the warnings went             unheeded.        At    this    time    I heard someone            in the       crowd

shout    "LETS GET THIS B A S T A R D OFF HIS H O R S E . "                 I was    not aware         of the

person who       shouted,       but    could only assume             that    it was me to whom he

referred.        E3y now,      the    crowd had begun to             panic,       people were         shouting

and screaming,          and    I saw    children being          passed over          peoples         heads,    out

of the    crush.        At    this    point,    my horse       began to          panic    because of the

pressure against             him.     I have    never       known him to behave               like this       in a

crowd.      I moved him out of the                  crush as    I was       concerned         that    he might

kick    out and       injure    someone.

S h o r t l y after    this,    the e;cit gates         to the ground were                opened,      and

people were a l l o w e d       into    the ground,         a move which quickly                relieved       the

crush,    and which          in my opinion          prevented       people       from being      killed at

the turnstiles.

I have    been a M o u n t e d Police Officer               for E9 years,           and my horse         is 17

years    old,    having       been a police         horse    for     13 years.           He   is a very

competent       horse who       has    performed       duty at all          three Football            grounds

wi t h i n the Merse y s i d e       Police area,       as well as other             events      involving

large    crowds.        He has       never    shown any adverse             reaction to         crowds.        In
                                                                                              PAGE

              my years as a M o u n t e d Officer   I have   never    e x p e r ienced a crowd so

              hostile       in its attitude,   and so unwilling      to   listen to reason.

                                                                           M J ST'Af

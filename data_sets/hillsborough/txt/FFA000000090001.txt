  Dear

  I refer to your letter dated 24 March 1986, in which you make reference to
  difficulties with the West Ham United fixture on 12 March 1986.

  In dealing with the situation regarding the elevated standing area on
  Leppings Lane, I can only repeat my earlier comments that there was confusion
  regarding the use of this area on that occasion and the ground commander saw
  fit not to open it initially, but subsequently, on my instructions, did so.
  I can only add that it is not my intention to regularly close the elevated
  standing area and that, as agreed in the past, either I or John Freeman would
  discuss the position prior to a match and if there was such an intention then
  you would be informed accordingly.

  So far as the use of the television gantry is concerned, I would point out
  that whilst it may be alleged that police officers were uncoperative my
  information suggests that the television cameramen, and in particular the
  editor present, were most uncoperative and did not see the need for the
  presence of my officers at all.  I am sure you will agree that public safety
  is of greater importance than the media coverage and if we are jointly to
  achieve our objectives of ensuring the safety of the public at such splendid
  sporting events then the need for preventative measures, such as the
  attendance of my Scenes of Crime officers, is essential.  I know that you and
  I have discussed the-position and in fact one of the officers was removed
  from the gantry at our agreement but this did not satisfy the television
  cameramen.  Whilst I appreciate they have priorities, we too have priorities,
  and I hope that by mutual discussion such situations will not arise in the
  future.

 I am not aware                         of whether or not                             you will have T.V. coverage on Saturday for
 the match with                         Liverpool, but it                             is my intention - subject to your agreement -
 that my Scenes                         of Crime officers                             will be present once again because I feel
 their presence                         is essential if I                             am to deal adequately with instances which
 may arise.

  I trust this information will be of assistance to you.

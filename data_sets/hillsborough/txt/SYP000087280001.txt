            On Saturday                 15th A p r i l        1989    (1504 8 9 )         I attended          the F A C u p S e m i   F i nal

            to      be   played        between Liverpool                   FC & N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t        FC at the

            Hillsborough               gr o u n d ,     Sheffield.

            I bought           my       ticket          for   the    match      iron/ A n f i e l d     for £6, f o r the           Leppings

            Ln      standing         area.        I am a L i v e r p o o l supporter.

            I travelled              by    car    to       t he m a t c h,    with        three    friends,

                                    Huyton,

                                       Huyton & David               MATHER,          who    was    unfortunately           killed      in

            th e     tragedy         there.           He    l i v e d at                                       Huyton.

            We      only made          one     brief        stop    on our w a y           to S h e f f i e l d arid t ha t w a s      at a

            local        sweet       shop.        Whilst         travelling           there       we w e r e    subjected      to     very

            minor        traffic          del a y s ,      but   nothing        significant.

            We      arrived         in S h e f f i e l d      at a b o u t    11.30 am         (1130)      and     parked     the     car
                                                                                                                                    PAGE             2
                                                                                                                                    S3154

about      three         quarters           of a m i l e          from     the     ground.             I saw a f e w            odd

supporters              drinking          b e er   from        cans,       but     nothing           significant.

We    eventually arrived                     at    the       ground        entrance           at abp<it            12.30      pm    (1230)

having         received          no    police        direction             or     es clacJXaowr
                                                                                       ad^Qown               to    it or      seen any

violence,           disorder           or    drunkeness.

Outside         the      ground        it w a s      very         quiet and           I was         s e a r c h e d by the          police

before         going       in,      there      were       no      stewards         evident           at      that       stag e.

I had      no     difficulty              in f i n d i n g        which       turnstiles             to      use     or    entering         the

ground.           I enterd            the    ground          through a turnstile                       and        handed my         ticket

in.      I saw          no o t h e r      gates      open         or    being      opened and                saw     no    unauthorised

entry     to      the      g ro u n d .

Once     in the          ground        I saw       no     signs          directing            us w h e r e         to go a n d      went

straight          down        the     tunnel       onto        the       terracing.                Ih a d    no    troubles         using

the    tunnel           and    there        were     no      police        officers           or     stewards             controlling

that     part      of      the      ground.          Before            getting        onto     the          terracing         I saw        no

disorder          or     other        incident          and       I witnessed            no    consumption                 of a l c o h o l

in the         ground.

It o n l y      took a short                t i me yf'roro a r r i v i n g         at    the       ground          to     taking      up    our

position          on the         t e r ^ acjk^g.          I stood          there        with       the       three        friends      I had

travelled with and

I was     not      at      the      corresponding                 finture         last    year         and        I have      never

been     to     the      ground        before,          therefore             I was      not a w a r e            of a n y    other        way

onto     the      terracing            and     saw      no     signs       directing           us      elsewhere.

We    stood       on the         terracing           slightly            to     the     r ight       of      the     g o a l s as     you

looked         o n to    the     pitch       in P e n 3.               I h av e    marked          on the a t t a c h e d           sheet

where      I stood            virtually with                 the       others,        this     being          E

At    t ha t    time       the      terracing           was       almost        empty      andwe were               able       to     lie

down     and      sunbathe            and    read       our       programmes.

As    the a f t e r n o o n w e n t          on    the       terracing            got f u l l e r     but it w a s             about

1.30     pm      (1330)        before        we    had       to    stand        up.

              Slowly         the     cr o w d    got     bigger         and/tfe m a n a g e d         to       stay       in the         s am e      p l ac e

              together            up until        about          S.Sjirpm         (1455)       when       I realised                 t h at    the     crush

              was      greater         than      nor mal          id we w e r e          beginning             to    get        bunched         up     quite

              severely.

              I have         been      in    crowds         like       that       before       but    usually             the        presi      re e a s e s

              off      but    on t h i s        occasion          it d i d n ’t. / S y          this       '                         RATHER         ha d

              gone      slightly            in f r o n t     of me a n ^ / t o           my    right,                           he    g r i d as       a

              guide        I would          s a y at a b o u t         DbZ

              By     this     t ime       I'd m o v e d      sightly              towards       the       p o in t       by a b o u t         6 f oot        from

              by     first        position.

              The      players         were      out     on the         pitch       by now       but       they          ha d    not     kicked            off.

              Suddenly            there was           a steady          build       up of       pressure             from        behind,            t ha t

              t oo k    me    further           and    further          forward.              There       was       no    release             in the

              pressure            at 'all.        It got          to    such a stage             that          I c o u l d n ’t m o v e             anything

              except         my     feet,       it w a s     as    if      1 was        floating.

              By     this     t im e      people were             shouting         and        screaming             all     a r o u n d me.            The

              pain was            quite      intense         and       I was       having       dificulty                in b r e a t h i n g .            By

              this      time        the     people       in our         group       h a d a l l got            separated.                I had         no

              i de a w h e r e       David MATHER                h a d gone.            The    last       I sa w         of h i m he w a s             moving

              down      towards           the    front ,         but    I lost          sight    of       him and           became            too

              concerned w ith what                     was       happening          to m y s e l f        and what              was     happening

              a r o u n d me.

              By     now     I had been           pushed          up    next       to    the    last       crush          barrier             before         the

              fencing,            there w^s           one    to m y        left     I remember.                 On       the a t t a c h e d         plan

              this      is at_E7,

              I was        n ea r    to     it w h e n      it    broke.

              The      exact        events       of w h a t       happened          next       are    a    little           unclear            to me         now,

              but      somehow         I got      to     the      b a ck     of    the    terracing             and went              out      through

              th e     tunnel.            I got       out    into       the       forecourt          area and             tried         to     get     my

  were      given         resuscitation                 and    others          were    cleary       dead.          I did           not

■‘' W r e , g i v e n    resuscitation                  and    others          were    cleary       dead.          I did           not

  recognise             any      of    these         bodies and           could       not    describe          any    of       them.

  Whilst       standing               there      I began          to     think about          my    friends          who       may

  still       be    in t h e r e         so    I went         back       down    the    tunnel         an d onto          the

  terracing             at    the      back.          By     this      time     the    pen h a d       pretty

  well      cleared and                 I could         clearly          see    the    fron t.         There were              a

  number       of       people         there         up a g a i n s t     the    point,       st ill        standing

  but      quite        obviously             dead,        but a g a i n       I cannot       describe any                of

  them.

  I stood          there         in a d a z e         for a w h i l e          and    eventually            left     the

  ground and             phoned my             parents,           that     was       about    3.30       pm    (1530).

                                                                                                               and

             a n d we         realised           t h at      David MATHER             was    missing            We    made

  enquiries             to    find David and were                        eventually          taken       to    the B o y s

  Club and Police                     Station.

  E v e n t u a l l y we w e r e            taken       to    the      ground and after                quite       some        t im e        we

  were      told        t ha t    David        had      been      identified           by his a u n t          and    that          he w a s

  dea d.       We       returned            h ome     the     n e xt     n^rninq.           It w a s a f t e r       midnight

  before       we       found         out a b o u t        Dav;

  I   received           no      injuries            fr*mi the         incident        other       than       strained             stomach

  muscles,          but       I h a ve        ra'teived no m e d i c a l              treatment          for    that.              I did          not

  Looking          b ac k at          the     incident         and       the w a y     it w a s     handled          there         was        a

  distinct          lack         of    organisation,                nobody       seemed           to t ak e c o n t r o 1.          When           in

  the      c r u s h the         police        at     the     f r on t    were       shouting          at     us to m o v e         b a c k but

  t ha t    was     totally             impossible.               It a p p e a r e d    to       me that the          f an s t o ok

  the      lead     rather            than     the      p olice.

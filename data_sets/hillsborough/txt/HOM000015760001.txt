Dear Lord Justice Taylor

       Thank you for your letter to the Archbishop about his sermon at
the Hillsborough Memorial Service in Sheffield Cathedral.

       His Grace is away in Moscow at present and will not be back at
Bishopthorpe until late on July 27th - uncomfortably close to your
deadline. However, I am confident he will have no objection to your
using a quotation from the sermon at the head of one of the Chapters of
your Report.

                                    Yours sincerely




                                    Lay Assistant to the
                                    Archbishop of York

 The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor

              was    in the Liv er po ol            city Ce nt re         shopping         At about 3.30          pm I was          in

              a shop avid I heard one                 of the        shop a s s i s t a n t s    say that       there   had been

              trou bl e at H i l l s b o r u g h and that              some fans       had spilled onto            the ground

              an d   that     the game had been               post     poned.       I carried on shopping                but    then

              in a n o th er       shop     I heard    from a shop a s s i s t a n t            that    there    had been

              4.30    prn.      I also       developed        some     sharp s ta bbing             pains.     I tried to       ring

              home,    but there was            no    response         so   I went     home a nd        I

              arrived        home at about 5 . 1 5            pm.

              I was w it h my             parents    during     the evening we were                   listening    on the

of Gary.

tiy parents        left    home at a bout 9 pm to travel                      over    to Sheffield.           I

they    showed the scenes            of what          had h a p p e n e d at Hillsborough.

I saw    crowd scenes an d           I at       one stage        saw Gary.           I saw him     climbing

over    some barriers,         take a few steps                onto     the    pitch an d then

collapse.          The n som«ihfciy a p p e a r e d in front of him and then there were

happened.          I remember       saying,       "There's G a r y . 11         and being        con ce rn ed

over what         had h ap p e n e d to him.

I c o nt in ued to        listen to the          radio     but       it was    not until     my    parents

At   the time        I saw G ar y    clirnb over         the     fence      onto the      pitch he        climbed

over    on the      left    side of     the goal,          on my       right as       I looked at the TV

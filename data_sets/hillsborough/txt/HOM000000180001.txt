M a n ch es te r.          We were held up for about                    half an hour.              We got held up

a g a i n as we       came up to a set of                    islands    in Sheffield.               We got turned

back     by the Police.                I was going            the same way as              I had done        "ihe

previous year for the same                          game at that time and                  I knew where            I was

going to.

1 was sent           round a back way and                    came out onto another main road and

e ve nt u al l y got           into S h e f fi el d at about 2 . CO               pm (1400).         We    parked on-

a    road just            off the m a n            road about 10        minutes from Ine ground.                      we

Eventually           we    got, out      of the          car and. w a l k e d     towards      'the g r o u n d

Sheffield           there was a crush of                     people up to the turnstile ma rk ed -

turnstile           ter r a c e s .

T here were          two m o u nt ed office "s in the                   crowd who weren't               doing rr.ucn.

T hey were          snouting at           the      crowd but were           having        no effect.          I didn't

see any stewards at all.

The    crush of people at this                        point was such that                 I couldn't breath

 properly and             c o u l d n ’t move       either.        My brother was directly behind me

f ol l o w e d by my father.                 S te v e n was       crying.         One of the horses moved

a wa y and      created some space.                         One   lad then        pushed up against                the

 gate which           is the       exit for         the      West Stand, seating and his ma tejust

 lifted St ev en up and swung him                            onto my shoulders.

We     came   up to the            turnstiles at about                 seven minutes            to three and went
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S35G

through.        I had to get St ev en off my shoulder                        to go through.                I

s ho w e d my ticket.        One     portion was            torn off and        I was handed back

the stub.

Just    before we got          to the t urnstiles              I noticed a number              of fans

climbing up the wall              onto    the    roof of the turnstiles and onto a porta

cabin roof.

We got      through the turnstiles and                     I saw about fifty           police       officers

inside.       They ware        searching        some       fans as     they came       in.       Same were

telling       the onas who had           c...ivnbed over         to get      back.     Ail     t h a t .i saw

come over snouted            "We *ve got tickets,"

I spoke       to one of the ,-olicemen and said ''Can you try and gat

something       dona    outside.         It's    bad out the r e r              a    said     " i can * C mova

from here until            I gat my orders,                 I have to stay here..                i said        ‘Cant

you    radio?'*      He said       "No   I haven't           gat o n e .’’

After    that     I nought a programme and went                      to the t-^lets.

As    I was    talking      to the officar                I saw some    concertina gates              open

leading       into   the area marked A--G on the S he ffield W ednesday 'r C

H i l l s b o r o u g h Gr ou nd map.

t »nv not     sure who      opened       it ;vut there was stewards and police                            there.

About    -150 fans      came      through.           I saw some of therr. showing                their

tickets       as they      came    in.     The m o u nt ed       policemen blocked the gate and

about 50       policemen wal ke d through                   in pairs.        Wher they were               in they

closed the        gates again.           This w ou ld be almost               five to        in r e e «

I went      there    last year       but    I was          in the stands.           I d i d n ’t know where

to go and there were               no signs          to    inform me.        1 saw tna tunnel               and we

went    through      it.     There were a few hundred others                         in there.             I wanted

to turn       round and go back but                  I couldn't      because        of the      crowds.         I

said to my father            " W e ’ll go through and try to move off to the sides.

Thera were        not any stewards              or    police at either          end of the           tunnel.

Towards       the end of       the tunnel w h i c h was             dark,     it started to slope
                                                                                                        P AG E       4
                                                                                                        S350

downwards.        I saw that the           players of both teams were                     coming out onto

the     pitch and starting             to kick around.

In the tunnel           everyone       was happy an d as we emerged they were

singing.        I saw no-one drinking at all                    or any fighting.

I took a step           into    pen 3 but my dad         called me back and said to go

i nto    pen 4.     We we re go i ng to go to the side but when                           I looked across

I saw a barrier           barring any body from going                    to the sides.           Instead we

made     our way towards          the front      of     pen four and got            to a position,             :;y

the     fence and got          just    to the    right       of •t f.icg a t e .   At tills time uiiey

were     still w ar mi ng up on the            pitch.

I had got to a viewing                position which           I have marked on a grid olan as

faeinq ir. square L S .           We got      into this        position ana a f t 2 r about             10 to

15 seconds        there was a surge            in the     crowd.          I got thrown to the             right

an d my father was             thrown to the         left.     .The      pressure     m    the    erawo was

such that       I c o u l d n ’t move and my arms were                   pinned to my c n e s t .         My

feet were off the floor                 completely.

The     pressure was        still     increasing and I must                have been somewhere              near

Stevsn.         1 was    shouting       to a Police man to get us out of t h e r e .                        I

was s cared as          X d o n ’t know what my brother was                    feeling at        that   time.

1 saw the ball           on the       pitch    come towards          us and then GROSSSi_AAR              came

near and was        looking       into the       pen.     He started walking and                  i saw nxm

speak     to one    p ol ic em an who just shrugged his snouiders and turned away.

I st ar te d to shout a gain at the                  policeman         in front of me.            whilst        X

was     s houting   1" saw a policewoman open the gate                         onto the     pitch and           I

saw S te v en helped out.               I saw my father            get    out just after along with

what     I thought was about 20 or 30 others.

The     force    of the     crowd was         taking me towards             tne gate.       I had by now

got my feet on the floor.                     This   brought me up against                the gate       just

as   it was      closed by a pci iceman.                I have marked the spat where                           I

■finished up on the grid plan as                      X2 in square LS.

I was    near to this gate             for about a minute and for a few seconds a:-,

the gate was open the              pressure eased.              As      it was shut again the

pressure        became   intense again.               The    policewoman opened the gate again

an d she was shouting at                the policeman who had shut                     it.        Some   lads        in

•front of ms got out and                I Want    towards        it .     I started to get c .-.t ana

knew that        it had broken.           I was able          to get out anu               X pulled h i r*i out

right after rne.              I stsoped     there      then and together with the

policew oman who was             blonde anc. about 2i> years                   cf a g e , I puiied a :ot

more    out     in a few seconds and             passed the;?, on to a waiting St Johns

A mb ulance man.          I did this until             another        policeman        came.

My dad came walking              over and     .sok me back to Steven who was                             crymc.

He was        being a tt en de d   by a St John Amb ul an ca man and was                           eventually

taken to the far              anc. of the    pitch to a First Aid                    point.        1 was

walking a few yards              behind and       X kept        glancing           back.     As    I was

w a l ki ng    down    1 could see that          the fences           frosr. :ha pens onto               the       oitch

were    bulcung.         1 saw a policeman             run onto         the    pitch and up to the

referee.

I was     still       going    to the    ’First A i d ’ post whi c-i is under                      the North

S t a nd and had to get past about 20                        police     dogs to get to             it.     They

didn't        seern too friendly.

I got     into     the   'first A i d ’ and a sked St ev en hew he was.                            He said he

was alr ight          now so    I told them that              I would take him away with ;r.c-> t h e n .

We went        back out       to the    pitch and as we entered between the S pion                                   a   op

                                                                                                   S35G

a nd the N o rt h S t a n d       I saw two very young St John Ambulance                    boys

s tr ug g li ng with a stretcher                with a big man      lying on it.

I said to Ste ve n           "Dad's up the         corner up by pen 7.         Go and stay w ith

him."

I said to one of the                St John youths "Give me this end and

y ou go to the front" and together we took him to the First                              Aid       post.

W he n we got        there    I roiled'him off onto a blanket.                    I told the two

kids      to stop tnsre          because    they    looked frightened.         They were white.

I then ran out wi tn the stretcher and about                         half way Lack       I was

joinsd       ay    someone    else.       I thin!:; it was a oo 1 1 c e m a n .

we qot down to where               t-".a crush was and we were signal lea to a boy

about      12 years      c-ia.     We    put him on the stretcher and with the

po 1 x ceman       in f r or.t we took him towards            the    "First Aid. '

By now there was a line of                  policemen across         the   r.itcn and when wa oot

to there          they would n' t       part.     The    policeman at the front        of the

st retcher         had to shoulder         his way through          them to get     past.

We    took    the    lad to the First Aid where we                  put him onto a blanket as

well.

I then ran back           to the        pens and the       policeman stayed with the lad,

W he n    I got back a St           John Amb ul an ce man took         the stretcher         off me and

went      off w ith another         officer.

I stood a ro und for a few seconds and another Liverpool                             fan said       "Get

some      hoarding."         We then pulled some            hoarding away and we went

bac kw ar ds and forwards               between    the    pens ana the      ’First Aid"      post

a bout 3 or 4 times.

W hi le    I was     doing this         I was aware       of a tannoy a nn ou ncement        saying       "

Get      off the     pitch."

A ft er    the trips      to the        ’First A i d 9 post    I went      back to the      pens and

 looking      into     pen 3 I could see that the              crush had gone        but there were

still      some     inside who needed some help.                 I got down into       it and as
                                                                                                              PAGE         7

soon as I did I r ea lised that                  there were a lot of lads between 20 and

3 0 y ears     of       in groups      of 3 an d 4.       They were obviously dead.

When      I saw      it I think        I screamed an d        I know     I started crying.                    I just

got    back out onto             the   pitch and w a l k e d towards the          corner where my

dad was.

As    I was    passing           pen 4 someone       shouted for anyone          to       "get hold of

h e r .11    I went over an d            reached up.         1 took hold her          2   nd put ner over

my s h o u l d e r .      I thought       sne was -about 22 years ou..

I lay her down on the                  pitcn and 'Cried to give her ’Che                   'kiss of

life."        I tried to bang             her on the         ribs   but as    « cici a U          tine re was

was    softness.           She     hadn't     got any    ribs.      While     there       I nsw          she was

dead.

A man       came        up and said hi was her           father.         I just got up arc. le-i-'t rum

there.        I was very u p s e t .           I went    to my dad and found him.                        I said

'‘Come on,          we are g o i n g . "

G oi ng     back        to the girl wniie        I was       there a fireman       earns up and spoke,

to me •       He was obv io us ly as upset as                  I was ana sa.i&            Whau     tne t uux, i tig

hell's       qoing on h e r e .            1 later    found out that          the girl was               only

 19 years          old and her name was                              •    i     qui         sure -,»ne was

the kiss           of    life.

W hen       I got       to my dad and said           "Come    on we are going*' 3.          'Co   o k    Roxa o*

 his arm to pull               him out.       Just    then a tall        policeman about 7 feet

 tall       said    "Come on give          us a hand."         We then broke some more hoarding

 a nd went         back    to the      pens   into the       centre of the goals and                    put    it on

 the    pitch.           The    policeman     rolled a m an of about 40 onto                  the        aoard.        ria

 was    o bv i ou s ly aead.           I then tried to          pick him up but           I c o u l d n ’t.          Fly

 right hand was                hurting    too much.       Some on e else      came and tooi-i over.

 I just went             back over       to the girl      then and stayed         Chere.                I said    uo

 her      father        "I'm s o r ry mate,      I just      couldn't     do nothing."

I then w al k e d back         towards dad an d bumped                  into someone.                I felt a

pain       in my hand.       I reached my dad an d                   we left the ground.

We went       into a hairdressers             once we got outside and                         I phoned home to

tell   the family we were all                 okay.

A p o li ce man saw me holding my hand and                          told me            where the hospital

was.        I said    " I ’m not going        there        they are         too busy."

We want back          to the     car and my dad drove                us back home.                  As we got off

the m o t o r w a y we       went     to Broad G r ee n hospital                for    treatment. I             was    i:

ray'd and          I was     told that        X had two fractured fingers                          on my V r'
                                                                                                           1.“1i

As to the handling             of the s it uation             1 think         that the younger

policem en were            pitching    in put        the    older      ones were         standing           bacn: tor

quite a long time.               1 d i d n ’t see any          of them pitch             in at all.

There was a total             lack of o rg an i s a t i o n         in and around                  the ground and 1

feel       there was a lack of            co-or di na ti on         between             the emergency services

e s p ec ia ll y with       regards    to c om mu ni ca ti on within the                      police       tnemse i v e s .

I feel       that we should have             been given the             larger end             of the ground as

we have       ter, thousand more supporters.                      It    was practically               uhe      same as

the    previous y e a r .

Overall        it struck me         that there were            too many         policemen doing                nothing

just       standing a ro u n d

Like       1 say    I went    last year        but    I don't       think there was any

d ifference         in the way       it was      policed.         "It was as oad               last year as

this       in my opinion.

I also       think    that    the gates        should have          been opened earlier and the
                                                                                  PAGE

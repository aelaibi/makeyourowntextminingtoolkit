HILLSBOROUGH

Stephen Wooler in the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers has spoken to me about
your interest in the recent representations concerning the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, I requested from the South Yorkshire Police a full report on the matters
which were raised in the television programme before Christmas. I have now
received that report, and I am enclosing copies of all the material which the Chief
Constable has sent to me. Stephen Wooler asked me to send you a copy directly.

I have suggested to Stephen Wooler that we should aim to meet to discuss the next
steps in handling this material at the beginning of March. I assume that you will wish
to attend that discussion. If you agree, I will ask my secretary to arrange a provisional
date.

                              Response to Daily Mirror report on Hilisburoug l

      Respdriding to a report injtoday’s Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug l tragedy, Assistant
     .Chief Constable lan Dairies said:

   “Reports about this particular video tape continue to add confu sion to an already
   complex- set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that, any new
 :evidence surrounding thejdisaster will be examined in detail. There s no new evidence
 ■ hvftte, article published, irr'lhe Daily Mirtui today.

              in;t|u<&Uori - from a closed circuit television camera s owing iiie disaster
  Pinfold on -the' teppinQs Lane terraces - Has never been ‘missing and it was made
   available in •fuii to bptb Ljord Justice Taylor’s inquiry and to the c< roner's inquest. Its
 . exlstunce has nover boerj in doubt

     •-1wjeana^_^CT:tbok tis pictures was indeed in working order, ot icrwise there would
     ,ha^; bWi-.ho tape td sub>nit as evidence.

 ’ “What bfficers-h&ve previfcusly'explained is that the live transmissior of the pictures into
   the-'poHce eontrolrpoint atjthft lirtte was of poor quality This meant lat they had to rely
  , o n.ite vlew frpm the.poiicje oontrol toom window and on information From officers on the
    ground,. It h;as afways been assumed that the Interference on their screen was caused
  .by teileVisiqn?equipiTrent peing used to transmit live coverage of th< FA cup semi-final,
 " .wfiftfytwas•noijBsfacfor'^isii the equipment was tested earlier in the jay.

     '■‘AsJiss.-baen explained before, the confusion over ‘missing’ tapes eems to arise from
      ■the-.fact that .fwo other tapes recorded at the ground on the day c the disaster were
     ••^©Iwtlbvemight frofri$h$ffield Wednesday Football Club’s recorditg suite in a locked
      Tbom.'rin'thiS;stadium:. Of)e would have shown a disused area of tl <   e complex and the
       other, would- have’ shown turnstiles. Neither tap© would have b    ' i en relevant to the
       ■tragedy and th© mbtiv©,fb|- the theft has never been established.

      KW© understand that en qjj;iries are being conducted by the Crown prosecution Service

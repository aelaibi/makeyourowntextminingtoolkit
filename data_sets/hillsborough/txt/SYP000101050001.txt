             I am a Police                 Constable              in the    South Yorkshire               Police,        presently

             s t a t i o n e d at R o t h e r h a m .

             A t 9 . 0 0 a.m.          on S a t u r d a y ,         15th Apri,        1989,       I was        on w e e k l y    leave       duty

             but     du e    to     th e     football          match       duties     with     the    Liverpool           v Nottingham

            Police          Station.

            On arrival              at M a i n      Street,          I along      with      several        other       officers,            was

             conveyed          by    coach        to    t he      Hillsborough         football           ground,        arriving           there

            for a bri ef in g                in th e     Hillsborough              ground     for     around         1 0 . 0 0 a.m.          The

            briefing          took         place       and     I was       directly        under     the       command     of        Inspector

            Ellis         on S e c t o r      14.       I was       on     serial     37    under     th e      serial     Sergeant,

            Sergeant          Kennedy           from     *C2*.           The    duties      for    that        day were         to    attend

            at     the W a d s l e y         railway         station and          to a w a i t     th e    arrival        of     the    train

            that       was    carrying           Liverpool           supporters.

            My     duties,          along       with     other       officers,         was    to     search        the    supporters              at

            r a n d o m as        they      le ft      the     railway         station,~ prior            to    them     being        escorted

            to     th e     ground         by S e r g e a n t      1829 F ra n ce      and    his     officers,           who        were    also

            present          with     us a n d w h o s e           duties      were    to    escort        t he    supporters           to    the

            Hillsborough              ground.            Police          Sergeant      France        was       officer     in        charge       of

            serial        36.       On a rr iv a l           of    the    train,      which       consisted only               o f th e O N E
train and which                   I understo od was                       to       have    on     board 550          supporters,

came     as       a surprise            as       only        one       train a rr iv ed           and       in t o t a l       I would

estimate           about        200     supporters                 in al l         were     on boar d.

These        supporters            appeared               to      be     in g o o d       humour       and     very       friendly,-

none     appeared           to     have          been drinking                  and       they     consisted             of    'family*

type     supporters.

Prior        to    th e    arrival            of      th e     train         several        hundreds           of    supporters,             al:

of w h o m        I believe            to     be L i v e r p o o l           supporters,            were       making          their     way

along        Halifax Road,                  past        the       railway          station and              down     towards          t he

football           ground.             Many        of     these         supporters              were       seen     to    be    carrying

not    only        six-packs            of       beer        and       lager,        but    12 p a c k s       EACH.           They were

also     seen       drinking            beer/lager                 from        large       tw o   litre        plastic          bottles

and    they appeared                   to     be      in a j o v i a l ,           h a p p y mood,          some     being          rather

boisterous.                My attention                   was      drawn       to a        group       of    six     to       eight    male

supporters            across           t he      opposite              side    from        t he   Wadsley           railway

station.            One     of     these           youths          aged about              16 to       17 y e a r s ,         was    totally

drunk        and    I,     in    company with Police                           Constable            1429 B as hf o rt h,              crossec

the    road and            spoke        to       the      unknown            youth.         He w a s        very     unsteady and

worse        the w e a r        fo r    drink.               He    was       sitting        on a s m a l l          wall       and

appeared           unable        to     stand           unaided.              Police        Constable              Bashforth          spoke

to    th e    older        member           of     th e      group and             told     him    that        the       younger       man

would        not    be     let     in t h e           ground           in t h a t     state.           The     older       m a n wa s

reasonable           and        understanding                     and    said       he     would arrange                 someone       to

stay wih           t he    younger            man.          They        then       continued           on    their        w a y,

assisting           th e y o u n g          man along.                  He    was     not a r r e s t e d ,         firstly          because

his    friends            were    helping               him along             and    secondly,              du e    to    the       amount

of    passing         supporters                 in     comparison             to    Police        presence,              to    do    so m a y

have    resulted            in P o l i c e            injuries.

The    day        itself        was     very          hot    and        I was       approached              many     times          whilst     ii
                                                                               *                   . . .


the    location            of    the     Wadsley              railway          bridge/station,                     asking       which

                                                                                                                      R36l


public       houses          were        open.              Although         public        houses          were       in    t hat
                                              *

immediate          area,          many        had       their      doors        an d      windows          boarded          up.        I was

unable       to    assist           in    these             enquiries,          firstly           because            I do not          know     the

area      and     secondly,              it       appeared         t ha t      they       had     drunk         enough       alcohol

without         going        in     search             of    anymore.

I would         estimate            that          we    had    been       at    the       railway          station          for     three

h o urs     when       the     train          arrived.             As     previously              stated,            these       supporters

w er e    good     natured           and well                behaved         and     made       their          way    under       Police

escort       to    the       ground.               The       serial       I formed           part         of    also       escorted        the

supporters             f rom      the     train             down   to     the       football          grounds,             arriving        on

the      front     of    Leppings                 Lane.

I    would      estimate            t hat         the       time   was       j ust     gone       2.00         p.m.       that    day     and

Leppings          Lane       was    very           busy       with      supporters              on    foot.           I was       under       the

impression             that       very        few       supporters             made       any     positive            attempt          to e n t e r

the      ground        and     several            unknown          (to me)           senior          officers             (i.e.     Inspector

level)       came       to     me    and          other       officers          shouting             for       us    to    get    the

supporters             into       the     ground.              In o u r        small      group           of    officers          it    was

almost       impossible              to       get       the    crowd         to m o v e      to      the       turnstiles.              The

crowd would             not       form      any         orderly         queues         and      pushed          constantly             against

each      other .        Several              supporters             went       up     onto       the      grass          banking       owned

by    the    tyre       fitting           company             directly          opposite             to    the       Leppings          Lane

entrance.              Officers           were          unable       to      get     these        supporters               back     onto      the

roadway.           T his       group       of          probably         40     to    50    supporters                were    drinking

heavily,          supping           from          large       plastic          two     litre         cannisters             and     tin    cans

of b e e r    and       lager       etc.

I,    along       with       what        appeared             only      a few        Police          Officers,             made     hopeless

attempts          to    get       the     supporters               into        the    ground.              It w as,         as    I at     the
                                                                                                               PAGE 4

time       described,              'L I K E ‘-STIRRING P O R R I D G E ' .                Everyone             went       wherever          they

pleased.              Many       supporters           would       approach             and     ask       me    how    to    get       into       a

certain          area within              the    ground          but    unfortunately,                    I know          nowhere

either          inside        or      outside        the    ground.              The    coloured              tickets       did       not

help       as    I was        unable       to    see       the    colour          coded        boards          on    the    turnstile

entranceways.                    I feel        that    they       should          have       been        situated          well       above

he a d     height,          so     that    supporters             to    the       rear       of     the       crowds       could       have

seen       the       correct        queue       that       they    were          required           to    get       into.        What       was

in    fact       happening,             was     that       supporters             were       choosing           what       they       thought

was      a queue.

At    around          2.45       p.m.     the    crowding          became          intense           and       shoulder          to

shoulder             pushing        and    heaving          was    taking          pla c e .         Still,          no    one    appeared

to k n o w       where       t h ey     were     heading.              I saw       at     this       stage          supporters          with

young         children           aged     approximately                10    years        old,       now       walking          away    from

the      crowds        and       one    man     commented          to me          t hat      it was           'BLOODY       DISGUSTING'

and      he     said    that        the    organisation                was       pathetic.               The    crowding          was       very

tight         an d    it wa s      becoming           difficult             to    raise        my    arms       from       my    sides.

To    be      closely        compact           was    becoming          clostrophobic                    and    because          we    were

so clos e ,           the    smell        of    stale       'ale'       on       the    breath           of    the    supporters             was

str o n g .          I had       with     me    my    personal          radio          but     it    was       difficult          to    h ear

transmissions'.

Ar    around          2.50       p.m.     I heard          a voice          almost        pleading             with       the    control

to have          'the       g a te'     opened.           By n o w      supporters                were        climbing          over    the

entrance             wall    and       I saw     an    officer          trying          to p r e v e n t        this       happening.

The      Mounted        Officers           at    t hi s     location             were     so      tightly           packed       that       they

were       virtually             useless,        not       being       able       to move.               (Inpsector             Ellis       on

                                              4i,
over      the      radio         for     all         available              officers          to e n t e r       the     gro u n d .       I

assumed         that       a pitch            invasion                had    occurred           and      I,    with      other       officers

from      serials           36     and    37,            attempted           to e n t e r       the      ground         by    the    left

entrance           concertina             gates.                I was        the     last       Police         Officer         to    enter       the

ground         in c o m p a n y        with          Police           Constable           1266       Adshead.            I began        to

follow         the    other          officers               when       I heard          a call          from    behind         me.      It was

the      gateman          at     the     location               and     he    was       unable          to    c l ose    the    g ate      after

us du e        to the          crowd      pushing               the     gates        open.           I returned              with    Police

Constable            Adshead           and      forcibly               pushed        outside            the    ground         the    invading

supporters            and        by b r u t e            strength,           pulled          the     concertina              gates

together.             In       fact,      the            gateman        was       unable        to      efficiently            carry       out

his      duties       and        did     not        appear         to be          physically             strong         enough,        without

regard         to m e n t a l l y        strong             enough,          to     say      'NO'     to      the    supporters            who

w er e    trying          to e n t e r        by     force.             I,    with        Police        Constable             Adshead,          then

made      an    attempt           to     catch            up    with         serial       3 6 /37       but due         to the       crowd

inside         the        ground,         got            o n l y as    far     as    the      rear       of the      side

terraces/seating                     area       (left           side).            One     man      with       his   young       boy

shouted         to        us     to g e t           in     the g r o u n d     and       help      out.        He     wasvery        annoyed

as    well      as        emotional,                 but       I did    not       repl y .         We    could        not get        any

further         into       the       ground          and        eventually,               Police        Constable             Adshead

and      myself       returned            outside               the     ground          to    the     front,        right       s ide      of

Leppings           Lane.          (Our       backs             were    near        to     the      bridge       and      river).           I

was      still       not       aware      of        what        ha d    actually             taken      place       and m a n y        people

emerging           from        the     ground,             being       male        and       female          alike.          They
were        crying and           a n n o y e d as w e l l         as      bitter        towards         the     Police.

Frustration            was       shown       by the         supporters            and a bitterness                    toward;

Police.          Several           of     these       supporters           were         coughing          and     choking            ■=

very     u ps e t .        Some      came      ou t    without          shoes          on t h e i r     feet      and      some

no     shirts       on.        I heard a            radio      request           for      several         ambulances             to

a t t e n d at      t he L e p p i n g s       Lane      end      of    the     ground and             for      the     attends

of    the F i r e      Service           with       cutting        equipment.                 My    impression when                   t

Fire     Service           were      called upon was                   that     due      to    t he     compactness              of       '

crowd       people         had     started        to     dehydrate,             although            I was       unable          to

understand            as     to w h y      cutting          equipment           was       required.

Many     supporters              who     got    out     of     the      ground          said       it w a s     terrifying

inside and            that       several        had      been      injured.              The       fleet      of a m b u l a n c e s

arrived almost                at    the      same      time       as    did     the      fire       tenders.           A senior

fire    officer            a p p r o a c h e d me      to    establish           what         was     happening            and where

did    the P o l i c e        require          them     to a t t e n d .          I was        unable         to a s s i s t         and

directed         him       to a n      Inspector            standing          nearby.              This    confusion went

on    for    some      time        until       I made        my way        down        t he    right       side       of    the       grour

to    the    gates         where       the     injured were               taken        from.          I was      then       shocked

to    see a n d       count        10 b o d i e s      l y in g    on     the    ground,            some      tendered           to       by

Police       Officers          and      others         overseen           by St.         John's        first      aiders.                 No

screens       were      at     this       time a r o u n d         th e    bodies,            and     it w a s    obvious             that

they were         in f a c t        dead.        I r ec a l l          speaking          to P o l i c e       Constable              Lipski

and    saying       that       I had         counted         10 d e a d at         the        top    side      and     he       said

that    it w as        rumoured           that      about         60 were        feared         d e a d at       this       time.              I

stayed       near      to    the       10 d e a d     bodies,           forming         a     human       chain      to     protect

the    bodies       from       the      supporters            leaving           th e     ground.           Several          male

supporters          were       distraught             and     began        visibly            fighting         with        their

friends       on s e e i n g        the      bodies      and       they     totally            lost       control          of

themselves.            Their         colleagues             held        onto     them         and    in f a c t      received

punches      and      kicks         from     their       own mates.                I heard           the      comment           from       one

Other         comments             were,       'YOUR'VE KILLED                      'EM Y O U B A S T A R D S . '             I was         kicked

pushing          crowds            who       insisted           in       leaving         by the      only       gate        available             for

tried         to m o v e         them        on.        We    tried         to    be     diplomatic            and    caring              when

moving         the         crowd        on    but       they        had     become        hostile         towards           us.           However,

TWO     supporters                 were       excellent,                 one     was     aged about            55 years           and       he

appealed            to      th e    crowd          to    leave           quickly         to a l l o w     the    emergency

services            access.              Another             young        man aged about                25 years,            was          also

excellent             and appe aled                 to       th e    crowd        in a       similar       manner.               This       young

man was         attacked                by a n o t h e r       man and            I intervened             to    stop        t he

attacker.                  In fa ct,          the       crowds w e r e           now     taking      more       notice           of       the    tw o

supporters                than      th e      Police          a n d as         s u ch,    we    left      it    to    them        to a p p e a l

to     the     crowd.              I later          spoke           to    the     younger        man and         thanked              him       for

hi s    assistance                 although             he    had        received         abuse      and       violence           towards

him.          I did         not     obtain          his       personal            details        but      believe           he a s s i s t e d

well      in m o v i n g           on    the       crowd.            It w a s      in fact,          on    speaking              to       this

young         man     that         I was       fo r      the        first        time     made      aware       of w h a t        had       gone

As     th e    crowd d is pe rs ed more                        thinly we,retu rn ed                     outside           th e    gate          used

b y the        emergency                services             and     I saw Police              Transit          vans        being          used       to

convey         th e       dead      bodies          from       outside            the     ground.

Whilst         at     this         location,             after           some     unknown amount                of    time        had

             passed,        Police       Sergeant          Kennedy         came       to m e a n d     I,    with      other

             officers,         made      my way       to       the     Wadsley        railway       station       on    foot       (as    per

             pl an ) .      The    moving       of    traffic           on H a l i f a x     Road had almost             come       to a

             standstill           and    supporters             on     foot made        their       way     up t he     road away

             from     the    ground.           Many       of    th e    supporters           were    dishevelled             and    clearly

             shaken,        as w e r e     many Police               Officers.

             Several        supporters          asked where              th e    nearest          telephones         were     and    due    to

             no t    being     local,       I was         unable       to a s s i s t .      I feel       that   a     stunned

             silence        had    co me    over      t he m a j o r i t y       of    the    supporters         who    made        their

             way     home.        I, w i t h    my    serial,           later     returned          to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane       prior

             to     returning       to     *C1*      by    coach and            going      of f   du ty.

             29 January 1997




             Thank you for your letter of 14 January 1997 enclosing a letter you have
             received from Mr P Hammond, Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support
             Group, of 21 Rosemount Road, Liverpool LI7 6BX. You invited my comments.

             I have the deepest sympathy for the families involved in the tragic events which
             took place at Hillsborough and fully understand the concerns raised by the
             recent programme. The Horde Secretary, when he spoke in the adjournment
             debate on this topic on 17 December made the point that any decisions which
             have to be taken must be on the basis of consideration of all the relevant facts
             and underlying evidence, rather than simply on the basis of the television
             programme itself. He said that in particular the Home Office would consider
             whether there is any new evidence, and if so. whether that evidence is of such
             significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner,
             either the outcome of the Taylor enquiry or the verdict of the juiy would have
             been different.

             My main role in the events which have followed the Hillsborough disaster has
             arisen from my responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. I
             have previously considered several applications made by relatives of the
             deceased for consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an
             order directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case I concluded that
             the matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect
             of the High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have
             been canvassed by the relatives in unsuccessful judicial review proceedings.

             There does not appear to be anything in the programme which touches on the
             issues raised in the applications which I have already considered. My officials
             are. however, in touch with the Home Office so that I may be infomied of any

                new evidence which may emerge and is relevant to my responsibilities under
                Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. I shall have close regard to any material
                which may put to me as to the desirability of any further inquest, In addition,
                If relatives or others were to maJke an application based on further evidence -
                they have not yet done so - this would be considered carefully in the usual
                way.

                I have a further interest in this matter because of my statutory duty to
                superintend the work of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I understand that
                the Director has also asked to be kept informed of the enquiries being made
                by the Home Office so that she may consider, in the light thereof, whether any
                further action may be required on her part. You will recall that the issue of
                criminal liability was very fully considered at an early stage on the basis of the
                evidence disclosed by the Taylor Report and the investigation undertaken by
                the West Midlands police.

                You wrote in similar terms to the Director of Public Prosecutions and she asks
                that you treat this also as a response to that letter.

Dear Mr and Mrs Clark

The Attorney General has asked me to thank you for your letter of 9 January
and to reply. He has the deepest sympathy for yourself and all the families
involved in the tragic events which took place at Hillsborough and fully
understands the concerns raised by the recent programme. Your letter
suggested re-examination of the circumstances although you did not indicate
whether you had in mind a further public inquiry or the seeking of an order for
a fresh inquest.

In considering the question insofar as the inquest is concerned the Attorney
General has in mind the points made in the House of Commons in a debate on
this topic on 17 December and what the Home Secretary said in response. He
made the point that any decisions which have to be taken must be on the
basis of consideration of all the relevant facts and underlying evidence rather
than simply on the basis of the television programme itself. He said that in
particular the Home Office would consider whether there is any new evidence,
and if so. whether that evidence is of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the Coroner, either the outcome of the Taylor
Enquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The main role of the Attorney General in the events which have followed the
Hillsborough disaster has arisen from his responsibilities under Section 13 of
the Coroners Act 1988. He has previously considered several applications for
consent to the making of an application to the High Court for an order
directing the holding of a fresh inquest. In each case he concluded that the
matters put forward did not establish that there was a realistic prospect of the
High Court granting such an order. Indeed, very similar issues have been
canvassed in unsuccessful judicial review applications.

There does not appear to be anything in the programme which materially
affects the applications which the Attorney General has already considered.
Officials here are however in touch with the Home Office to ensure that the
Attorney General is informed of any new evidence which may emerge and is
relevant to his responsibilities under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988.

At present, and while the Attorney awaits the views of the Home Secretary,
there Is nothing that can be added to what has already been said by him in the
House. The Attorney will have close regard to any points the Home Office may
put to him as to the desirability of any further inquest. In addition, any
application based upon further evidence would be considered carefully in the
usual way but as I have indicated, the programme is not of itself evidence.

Yours sincerely

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER




Thank you for your letter of 14th January, 1997, enclosing a letter you have received from

Mr.Philip Hammond, secretary to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.




I shall deal specifically with the point at (i) which is addressed to me. I am not aware of a

complaint being received by the Crown Prosecution Service from the Support Group,

although a number of individuals have recently written. However, I have treated the letter

you enclosed as a formal complaint.




I understand that following the recent television programme; "Hillsborough" the Home Office

have raised a number of questions with the Chief Constable. When they have the answers to

these questions, I intend to consider them so that I can then decide what further action, if

any, I should take.



You will appreciate that the programme itself is not evidence; the question is whether it made

any assertions not previously considered and if so, what evidence there is to support those

assertions.
I appreciate the programme must have raised a number of anxieties for the families involved

and caused them no little distress in re-living this tragedy. I have the utmost sympathy for

their suffering and I can assure you that if as a result of the Home Office questions I receive

information which needs further investigation, I shall not hesitate to ask for that to be done

    How are you!

    I have recently had a request from Paul Jennings in Central Casework at York relating to the
    Hillsborough Inquiry.

    The enquiry centres on letters received from representatives of bereaved families in Merseyside,
    addressed to the Director in London, asking her to re-open the inquests in this case.

    The trigger for the letters was evidently Granada's recent drama documentary "Hillsborough" and
    the Director has, for some reason, forwarded the letters to your Region.

    Your Central Casework Unit has written to our Constable Ken Greenway asking him to forward a
    video tape of the programme and then for us to give a briefing to your office about what, if anything,
    the programme might have added in the way o f material facts not placed before the courts
    previously. I am unsure about the locus o f your office in this matter but want to be as helpful as I
    possibly can. As a token of this approach, we have already sent a copy o f the videoed drama
    documentary so that your Central Casework Unit can review it.

    However, before taking the matter any further with your staff, I would like to up-date you on the
    fact that we have done a very comprehensive briefing for the Home Office on exactly the same
    subject. W e have invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in answering 10 questions
    forwarded through Labour MPs in Merseyside and Sheffield by the Home Office to us, designed to
    flush-out the precise point o f whether or not there is any new material.

    I am loath to repeat the exercise for your office when the logical link would be between the
    Director's Office and the Home Office, centrally.

    The current state o f affairs is that we have reviewed the broadcast with a fine tooth comb and have
    answered each o f the 10 questions in the fullest way possible, rather than taking a minimalist
    approach o f simply referring the enquirers to lines and paragraphs in, for example, the Taylor Inquiry
    transcript, or that o f the Coroner's Inquest, or the Judicial Review upon it. It is our firm view that
    there is absolutely no material new in the broadcast which has not been placed before the Taylor
    Inquiry, the Inquest, or the Judicial Review, and that will be my advice to the Home Secretary.

    What I now propose to do is to conclude our preparation o f the response to the 10 questions by the
    end o f next week (31 January) and send them to the Home Office. I propose also to include in that
    bundle a copy o f your letter and this reply, so that the Home Office may make contact with the
    Director and seek her views on the best way forward.

    I am also copying this letter to Donald Adams, our Chief Crown Prosecutor, for his interest.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   12 noon the first            of the L i verpool        fans       began to

arrive.         The y were       few     in number an d        in good spirits.            I had a clear '

View t hro u g h the           turns t i l e s and     could see officers            outside       s e arching      ,

them as they arrived.                    I did not se a r c h these fans as they had

a l r e a d y been searched.                However,     we were       then i n s t r u c t e d by Inspector

W hite     to search e v e r y o n e          regardless w h e t h e r     they had been searched

before      or not.



By   1.30 p.m.           the number of fans             inc r e a s e d but was     not excessive.

Most were         searched,        a few comp l a i n e d about the number                of times      they

had been s e a r c h e d         but they were         still     g e n e r a l l y good humoured.          T here

was still         -a good view t h r o u g h the turn s t i l e s and              it could be seen

that the are a outs i d e was                  still    effectively        clear.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 0 0    p.m.    the tu r n s t i l e    operator    knoc k e d on the

w i n d o w to indicate a              problem, he told us that a fan was trying                        to   get

in with o u t a ticket.                He     came   thro u g h the turnstile an d was              ejected

straight        t h r o u g h the gate         " C ’ to our     left.



In the       process       of doing this Police C o n s t a b l e McManus                and      I were

surrounded             by a number       of his      friends who were abusing              us and

in d i g n a n t l y    claiming       that     he did have a ticket.



This     h a p pened a p p r o x i m a t e l y a dozen times             in the next      twenty

minutes.          I saw same           fans    o^/ering m o n ^ / t o      the ope r a t o r s    in order     to

gain entry.             This was        ref u s e d , however and they lj^#^ the turnstile

peacefully.



By 2.30        p.m.      large    nurntiers of L i v e r p o o l       supporters    had a r r i v e d and

were     pressed up to the trunstiles.                      The View thro u g h the turnstile

w as    no longer         possible.       It q u i c k l y became a p p arent             that     the

s e arching      of fans was         no longer        practical       or possible.                The    priority

became       giving e n t r y to a s        m any ticket        holding      fans as q u i c k l y and

safely as        possible.          Fans with o u t      tickets were             still     being e j e c t e d by

P o l i c e C o n s t a b l e 2 8 1 9 McManus     and myself.



Whilst a t t e m p t i n g     to eject      one ma n t h r o u g h gate           ’C ’ , the S t e w a r d on

the gate        refused to open it because he feared that s u p p o r t e r s w ould

rush in.         He was      o r d e r e d to open the        gate and the ma n was ejected

with o u t    significant         problems.



Pressure        continue d^tfo increase             outside       the turnstiles a n d fans were

becoming        t r a p p e d r w i t h i n them as a result         causing more            problems.

L arge    numbers         of fans    enuring        the gr o u n d were           under     the    influence            of

alcohol       some quite        hs^fvily.         It was     impossible           to eject        them though

due to pressure             rfflmind both turn s t i l e s and Gate                *C * .



By 2.45       p.m.    it has      become a p p arent         that    there were                          pi^bjjems

outside.         Fans      e n t ering   the ground were            near    to collapse.                M a n y did

fall     down t h r o u g h e x h a u s t i o n   on gaining        entry.         Some     farts were

crying,       nearly all        were     e x t r e m e l y a n g r y abus i n g    us and      s^Tcmtjuiig at me

to do something.               I was     grab b e d by one hysterical                man     in his        late

twentys who          shook me v i o l e n t l y and s c r e a m e d        into/my face.

I was w i t h o u t a radio an d            continued        to assist       other        fans.         One   fan

turnstile,          it was     n e c e s s a r y to use a knife to cut him free.



B y this stage all             the officers w i t h i n Serial                     14 were          being     subjected

to abuse,         threats,         being    pushed and j o s t l e d around.                        No su p e r v i s o r y

the ground          in the a r e a        i m m e d iately next            to the turnstiles.                  We were

heavily out-numbered at                    the    point,       I believe,           of    coming          under serious

physical a t t a c k f r o m very            irrate an d upset fans.                      I have never             been

more      concerned for my own or my                     colleagues           saf



A number        of fans       had begun          climbing       o < /e r    the wall        into the          ground

                                                                              T u rnstile           'D*    collapsed

voiced by the           stewards          on the gate            The        crowd surge                hr o u g h and

people at th«           front       fell    down.        The y were          tramp l e d on by the               crowd

who    fl ooded t h r o u g h the gates,                s c reaming abuse at Police,                        striking

out at officers as                 they    charged       in.      I could see m a n y fans                    carrying

cans     of beer as they forced their way thro u g h but                                    it was        impossible

to do a n y t h i n g a bout         this.



After     the m a i n body of s upporters                  had      come through the gate,                       I helped

force the gate           shut.        During      the     surge,           I had been forced back

ag a i n s t   the wall       of t u rnstile        ’G".       I stayed there              for my own safety.

Fans who had fa l l e n were helped to their                            feet.       I would      estimate       that

a r o u n d 2 , 0 0 0 people       had ente r e d t h r o u g h the gate.              W i t h i n a moment

the gate was op e n e d for a second time and a b o u t 2 0 0 / 3 0 0 more                               fans    fan

in.     The numbers f n t e r i n g d w i n d l e d to a trickle and the gate was                               l’tfft-

ajar     to act as 'an addi t i o n a l            turnstile.           However,      there was        no-one

left outside.



The    scene      inside       could only then have            been de s c r i b e d as a             "sea of

f a n s ’ all     congregating          on the a r e a be h i n d the turns t i l e s A to G r i t -

was as though they w'er#,all                      taking    their       breath to try and/fecover,

A large       cheer went           up inside the        ground and           I watched a^'Within a

fans     running       down the t/nhel             to the    central         tyfrace.



 I looked a r o u n d "to see the other                 off icers        from my serial           more    or    less

 in tacit and thou g h t            ’thank    god t h a t ’s o v e r ’ .        I stood up for a moment

to    recover      but    looked up to see a large number                       of P o l i c e    officers,

a b o u t 30,     running a r o u n d       the foot       of the West S tand and L e p p i n g s Lane

the S o u t h StjEnd onto             the   pitch.



As    I stepped onto           the     pitch an a n n o u n c e m e n t      came over      the ground

 ’t a n n o y ’ requ e s t i n g   that L i verpool         fans    left the         pitch.       I could see

a number of fans w a n d e r i n g            up and down          in front         of the fence and more

climbing         over.     I ran up to the front               of the terrace - the                    centre

south e nc l o s u r e and was met w i t h a scene                      of   carnage.       Fans were

crushed tight            up agai n s t      the fence,       some were a l r e a d y blue faced.



Other     officers        present were            stood on the fence            shouting         for the       crowd

No.    3 had been opened but this                        did little         to help the situation.

T here     is a three          foot step up to escape                   the terrace.           The m a n who

was d i r e c t l y behind the gate w h e n                    it was    opened fell          forw a r d due to

pressure behind him.                    His      legs were       trap p e d below the          level       of the

pitch and people were                     packed tighter           t han sardines        behind, him.             Gate

3 became        blocked.            I s t r u g g l e d w i t h other       officers     to free           people.

One or two were               rescued.           The    gate    then became         c l u ttered w i t h Police,

a senior officer               ran up w i t h a Lou d Ha i l e r and began shout i n g at

officers at            gate    three to move             back to      let    people out.          Some officers;

m o v e d a way but          the    prob l e m of the trap p e d m a n              remained.         He

e f f e c t i v e l y b l o c k e d the gate           completely.          I helped a sup p o r t e r          out

a n d e s c orted          him to the          penalty a rea of the            pitch.        He a p p e a r e d to be

r ecovering           so    I placed him in the                recovery      position.          I looked up and

saw officers               trying    to    pull     down the       fence     in front        of CS enclosure.

I ran to assist,               but this          excercise        proved futile.             I hel p e d some

fans     over the           top of the fence and                returned to Gate 3.

Th r o u g h o u t   this     peripd       the officers at            the front of the fence had

  een s u bjected to/a hail                     of m i s s i l e ^ / f r o m the    crowd.      The    b lue     crash

although         I cannot          be certain of what              the miss i e s were.            I a s s i s t e d at

Gate 3 and            carried,       w i t h other       officers,        eight      bodies     from the

terrace.             I attempted          to    r esuscitate       four of these to no avail.



The    crowd up a g a i n s t          the fence were            still      being     crushed,        unable       to

help t h e m s e l v e s      due to being weak                t h r o u g h lack of air.         Anot h e r

p r o b l e m was      that, people            had d i e d   in the     crush and were           lying as 'dead

weight*       on people who were                   still     alive.      The       ninth body      I removed was

p l a c e d on a mak e         shift s t retcher - a piece of a d v e r t i s i n g                    board and          I

carried him to the              gymnasiurr»y/l w rote my number on his hand and

returned to the           pitch where        I a t t e n d e d to the       injured.      I Cat ried a

young     lad of about          12 years     of age to th^          gym n a s i u m for t r ansport to

hospital.         I then       refMUur^



The    body was        subsequently numbered                       - He was a male white,                about

5 0 years,      brown greying            hair and moustache,           5'11"     tall,    wearing a

blue shirt,          white T shirt,         grey trousers a n d socks,             black shoes and

wear i n g a gold        c o l oured R o t a r y wrist w a t c h on his          left wrist.       He had

no     identifiable       p r o perty -     (£36    cash,    a cigarette         lighter an d packets

of     cigs).     I r e m ained wit h the          body   carrying out duties as

instructed,          i.e. Ge n     18 p r e p a r a t i o n for   p hotograph etc.



At 8 . 3 0    p.m.     I h a n d e d the body over        to a CID Officer a n d           c o m pleted a

CJ A Sta t e m e n t    to that     effect.



I went       off duty at 9 . 0 0 p.m.



1 am aware        that    it    is inevitable        that     there will       be c r i t i c i s m of

various aspe c t s        of the      incident at Hills b o r o u g h .          I feel,     however,

that     given the       circumstances,          the decisions          taken,    particularly           in

relation to open i n g gates,               were    correct.        I fully support          them and

feel     it was      the only      course of a c t i o n     to take.



There     is little       point     in    ’iffing"     and    ’butting*      about P o l i c e action.

T he   c i r c umstances were        s o mething     that    could never have            been   prepared

for and       I am sure        if it h a p p e n e d tomorrow,        most    officers w o u l d behave

in the same manner.               Very    little,      if a n y t h i n g   could have     been done          to

prevent      the tragedy.

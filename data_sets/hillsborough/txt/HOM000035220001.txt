   ADJOURNMENT DEBATE: WEDNESDAY 26 OCTOBER            '
   SIR MALCOLM THORNTON (Con - Crosby) ON THE HILLSBOROUGH
   DISASTER - THE CASE OF KEVIN WILLIAMS


   We have been advised today by the Chief Whip's Office that Sir
   Malcolm Thornton MP intends to raise the subject of Kevin
   Williams, a victim of the Hillsborough disaster, in an
   adjournment debate on Wednesday 26 October. Assuming business
   follows its normal course, this half-hour debate should come
   on at 10pm. I will inform you nearer the time if there is any
   change to these arrangements.

   I would be grateful therefore if you would set in hand the
   preparation of a short speech of about ten minutes' duration
   for Mr Baker's use, together with any necessary background
   material, to reach Mr Amos (copied to me please) by close of
   play on Monday 24 October.

   It would be helpful if you could let Andrew Englefield (ext
   3526) know which officials will be attending the debate.

       Dear Mr Whalley

       THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER -
       ENQUIRY BY THE RT HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

       With reference to the above-noted subject, I write on behalf of the
       Chief Constable, Mr Sloan, to invite His Lordship, Lord Justice Taylor,
       to consider visiting Strathclyde Police area to view or attend at some
       of our major stadia in the near future.

       Two games which may be of interest are (i) the SKOL Cup Final due to be
       played at Hampden Park at 3 pm on Sunday, 22 October 1989 where the current
       semi-finalists are Rangers versus Dunfermline Athletic and Celtic versus
       Aberdeen, thus having the possibility of a Rangers versus Celtic Cup Final
       incorporating a number of football dimensions including sectrarianism and
       (ii) an "Old Firm" League Match viz Rangers versus Celtic at Ibrox Park at
       3 pm on Saturday, 4 November 1989.

       Should this invitation be accepted I shall arrange to contact you by
       telephone in order that we may provide all the facilities you require.

       Yours sincerely




                      O '.       â–  V 'S *

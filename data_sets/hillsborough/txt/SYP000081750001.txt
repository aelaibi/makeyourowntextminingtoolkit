On    the    way     to    the       Ground         I saw        sujyrorters             outside          pubs    drinking             and

drinking          from     cans       in the         street,

I sa w      one     or    two    Police         Officers              about        and       they    pointed          us    in the

getting        to    the       turnstiles.

I saw       some     stewards           outside            the    turnstiles                 but    not a n y P o l i c e

                        At     this       time       I j u st          thought         that       it w a s     people           who      were      injured             being

                         I did          not    assist           anyone          who    was    dead       or    injured.

                         I think          that       a factor              in    the       deaths       or    injuries            caused        wa s     that          the

                         fences          were       too       high.

 _________ - CONTROL ASSISTANT
(Day Off)


Date:   18.4.89

Time:   0945-1005




About 1515 I received a call f r o m _______ concerning an incident at
Hillsborough and asking me to report for duty.

I arrived at approximately 1530 and immediately manned a telephone
position. Phones were very busy, but people wre methodically answering
them.

Many of the calls were from the Press. As more staff came on duty, the
monarch Switchboard was put into operation and this relieved the pressure,
calls being put on hold.

I did take one call from the Police requesting vehicles to attend at the
'Gymnasium' entrance.

I left the unit at one stage to go shopping for sandwiches. This about
1930. My main work was concerned with answering telephones.

I was released from duty at 2045.

              Lawrence YOXALL states:-

              1-              I am employed as a qualified ambulance man with SYMAS.

              2.              My date of birth is        L             ,                 I■1—
                              I have been with SYMAS since 1976 (000076), and became a

                              qualified ambulance man in 1977 (000077).

              4.              I was        luty on Saturday 15th April              (150489) and wanted

                              to attend the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest FA Cup

                              Semi-final at Hillsborough.                  I attend football matches

                              quite regularly and try to see Liverpool                 play fairly often

                              because my 12 year old son is a Liverpool                 supporter.     On

                              this occasion my son was not going to accompany me to the

                              match.

              5.              I did not have a ticket for the match but I knew that some
                                                                    PAGE
                                                                    S2536

         Liverpool  fans were going to a pub^xn Barnsley for lunch
                               A/d'z (-__
         and so rny friend,               , and I went there to see if

         we could obtain any spare tickets.       We arrived at the pub

         at 1130 and we bought two tickets for the Leppings Ln

         Stand at £3-T.

6.       We went to Hillsborough,   parking at Parsons Cross Estate

         which is about a mile from the ground and walking down to

         Leppings Ln from tj>e^North.    We arrived outsTde the ground

         at about    1440.

         Before approaching the turnstiles,       fans have to go through

         some large blue wrought    iron gates.    As we walked through

         these gates a policeman closed one side of the gates and I

         turned and closed the other side behind me.

S.       There was a^ri^ss of people outside the turnstiles and no

         queues.     I stood on a stanchion which supports a metal wall

         dividing turnstiles A/G from turnstiles       1— 16 in order see

         over the heads of the people in front of me.        I could see

         that it might be possible to walk around the crowd and get

         in through the far right-hand turnstile.        I could not at

         the time see that there was a metal       rail alongside the

         entrance to turnstile G.     I told        to follow me and we

         went around the back of the crowd,       passing to the extreme

         right where the crush was were not too bad.        As we

         approached the far right-hand turnstile a concertina exit

         gate   (gate C) which is to the right of the turnstiles was

         open and I walked straight     into the ground.    The time was
     r
         shortly after 1440.    The doors were slammed shut behind me

         and my friend was unable to get in.        I do not know who
&
         opened that gate,    nor do I know who closed it.     I would
V
         estimate that about    100 other people walked in with me.
                                                                     PAGE     3
                                                                     S2S36

       As a result of going into the ground that way my ticket

       was not checked and I still have my complete ticket.

       I was now in the area behind the Leppings Ln stand.

       There were several      people there but the crowds were not

       nearly as bad as they had been outside.          I waited there for

       about 5 minutes      in an attempt to meet up with

       and I bought a programme whilst      I waited.    There were people

       milling about in this area but it was not too crowded and I

       thought everyone there was waiting for their companions

       outs id e .

10,          did not appear and as it was approaching kick-off time

       I walked to the right of the Leppings Ln stand and took up

       a spot on the corner of the ground underneath the score

       board.     I did not go down the tunnel    in the middle of the

       stand because I, had been there on previous occasions and I

       knew it would be very crowded.       Whilst   I was waiting   in the

       yard there were not any crowds in the tunnel         but I could

       see the crowd at the very front      <i.e. at the ground end) of

       the tunnel, although I was not taking any particular notice,

11     A couple of minutes after I had taken my position the game

      ✓Kicked off at 1459,      but like a lot of the people around me

       I was watching the crowd behind the goal and not the game.

       Peop le were already ^.limbing the fence to get onto the

       field.

12,    During those first five minutes of the game I heard two

       messages      come over the PA system.   One was for Liverpool

       supporters to stop puffing in the Leppings Ln end of the

       ground and the other was for people to clear the playing

      referee.     The game was stopped and the players     left the

      field.     By now there were quite a number of people on the

      field and I could see some people on the pitch trying to

      resuscitate a youngster.       People around me stood staring

      in silence.     I remember seeing a St J o h n ’s ambulanceman

      run down alongside the South Stand with an oxygen b o tt le .

      The time w a s 1512.

14.   I decided to try to get onto the pitch.        I could not move

      forwards and I realised I would have to leave the area

      where I was standing and try another entrance with the

      help of the police.

      As I came round the corner of the Leppings Ln stand near

      the entrance to the tunnel there were people lying on the

      ground.     A policeman and a supporter were resuscitating a

      man in his late 3 0 ’s near the tunnel entrance.         As I bent

      down they asked if I could help.         I tried to resuscitate

      him but I realised it was too late.        He had no pulse and

      his eyes were dilated.       He was   clearly dead and in my

      opinion had been dead for some time.         I cannot say for

      how long,    I am not a doctor,    but from his colour    (blue)

      he had clearly not been breathing for some time.

16.   Nearby a man of about 30 was lying on the ground and he

      was being turned on his side.         I checked him but he too

      was dead.

17.   I went to another      casualty.   He was being attended to by

      people who seemed to know what they were doing.           They had

      him on his side and he was breathing.         As I looked around

      people were being left on the ground with their faces

      already covered over.       I went over to a man of about      16

      whose face had been covered and a youth was standing near

                   him in tears.             I asked if he knew him and he replied,

                   "No."         All this occurred within a minute or so of my

                   arriving at the scene.

       18,         I noticed an ambulance had arrived outside C g a t e .                I went

                   down to the gate to speak to the crew.               They were a

               y/resus c itat ing a casualty in the gateway.              I spoke to     I ZZl
                   as he was loading            casualties   into the ambulance.       I tried

                   to impress upon him the seriousness of the situation inside

                   the ground and I asked him if he knew how many ambulances

                   were coming.            He told me that 20 ambulances would be coming.

       19.         As the ambulance            left I spoke to a police officer,        I believe

                   an Inspector,           and I told him that we had to get casualties

                   down to the gate ready for the ambulances and that the

                   other supporters had to be kept out of the way.

       10.         As I returned through C gate into the crowd a policeman and

                   policewoman were attending a youngster just outside C Gate.

                   I asked how he was and they told me he was all right at

                   present.             I checked his pulse which was strong and I told

                   them I would try to get him a stretcher when one became

                   av a i l a b l e .

       Z1          I helped a number of casualties down to C gate.                    Most of

                   these     casualties were able to walk but complained about

                   chest pains.             I helped to carry one man with a group of

                   other people,           he was being dragged and was clearly

                   distressed.

       22,         We placed the casualties against the wall outside C gate.

                   There      is a plan attached to this statement.            The

                   casualties were            placed in the area marked with a yellow

    line.    Other people also took casualties down to the same

    area.

    At 1335 another ambulance had arrived on the scene/v< at

    Leppings Ln and I recognised Leading Ambulanceman

    as one member of the crew.         I informed him of the situation

    and I helped load casualty onto his ambulance.             This
y
    casualty was a man of about 40 with crush injuries and

    breathing difficulties.         I also loaded a youngster onto

              s ambulance and I travelled in the back of this

y ^ m b u l a n c e with LA         and the two casualties to

    Northern General.         As we left the scene I could see that

    another ambulance had arrived.           We drove along the service

    road to Penistone Rd and from there to the Northern General

    Hospital.     During the journey I was trying to keep an

    oxygen mask on the 40 year old patient.             We arrived at the

    casualty area where the hospital seemed to be prepared for

    a large number of casualties.           We lifted the patient with

    the help of a porter because the patient was struggling so

    much.    We put him onto heavy duty trolley.           The other

    casualty was unloaded by hospital          staff.    The time was

    shortly after      1550 and we went straight back to the ground,

    to the Leppinqs Ln end.

    When we arrived at the Leppings Ln end of the ground we

    loaded up two stretcher        cases.    Both were men of about 20

    who were fully conscious and had crush injuries.              We also

    loaded up two walking casualties.           One of these was holding

    his chest and both appeared to be suffering from shock.                   A

    nurse also got into the ambulance.           We left LA             Iat

    the ground and went to the Royal Hal lamshi re Hospital where

    we arrived at the fracture entrance.           I explained to the

                                                                          S2536

            doctor briefly what the apparent        injuries were and he put

            the patients   into categories.    We simply unloaded them and

            returned to the ground.

25.       ^A ie arrived back at the Leppings Ln end of the ground from
            the south and again pulled into the service road.         There

            was an ambulance   present already full of sitting cases and

            there did not seem any further need for my assistance.

            Leading Ambulance man             was   iri the area and he

            returned to the ambulance.    As there was nothing further for

            rne to do I started to look for my friend                        He

            did not seem to be in the area of the Leppings Ln entrance

            and so I returned to the car where he was waiting.            I had

            left the ground at 1625.

HILLSBOROUGH : COMPENSATION

Following the Home Secretary's statement to the House on 17 April

about the Hillsborough tragedy, Mr Frank Field MP asked about

automatic compensation for those involved.



2.      The Home Secretary undertook to look at the matter further.

The relevant extract from Hansard is attached as is a draft
reply



3.      In some recent disasters (eg the Clapham rail crash) there

has been an early or immediate acceptance of liability by the

organisation involved.     This was possible because only one

organisation could be liable and the organisation involved

accepted that it was liable.    This showed the organisation

involved in a good light and speeded payment.
4.   For the Hillsborough tragedy however no such approach seems

possible.   Liability may fall upon the police, or the club or

perhaps the local authority who issued the safety certificate.     A

court might rule that liability might fall wholly upon one party,

or jointly between two or more, or upon no-one if it judged that

there was no negligence involved.   (Advice from L.A.B. is that it

is by no means clear that someone or some organisation will be

found to be liable).   It has been reported in the press that a

Liverpool solicitor has already served writs upon the police and

the club.   At worst, it could be several years before liability

is resolved.



5.   Discussion with both Legal Advisers Branch and Lord

Chancellor's Department suggests that there is no quick or easy

means of resolving the liability question.   It seems almost

inevitable that the legal processes should be gone through until

a court judgement is established.



6.   The bulk of the attached draft reply has been prepared by

Lord Chancellor's Department who are taking forward the principal

recommendations of the Civil Justice Review Body.   The

recommendations of the review which have been accepted will

provide for simplification of court procedures and advances in

the speed with which cases come to a conclusion.



7.   In his question in the House, Mr Field asked about automatic

compensation, which implies compensation without fault.    Lord

Chancellor's Department advise that the question of no fault

compensation has been debated for many years.   The Lord
 Chancellor has no plans to introduce a comprehensive systemof       no

 fault compensation, but he is considering the recommendation of

 the Civil Justice Review that possible schemes for no fault

 compensation for minor road accident injuries should be examined.



 8.     I should mention that, at Prime Ministers Questions on

 25 April, Mr Field asked about the effect of payments from the

 Hillsborough Disaster Fund upon those in receipt of social

^ ^ c u r i t y benefits.   No. 10 have asked Department of Social

 Security to provide a draft reply.




                                                F J ARCHER
Following my statement to the House on 17 April about the

Hillsborough tragedy you asked about compensation for those

affected.     I undertook to look at the matter further. I have

since received your letter of 19 April suggesting that we might

discuss the matter.



Your desire to ensure that the victims and relatives of the

tragedy at Hillsborough receive compensation as quickly as

possible is obviously one which I share.     As you know, the

Government has already announced a contribution of half a million

pounds to the disaster fund which has been established.     I expect

that a sizeable fund will be likely to emerge through the

generosity of members of the public.     I have no doubt that those

responsible for administering the fund will ensure that payments

are made in cases of hardship as quickly as possible.



One possible avenue for .compensation which may be open to the

victims and their dependents is for them to bring civil claims.

I can well understand the difficulties that this will entail for

them, firstly because of the time involved and secondly because

of the need under the present system to prove fault on the part

of another.



Although it may be of little comfort to those involved in this

disaster, as you will be aware the Lord Chancellor recently

announced that the Government has accepted the principal

recommendations of the Civil Justice Review Body, which reported

in June 1988.     The report contained recommendations on the reform

of civil litigation in general as well as some recommendations
specifically directed at the particular area of personal injury

litigation.   The recommendations which have now been accepted are

directed to the simplification of court procedures, with the hope

of significant advances in the speed and accessibility of justice

in the near future.   As the Lord Chancellor made clear in his

announcement, this is an area of major concern to which the

Government is giving a high priority.   The Government has however

no plans to introduce a system of no fault compensation which

would cover every kind of injury (but, although not related to

xhis case, the Lord Chancellor is considering the recommendation

of the Civil Justice Review that possible schemes for no fault

compensation for minor road accident injuries should be

examined).



I should be glad to discuss the position regarding compensation

for those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy with you if you so

wish.   But, since the Government lead on legislative changes lies

with the Lord Chancellor, you might think it more valuable to

discuss the matter with him.   I shall therefore copy your letter

and this reply to the Lord Chancellor for his information.

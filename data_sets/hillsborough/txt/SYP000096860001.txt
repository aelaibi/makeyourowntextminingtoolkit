Dear Mr Denton


HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION - FURNIVAL HOUSE


As discussed in our recent telephone conversation, I will be attending Snig
Hill on     Friday 3    August 1990 to confirm arrangement for security of
Furnival House now that the West Midlands Police Liaison Officers are
returning to the West Midlands. I thought it may be of benefit to confirm
the arrangement in writing, the main issues being as follows

a)          SECURITY OF THE BUILDING - ALARM ACTIVATION

           As you are aware the second, third and fourth floor of the building
           were made available for West Midlands Police. The third and fourth
           are secured by locks. On the second floor, entry may be gained by
           insertion of a coded number into a digital lock and a separate lock
          with a key. In addition the floor is secured by means of
           infra-red lights and an alarm supplied by Modern Alarms. Any
^        - unauthorised access to the floor activates an intruder alarm in the
w         Force Control Room, West Midlands Police. Present arrangements
           require that one of the duty officers is contacted by radio pager,
           and will attend Furnival House supported by a uniform presence
           from South Yorkshire Police.

            I have advised West Midlands Police Force Control Room that with effect
            from Saturday 4 August 1990, any alarm activation should be directed
            straight through to the Force Control Room in South Yorkshire
            Police. I would be grateful if you would advise them of the
            necessary arrangements for police turnout. In addition, I will be
            handing to you a security bag which will be sealed with a security
            seal. Inside the bag will be the code for the access through the
            numerical lock, key for the door and directions for resetting the
            alarm.




                                                                                                                                                                                 cont.




     THE OFFICER DEALING WITH THE CORRESPONDENCE IS................................................................................................... EXTENSION
b)      FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT

        Certain items of equipment have already been returned to West
        Midlands Police. As it is envisaged that the second floor will be
        used from time to time for enquiries, other items will remain
        together with all the furniture purchased by South Yorkshire
        Police. You may wish to review the arrangements for insurance of
        the items while the premises remain unattended.


c)      CLEANING

        As you are aware, South Yorkshire Police have placed an order with
        Ideal Cleaning for cleaning of Furnival House. The daily cleaner
        has been advised that he will not be needed on a regular basis         s
        with effect from end of work of Friday 3 August 1990. You may p a          ^
        wish to write to the company to confirm arrangements with them
        formally. I have sent a personal letter to the cleaner thanking
        him for his services which have been greatly appreciated.


d)     NATIONAL CAR PARK - CAR PARK PASSES

        The car park passes issued to West Midlands Police officers, for use
        during the Inquest, have now expired. No arrangements were made
        for updated passes to be issued. The Liaison Officers using the
        office since the Inquest have arranged via the car park attendant
        to stamp their tickets and recharge has been made accordingly.

3)     TELEPHONE/HEATING/LIGHTING

        It is envisaged that the second floor will still be used by West
        Midlands Police officers on an infrequent basis. For that reason
        it would be helpful if all essential services, including
        telephones, could be left connected. The heating has been turned
        off and I envisage that the cost will be confined to little more
        than the monthly rental.



As ever your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely




Principal Administrative Officer

                SUBJECT:   hillsborough tragedy inquest -
                           HEADQUARTERS UNDERGROUND CAR PARK



                Subject to Police Authority decisions to be made on 16 November 1990
                and/or legal Hearings, the inquests into the Hillsborough Tragedy
                will commence on Monday 19 November 1990.


                RESERVED SPACES

                 Two spaces have been reserved in the Underground Car Park at Headquarters
                 for the duration of the Inquest, one for the Road Traffic vehicle
                 which will ferry police officers to and from the Town Hall, the
                 other for MR PETER METCALF, the briefing Barrister who will be attached
                 to Headquarters.  (Details of his vehicle not yet to hand).
                 MR METCALF will be assisted here and at the Town Hall Inquest by
                 three other legal officers     LAWRENCE OLD
                                                RICHARD HANSON
                                                 LIZA THORNTON




                 It is anticipated that they will, after the first day, accompany
                 MR METCALF in his vehicle, or park elsewhere, as the current problems
                 within the underground car park preclude the parking of any additional
                 vehicles.  The Force Control Room staff should carefully monitor
                 any problems in line with the recent Circular regarding carparking.




                 POLICE OFFICERS ATTENDING INQUESTS

                 Unauthorised Police Officers, whether in police vehicles or their
                 private vehicles, cannot be allowed to park in the Underground Car
                 Park due to the number of officers being warned to attend each day
                 and the ongoing problems with parking. All officers are being warned
                 to attend Room 159 at Headquarters in the first instance so that
                 they can be suitably briefed and relaxed prior to being transported
                 to andfrom the Town Hall. Refreshments and meal tickets (where
                 applicable) will be made available for all the officers at Headquarters.

                 In order to ensure that minimum stress or anxiety is caused to our
                 colleagues because of parking problems at Headquarters it is requested
                 that


                 i)          Sub-Divisional/Departmental Commanders be asked to
                             provide police transport to convey officers between
                             their own Sections and Police Headquarters;   or

ii)         Individual Officers use their own vehicles, park in
            a nearby private car park and claim reimbursement of
            the appropriate parking fees.

        Dear Sir

        HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SECURITY FURNIVAL HOUSE

        We have r e c e n t l y discussed the security of Furnival House, the arrangements for
        which will change with effect from 16 November 1990.

        I can confirm that the Security bag with keys and alarm activation procedure
        will be collected from West Bar Police Station on 16 November 1990. The
        combination for re-setting the alarm will be changed on that day.

        In the event of an alarm activation after 16 November 1990, the following will
        be adopteds-

                    A)          Monday Sam to Friday 6pm each week (on a 24 hour basis). In the event
                                that the intruder alarm is activated, the Force Control Room at Snig
                                Hill will receive a call from West Midlands Police Control Room
                                requesting Uniform officers to attend Furnival House. Upon arrival
                                your officers should not enter the 2nd floor. West Midlands Police
                                Officers will attend the scene having been alerted by a message on
                                their radio pagers.

                     B)          Friday 6pm to Monday 8am (on a 24 hour basis).

                                 Procedure as per A above.
                                 The scene will be attended by a security guard for Securiguard. He
                                 will enter the building with your officers and re-set the alarm as
                                 necessary. He will then be required to make a telephone report to
                                 Detective Superintendent Beechey in the West Midlands.

           X can confirm that I have placed an order with Securiguard for these services
           and will arrange for the costs, (which are very "moderate"!) to be recharged.


           Yours sincerely

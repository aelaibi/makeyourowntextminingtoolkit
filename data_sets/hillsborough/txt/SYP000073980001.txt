the    Hop       I had       cause          to    remove          a    can       of       beer       from       one    fan       though       it          was

impossible          to       do    anything             about          the       fan       due       to    the       enormous          amount             of

people       in    the       stand          and       the    crush          that          we    were       in,       the    beer       being

merely       removed          from          his       hand    and          poured          away.           Several          times       during

this    journey          through             the       crowd          in    the       stand          myself          and    PC    Bellemy             who

was    still       with       me       were       forced          backwards                by       the    crowd       surging          and

was    fearful          at    that          time       and    fans          around             me    also       appeared          in a       similar

frame       of    mind       to    myself.              We    had          to    fight          our       way    through          the       crowd          in

order       to    return          to    our       serial.              Several             times          during       the       journey          a

young       girl    who       was       in       front       of       me    was       forced           backwards            by    the       crowd

and    I had       to    push          her       forwards             to    hold          her       iri a n     upright          position.                 I

was    relieved          when          we    eventually                reached             our       serial          which       was    now

virtually          cut       off       from       other      Officers                 in       the    ground          and    as    far       as       I

could       see    were       the       only          Officers             in    the       Kop.




I then       became          part       of       the    barrier            again           between             the    two    opposing

groups       and    crowds             of    people          were          crushed             up    against          us    both       on    the

Liverpool          side       and       the       Nottingham               Forest              side       of    the    human       barrier.

Whilst          in    this          position                around          2.50          pm    <1450        hrs)           a man       on    the       Motts

Forest          side       of       the          barrier          fainted              due      to     the       crush       and       I pulled             him

to    the       Liverpool                side          of    the          barrier           and      laid        him       down    at    the       back       of

the    Liverpool                section                and       together             with        PC    Bellemy             we    aided       hi m.          He

came       round          after          a       short       time          and       we     cleared          a    space          for    him       at    the

back       and       sat       him       down.              His       name       was                        rorti N o t t i n g h a m        he    remained

there       for       a    while             then          I do       not       know        where       he       went




At    3.04       pm       <1504          hrs)          I saw          a    large          number        of       fans       spilling          onto          the

pitch       from          the       Leppings                Ln    stand          and        I thought             there          had    been       an

invasion             of    the       pitch.                 I continued                   to    watch        for       several          minutes.              The

mood       of    the       fans          still             crushed          against             me     and       other       Officers             appeared

to    be    a    little             frightened                   by       the    crush          that        they       were       still       in.           I did

not    know          what       was          happening                at    the       other          side        of    the       ground       and       after

several          minutes             I heard                something                about        fatalities                in    the    ground.              I

was    then          directed                by       my    Sergeant             to       escort        a    group          of    Liverpool             fans

in    our       section             out          of    the       ground          as       they       wished           to    leave.           This       I did

together             with       other             Officers                again        including             PC       Bellemy.           We       escorted

them       through             the       Notts             Forest          fans        to      the     middle          entrance          into          the    Hop

where       we       parted          company                with          them.           The     journey             through          the    crowd          this

time       did       not       appear             as       when       I    last       made        my    way       through          the       fans,          there

wasn't          as    much          of       a    crush,          once          you       had     cleared             the    section          where          our

barrier          was.




On    reaching             the       middle                entrance             to    the       Hop     myself             and    PC    Bellemy             were

approached                by    a    young             man       and       his       f a t h e r , J/ye y o u n g e r             man    said          he    was

a    Doctor          and       wanted             to       help       on    the        p i t p z h / c« u 1 d w e          get    him    down          there.

Myself          and       PC    Bellemy                escorted             him^/ml/of                 the       stand       and       down       onto       the

Doctor       down       to    the          pitch       together             with       his          father          entering          onto       the

pitch    by       through          the       entrance                between          the       Hop       and       the       North    Stand.               At

this    location             we    parted             company          with       the          Doctor          and       1 saw       numerous

people       being       carried             past          me    on    bill       boards             some          of    which       were       injured

and    several          of    which          appeared                dead,       the       only       dead          person       I recall              was

a    large    fat       male       with          an    orange          T    shirt          pulled          over          his    face,       I did

see    other       people          that          appeared             dead       but       I    cannot             recall       what       they

looked       like.           The       people          were          being       carried             by    both          fans    and       Police

Officers,          the       scene          was       chaotic          and       I felt             horrified             at    what       I was

seeing.           I tried          to       comfort             some       distraught                fans          that       were    near       me

they    were       upset          though          they          did    smell          of       drink       I can          definitely              say

that.        I then          walked          onto          the       pitch       and       saw       numerous             injured          people

with    various          people             tending             to    them.




Together          with       PC    Bellemy             I went          to       another             fan    who          was    lying       on    the

floor    with          people          round          him,       he    appeared                dead.               We    were    about          to     try

resuscitation                on    him       when          a    man    who       said          he    was       a    Doctor       came       and        he

tended       to    the       fa n,         the    fan          was    about       thirty             stocky             build    with       jeans

on.     I then          saw       fans       running             down       the       pitch          from          the    direction             of     the

Leppings          Ln    stand          and       we    were          ordered          by       either          an       Inspector          of    Chief

Inspector          to    form          a    11 ne      ac:ross         the       pitch          to    prevent             disorder          which           we

did.     1 remained                in       this       position             till       the          first          tannoy       message           to

clear    the       ground          which          was          about       40    minutes             on    the          pitch,       the    scene

was    still       chaotic,                during          this       time       numerous             Liverpool                fans    were

abusive       towards             us       and    a    lo t      were       drunk.              Some       still          appeared          to       want

to    fight       I just          c o u l d n ’t       believe             their       actions.

            unprofessional.                 I saw       Chief    Simper i       ntendent          Nesbit       whilst          on    the      pitch

            this     was    after          quite       sorn^/time      and       he    appeared          to    take       some       control

            over'   the     situation.




            Fans     started          to    clear       the   ground        and       the    flow       of    casualties             which       had

            been     coming       past       me    had    now    almost          ceased,          and    together             with      other

            officers        I was          ordered       onto    Penistone             Rd    opposite          the       gym    entranceand

            I    remained        in    this       position       for       about       30    minutes.           I then         saw      PS

            gym.      We    were       then       ordered       onto       transit          patrol       by    a   senior           officer       and

            After      some      time       we    were     stood     down        and    returned             to t h e    ground         where         we

            were     stood       down       by    Chief       Superintendent                Nesbit       a n d we       returned           to

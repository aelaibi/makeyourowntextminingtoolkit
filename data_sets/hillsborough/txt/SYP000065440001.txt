1 was       just        panicking              and    knew       I had       to     get     out.            I climbed            on     to p     of

the     people          in the        crowd.           They       were       packed         so       tightly,           I just          crawled

across        them       I was        on t h e i r         shoulders.               I was        going        to     the      left       and

carried          on     crawling.               I then          fell      into      the     a r e a m a r k e d 5 on               the        map,,

goal     and       saw       that     the       people          in the       terracing               behind        the       goal       were

I realised              my    brother           was    in t h e re          so    I went         back        down       to    the       g a te    and

pleaded with                 the     Policemen              to    let     me      through,            s a y i n g my     brother          was

I went        across          to     the       fence        behind          the    goal.             1 c o u l d see      there          were

            my      statement        a man        in a b l a c k       leather       jacket      w ho     was    crushed        up

            against         the    barrier         in    pen    four.       The      man appeared            dead.           He w as   blue

            and      did    not a p p e a r       to    be    breathing.          I cannot           of    course       be    certain       that

            he w a s       in f a c t    dead.          The    m a n was    dark       skinned,           possibl y Asian.             He

            definitely            had    no m o u s t a c h e .        I cannot        recall        anything          about    his

            clothing            except      the    black       leather      jacket.           T he    jacket       wa s      in the

             (Ref     F P 9 / A / 4 / 2 8 )(Ek                    ).     This     is    not    the        type   of     jacket       worn     by

            the      man    I have       described.             The     jacket       in the      photograph             is    too    bulky.

            I have       viewed        photograph          (Ref M W / 1/ 3 ) (Ex                           ).     This     shows          a

            man      on a s t r e t c h e r .      The     man    shown       (28)     is    not     the m a n     I describe              in

            my    statement.

            (Ex                   ).     This      is not        the   man      I describe           in m y     statement.




            I have       viewed a        photo/video             print       (Ref M A P 9 / 0 Q . 1 1 . 0 2 . 1 9 )

            this      photograph         strongly          resembles          the    man    that      I describe,         although                I

H i l l s bo ro ug h.   The driver,          twice under      pressu re          from passengers,             tried

to s top for d i s e m b a r k m e n t       near    the end of the L ep p in g s Ln but was

r efused       perm is si on by Police.             As a result we had to park a bout half to

three     quarters        of a mile a wa y to join the                 line of other             coaches.      The

time was know 2. 3 0 p m             (1430)    to 2.35pm       (1435).

B ot h my son and m yself               j ogged towards       the ground,              w h i ch was    not easy

as we had to keep dodging a mo ng st             the large numbers of L iv er p oo l                           fans

who we re s t e a d i l y , but not h a s t i l V w a l k i n g towards the ground.

As    usual     there were         numerous      te^Tiagers e n q u ir i ng        if fans had spare

tickets        for sale.

O n our arrival           at the g r o u n d/ ab ou t 2. 3 5 p m       (1435)      to 2 . 4 0 p m     (1440),    we

split     up as my son had a strand ticket a nd we                         could see that              his

e nt ra nc e    gates were         not too h ea vi ly       congested.

I then a t t e m p t e d to find the best way                  into the t er r ac e d section.                 This

proved d ifficult              because a w edge of fans               s e em ed stuck by the first set

of gates,        and e ntrance          into the g ro un d      looked          limited to one

doorway.        Further a h ea d        I could see full           q ueues at the           turnstiles.

T here was       no     real    place to join the wedge                of fans         o ut side as     it was

not    in any way a queue and no f or wa rd m o v e m en t was                          taking       place.

were stood at the top of                                                 a 10 metre high                            bank              on the other        side of the

I think,            who          I saw on the BBC News,                                              who was then moving,                               on foot,

amongst           the         crowd.

I felt this                   footage must have                                 been shot                     prior                   to 2.35     (1435)     to 2.4 0 p m

pres su re           on the gates.                            He was also giving                                        ins tr uc ti on s          to the 3

     and the doubles blue               door were        in a line w i t h each other,                thus

            own view from the banking,                    yet    there was        no sign of the L a n d Rover.

            The    crowd,        w h ic h was    s u b s t a n t i a l l y filling    the   road,    was also g re ater

           B y this        time t lie re we re only a handful                of      people at the tur nst i 1 es and

           e nt r an c e    to the g ro un d was a formality.                  As     I passed      into the t ur n st i le

           a p pr oa ch es,       u n i fo rm ed P olic e were u sh er in g about 6 teenage

            fans out of the g round because                      they had no tickets.               An O f fi c e r    then

           a p p r o a c h e d me a nd said,         "Y/6u can't get         in here w it ho ut a t ic k et . " He

            I seem to        recall       t hat/the      roar w h ic h a l wa y s      greets    the kick -o ff

            o c c u rr ed as      I was    go/ing t hr ou gh the t un st i le s and             I saw only a few

            fans    in the a rea          leading      to the tunnel         u n d e r n e a t h the stands.          In fact

            I      r elieved myself a ga i n s t           the wall       o ut side     the toilet        (adjacent          to the

            tunnel     e n t r a n c e ), because        so few people were a r o u n d and there was

            a sea of urine to neg ot ia te                  before e vejp^Teachi ng the              proper toilets.

            Never    having        stood on the Hi 11 sbop*5ugh terra ce s                   b e f o r e , I had no          idea

            that    the re were          two side e nti^mces             to the view in g area and s i mp ly

B y this time the m a t c h was                  in progress,        as    I could     p a rt ia ll y observe

by s tanding 3 or 4 m eters                    back from the tunnel               exit and taking

advantage         of the slope             by looking at some of the                pitch b e tw ee n the

ceiling and the tops of                     p e o p l e ’s heads.    For a few minutes              I was able

to w a t c h    play swi t ch from one end ofJ^fS'^gr ound to the othe r . P er h ap s

a dozen fans              came    past me      in Jiffs 5 m in ut e        p e r i o d , forcing

thei r way        into the back^Or              the    crowd.      I had a l r e a d y d ec i de d a ga i ns t

this a ct io n because               I was u nc e r t a i n as      to the true        posi ti on on the

terraces.         My a p p r e h e n s i o n was soon borne out w h e n 3 or 4 a du lt s

e x t r i c a t e d thems el ve s       from this         crowd,    w i t h obvious     d i f f i c u l t y and

r e c o v er ed them se lv es          in the e mpty        passageway.        Two were      b re at hi ng

e x c e s s i v e l y and one was           sweating       profusely,       some said it was w orse

than Heysel          down there.            I then saw for the only time a s                             squat man

in a dull y e l l o w            plastic     top,     who was e v i d e n t l y a Steward.           (This was

printed        in small          letters     on the       lower    back of h                     He w al ke d

to the     rear of the              crowd,     t hough     I can't     recall      if he went        in or      came

away.    The      rear of the           crowd behind the goal ware                  packed but        s t at i o n a r y

b et we en 3 . 0 0 p m      (1500)      and 3 . 0 5 p m    (1505)    a nd there was         no sign of

concern or          panic.        None at the back a t t e m p t e d to move away.

Whilst     play was          still      in motion,         I pond er ed w h et h er there m ig ht            not be

a nother       entrance          to the t e r r a c e d se c ti o n a nd a c c o r d i n g l y    r e tr ea te d

down the        passage,          t urning     left    past the      refreship^nt kiosk.             I t he n saw

that    there was an o pening                  to the terraces            by^the    corner       flat,    close to

the P olice         control         box,   which      I had seei/on         previous     visits       to the

ground.        A g ai n    it proved        impossible       to break       into the      crowd b e ca us e of

the throng and              I think        play was       h alted as      I approached       this     s ection.I

then s tayed          in this        pos it io n until 3.4 5 p m          (1545)    to 3. 5 0 p m    (1550),

at w hi ch      point there was              increasing        rumour      that    the game had been

abandoned.          During        these 45 m in ut es        I saw perhaps          10 to    15 people,            many

either     caused by physical             or emotional             trauma.       I was able        to see      part

of the    pitch and saw the frantic att e mp t s                      to r e su sc it at e        one fan by

the side        touch-line.      O n ly at this          point      did the thought             s trike me that

people might         by dying.     O dd     comments        from fans         later     led me to think

that a few people m ay have died                    in a crush,            s o me wh er e    on the terraces.

At 3. 4 5 p m    (1545)    I m o ve d out of the g ro un d as                 it was a p p a r e n t     that the

s t ad i u m was   being    emptied,        I took up p os i ti o n 50 yards a lo ng L e pp i n g s

faced,    about 4.30pm          (1630).        He of, course had not k no wn that                     I had held

back   from entering           the terra^is.           D ur in g   this     period      I w i t n e s s e d most

of the fans        exiting      froffiy^oth stands and terraces.                      P eo pl e    f il ed    past

possible        for having      been     r esponsibl e       for     causing       people to be

quarters     of a mile away.

On the way to the ground                   I/saw a lot of               police        officers about.            I also

turnstiles where         1 was        going          to go     in were about 6 people                  deep.      1 had

no    problems      finding where            I was going            to go       in and    I did not have any

problems     getting     in to the ground.                       I went        through a turnstile              and

handed my ticket         in.        I saw       p    o 1 i c:e officers         outside       the turnstiles           and

walls    to get      in and     I did/not             see any gates             other than the turnstiles.

Whe n    I left the     coach       Xp    walk        to the ground,,            that was       the    last     time    I

Once     inside     the gros/d        1 knew where               I was        going,     (I have been before

on a number         of occasions).                  I was    not aware                any signs directing

I    did not see anyone           drunk        in the ground.!/ I did not see any

game    started      I noticed        people          c o m i n g over        the fence       from the     pens

behind the goal.         My     immediate             reaction was             that    it was a pitch

invasion.         From where        I was           sitting      in the North Stand about                  level

with the Forest         penalty area,                 I would be about                100 yards awa y          from

where     the fans were         coming over the fence.

As    I saw these      people       climb over              the fence,          they did not swarm on to

the     pitch and there was              no fighting.                I then      realised that          it must        be

something     else.

I     than saw a Police          Of fi ce r go          onto the         pi t ch and s peak           to the

referee.        The game was          stopped arid the               players went             off.

There were        still      people    coming     onto the            pitch,          some were       lying    down.

I could see          people    being     pulled up into              the West S tand from the

terraces.         1 could see fans          taking down the advert is in g                           hoardings.

Then    people were          carrying     bodians on these                   hoardings,         up to the end

where       I was.     I could see^a        /umber of people on these boards                                 that were

put on the ground by the end of the S tand where                                       I was.        Some    of them

were    covered up and some were                 not.     O bv i ou s ly a tragedy had happened

at    the     other end      and   I knew    a   number of           p e o p 1e had        died.

I e ve nt ua ll y     left    the ground at about                16.20 - 16.30 hours.                       1 left    of

my own accord and made my way back to the                                    coach.       The    coach did      not

leave Sh ef fi el d until          quite    late,       because              the two HEWITT           lads had not

come    back.

One    or two     people      tried to find out off                   passing          police     officers      if

they knew anything about                 the HEW i n      lads.              We      could not t ind out

an ything about         them and e ven tu al ly the                  coach        left.       It was     not until

the    next S at ur da y that         I knew that Carl               and lyfcholas had died,

I did not see anything at the m at ch that                              I /c on sidered a criminal

The incident was handled very badly by/the                                    police      from the       start.

There was       too much emphasis           on cVnt      r J l   .      Host         of the     police      officers

that were       used across        the    pitch    cii^Ld have                been much better              employed

at the L ep pings Ln end of the ground.                          Afte         /   the match,         outside,     there

was a       lot of Hos ti li ty between fans and                      '/ o   1 ice

I think       that  the d i s t r i b u t i on of 1 i c o k e y s was wrong.                    it seemed      to be a

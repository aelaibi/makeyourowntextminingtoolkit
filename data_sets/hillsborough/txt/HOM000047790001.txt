                                                            Our reference:

                                                            Date:             November 1997




 am writing further to your interview with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith here on Friday 24
October.

During that interview you discussed with the Judge the statement you had written
immediately after the Hillsborough disaster and the alterations which it was suggested you
might make to it. You told the Judge that you refused to sign the altered version of your
statement (see the transcript of your interview with him, page 3 lines 30/31).

Since your interview here we have been looking through the police archives. We have found
a typed-up copy of the revised version of your statement with what appears to be your
signature at the bottom. I attach a copy of this.

We would be grateful for your comments.

A    number       of        fans     had     cans       of    beer        and      were       asked        to    finish          it     b e f or e

was also full of drunken,                         blood covered fans and a bo u t five o f f ic e rs just to

keep     tâ€˜     peace.              The     atmo sp he r e      was        very    volatile.             T he re     were       about        12

and    sit him down.                 He sp raye d blood in my face as he s h ou t ed and swore.                                             The

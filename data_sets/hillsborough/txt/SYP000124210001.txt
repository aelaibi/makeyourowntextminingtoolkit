 IF YES, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NOT EXCESSIVE AT THE TIME I ENTERED,             THE CENTRE PENS WERE VERY CROWDED

 I WOULD SAY NORMAL FOR AN HOUR ON FROM THE TIME WE ENTERED.

                        __________________ /ADDRESS NOT KNOWN)

 Q 42

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT

 AT THE TIME OF TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NO, THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ON THE TERRACES WAS UNUSUAL THOUGH,

 AT 1.50 <1350) THE CENTRE AREAS WERE VIRTUALLY FULL TO CAPACITY


Q15

 <343

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?                   >              -        ^             ^

 THERE WAS A GRADUAL BUILD UP AND AT ABOUT I             501?M <1450) THERE WAS A

 MASSIVE SURGE DURING WHICH I WAS PUSHED QUITE vIOLENTLY SIDEWARDS
                                                                                 PAGE

 G44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,    IF SO, CAN YOU SAY

 WHAT TIME THIS HAPPENED?

 AS I ’VE SAID, WITH THE SURGE   I WAS PUSHED SIDEWARDS,    I D O N ’T BELIEVE WE WERE

 REALLY SUBJECTED TO AN UNDUE CRUSH, DUE TO WHERE WE WERE STOOD,

 G43                    ^   .
                       . o n
 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CRCWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

 CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 YES.   IT WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED'®* A HASS OF PEOPLE COMING OUT OF THE

 TUNNEL BUT AT THE TIME
_



 Q4&

 NO.

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO.

 G4S

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,      IF SO BRIE F L Y EXPLAIN,

 N ^ WE ASSISTED IN GETTING PEOPLE FROM THE TERRACE UP INTO THE WEST

 STAND BUT I D O N ’T THINK ANY OF THOSE WERE INJURED.


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOb\CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO A n V v PERSON?   ^                              JjL .

 OTHER THAN THE CHAOS CAUSED BY THE PQOrS^RgKnISATION OF THE POLICE AND

 GROUND STAFF AND COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE SAME, ALSO THE SIDE FENCING FORCED

 PEOPLE INTO THE CENTRE WITH NO SIDE EXITS ALSO THE EXITS TO THE FRONT OF THE

 TERRACE WERE POOR.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 3.30PM   (1530)

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF OUR OWN ACCORD, WE'D SEEN ENOUGH.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?



 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS O&NQBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E ^ N ^ ^ ^                       C   O   M   M        I   T

 AGAIN THE POLICE SEEMED TOTALLY i h ^ R G A N I S E D WITH NO LEADERSHIP,       IT

 APPEARED THAT LARGE NUMBERS OF OFFICERS D I D N ’T REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

 REACTING MORE AS IF IT WAS A DISORDER SITUATION RATHER 1 HAN A DISASTER.

 THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS TO INFORM THE CROWD OF THE PROBLEM, A SIMPLE

 TANNOY MESSAGE AND USE OF ADVERTISING BOARD COULD HAVE! STOPPED ALL THE! CHAN IS

 F0M   THE OPPOSITION SUPPORTERS,    ORGANISED MEDICAL ATTENTION SEEMED

 SLOW IN COMING.    I SAW ONE AMBULANCE ENTER THE GROUND AT THE SPION KOP END AND

 JUST PARKED IT SEEMED FOR 5 MINUTES I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND THE DELAY.


G19

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE MAIN THINGS ARE THAT THE POLICE D I D N ’T SEEM ORGANISED,      THEIR

 COMMUNICATION APPEARED POOR, THIS SHOULD BE EXAMINED AND IMPROVED.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANY MORE STEWARDS PRESENT AND THESE SHOULD BE

 PROPERLY ORGANISED AND TRAINED,    THE DIRECTIONS OUTSIDE AND INSIDE HILLSBOROUGH

 WERE VERY POOR, SIGNPOSTING SHOULD BE VERY CLEAR AND EASILY VISIBLE TO THE

 CROWD AT THE TURNSTILES AND ON ENTRY TO THE GROUND,     ON THIS OCCASION I SAW NO

 SIGNPOSTS TO DIRECT FANS TO THE SIDE TERRACING,     MORE MEDICAL FACILITIES

 SHOULD BE AVAILABLE AT LARGE SPORTING EVENTS WITH EXPERTS PRESENT TO UTILISE

 THEM,

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT

 Q52

 D ^ YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 EXCEPT THAT THE FANS ON LEAVING WERE VERY ANGRY, BOTH IN THE STANDS AND

 IN THE STREETS.      FANS WERE SPITTING ON POLICE OFFICERS ON THE WAY BACK TO

 THE STATION.      I THOUGHT THE POLICE WERE VERY RESTRAINED THEN.     THE MORE

 SENSIBLE SUPPORTERS WERE TRYING TO PREVENT THE POLICE BEING ABUSED.

 IT WAS CLOSE TO A RIOT AT ONE STAGE.


Q19

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AijjjpiR THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT LOOKED CHAOTIC,    I D O N ’T THINK THE POLICE ON THE PITCH KNEW WHAT WAS

 GOING ON AT FIRST.      THEY FORMED A LINE IN THE CENTRE WHICH WAS POINTLESS.

 THEY MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE

 THAT.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 BAD TICKET ALLOCATION,    BAD ORGANISATION,   LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD SPION

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWE-5 OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 THE MAIN PROBLEM WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION TO THE FANS OR POLICE.            THE

 POLICE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THE PEOPLE IN THE FRONT ROW
                                -V
 SEATS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MOVED IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE TO SAFETY.  WE WERE

 PULLING PEOPLE UP, BUT WERE UNABLE Tu\GET THEM IN THE STANDS BECAUSE PEOPLE

 WOULD NOT MOVE FROM THEIR SEATS.       WE WERfeyTRYING TO MOVE PEOPLE BACK FROM

 THEIR SEATS BUT THEY TOOK NO NOTICE OF US. N^iERff WERE ABOUT TEN POLICE

 (frlCERS WHO WERE IN THE STANDS WHO COULD HAVE USED THEIR POWER TO MOVE

 PEOPLE BACK BUT WERE MORE INTERESTED IN TWO SPECTATORS WHO WERE ARGUING

 IN THE STANDS.      THEY WEREN'T INTERESTED IN THE INJURED SITUATION.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
 •1) POLICE APPEARED TO PRESUME BECAUSE       IT WAS LIVERPOOL IT WASCROWD TROUBLE.

 THEY LOOKED FOR FIGHTING WHEN IN FACT        THE MAJORITY OF LIVERPOOLFANS ARE       WELL

 BEHAVED AND ONLY A M I N O R I T Y CAUSE TROUBLE.

 2) THERE IS A NEED FOR SOME FORM OF FENCING BETWEEN TERRACE AND PITCH, BUT

 THERE SHOULD BE NO FENCING FORMING PENS AS IF THERE IS A CRUSH IN A PEN THERE

 IS NO ROOM TO EASE IT SIDEWARDS WITH FENCING PRESENT.

 3) THE ESCAPE GATES WERE TOO FEW AND TOO SMALL FROM THE PENS.

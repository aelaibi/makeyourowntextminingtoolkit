           The above lad has not spoken about the incident since the day of the disaster.
  He was not physically injured, after watching the incident from the West Stand,


                       After telling us very briefly what happened he became very upset,
  after a request from him and his father the interview was concluded. He does not wish
  to be contacted again.

           STATEMENT BY MR R HADFIELD


           On Saturday, 15 April 198$, I attended the football fixture
           at Hillsborough involving Nottingham Forest Football Club end
           Liverpool.   1 was off duty, in plain clothes, and was
           accompanied by my eon who is aged 2^ and two colleagues.

           We travelled to Sheffield by private car which I parked near
           to Hammerton Road Police Station.     We walked from there to
           the football ground and at about 2.20 pm walked by the
           Leppings Lan© Stand from the western end towards the side of
           the ground allocated to the Nottingham supporters.          I
           therefore walked by the turnstiles where subsequently a
           disaster took place.    At about £.13 pm the road leading to
           the turnstiles was very crowded indeed, and there were
           mounted officers amongst the crowds trying to get to the
           turnstilea.    X would describe the scene as very crowded and
           congested but this, in itself, did not cause me any alarm.
           What did strike me however is that on the periphery of that
           congested area were hundreds of supporters who X would
           describe as boisterous. There were certainly some who were
            worse for drink. It was also very noticeable that there were
            many people who had no tickets and I was asked on at least a
            dozen occasion® if I had any tickets fo» sa3e. 1 did not get
            the impression that the officers at the turnstiles entrance
            were unable to control the entrance, although it was very
            apparent that there was dense congestion. I walked alongside
            the river down to the main road and turned left towards the
            aide of the ground allocated to the Nottingham Forest
            supporters.    I made my way through the entrance into the
            South Stand, Gangway 5. Bow Y. I reached my seat, which was
            at the very back of the stand,'at about 2.35 pm.

            I immediately noticed that the Liverpool supporters in the
            Leppings   Lane Stand were extremely dense and        crowded
            immediately behind the goal. This was made more noticeably
            so as the two extremities of that stand were relatively quiet
            and there were certainly ope* spaces and it was very apparent
            that the crowd needed to be dispersed more in that stand,

            As it neared 3*00 pm 1 was conscious that some spectators
            from the ce^t^e part of the Leppings Lane Stand were being
            bodily lifted into the air and into the seated stand above
            them.   My first impression was that these people were
            unlawfully gaining access to the seated area. It was equally
            apparent, however, that the area from which they were
            escaping was extremely tightly packed and that the side areas
            which I referred to earlier had by then filled.

            The game commenced at 3 *00 pm but I found that my attention
            was still drawn to that stand where it was obvious that there
            was a problem and I noticed that police officers were
            beginning to stand on the perimeter wall facing the crowd ftftd
            spectators were trying to climb over the barrier fence. It
            was very clear, even from where I was, that this action was
            not motivated by either fighting or an attempt at a pitch

                         invasion. X say this because in my experience the behaviour
                         of the crowd around would have been different. Suddenly the
                         area at the back of the goal wag filled with spectators and
                         police and I assume that it was at that point that a gate had
                         been opened and there was an immediate incursion on to the
                         playing area which, again, was quite apparently not a
                         deliberate pitch invasion and X saw a senior officer run
                         toward* the centre of the field and gain the attention of the
                         referee. The gam© ended and the pitch incursion increased.
                         At no time did 1 feel that this was a pitch invasion or an
                         attempt by    Liverpool   supporters to stop the game or
                         antagonise the Nottingham supporters or even fight amongst
                         themselves.   From that point onwards it was difficult to
                         maintain a clear view of what had taken place behind the
                         goal. My seat was approximately 50 yards from the scene and
                          there quickly became so many people involved and police
                         officers that it was difficult to see any detail.

                          There followed a period of twenty minutes or so when the
                          pitch incursion grew and it was obvious that some people had
                          been injured.    There were undoubtedly some spectators who
                          were behaving in a disorderly manner and one particular
                          individual gained the attention of the entire stadium by
                          approaching the opposite end of the ground and gesticulating
                          at the crowd.     He was arrested and that arrest caused
                          spontaneous applause from the crowd.

                          I feel I can add little further in terms of individual
                          conduct which will not be adequately described in the
                          television photographs which were taken. I have considerable
                          experience in handling football crowds having served earlier
                          in Greater Manchester and policed the First Division grounds
                          in that area, and having been the Assistant Chief Constable
                          (Operations) in Derbyshire and policed matches there which
                          have been the subject of Football League Inquiries due to
                          crowd disorder involvingclubs 11 ko Chelsea and Leeds. I
                          would not wish to comment on the manner in which the policing
                          arrangements unfolded as I have insufficient knowledge of
                          what was being transmitted as information to those on duty,
                          save to make the following general observations;

                              1.       In a very short period of time there were ample police
                                        officers on the playing area      to deal with any
                                        incidents which may have unfolded.      I would assume
                                        their number to have been well in excess of 200.     A
                                        considerable amount of their effort was        clearly
                                        centred upon preventing the pitch incursion moving
                                        towards the Nottingham end. On at least two occasions
                                        they prevented small waves of supporters so doing.

                              2.       I left the ground, as it was apparent there had been a
                                        serious incident, at about 3.30 pm.     I particularly
                                        felt that some form of public announcement should have
                                        been made. There nay be factors which prevented this
                                        but the Nottingham supporters Immediately close to ®e
                                        were incensed by what they clearly interpreted as a
                                        pitch invasion and some form of information to them
                                        would have altered the temperature of the remaining
                                        spectators who were not involved.

                              3-            In terms of   the allocation of sections of the ground
                                            to the two    Clubs, I feel that it wets correct in

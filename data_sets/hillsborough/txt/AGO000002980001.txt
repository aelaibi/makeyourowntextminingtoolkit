HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


You will re c all t h a t a t th e pre-inquiry m e e tin g on April 28th Lord Justice Taylor
indicated t h a t any body a g a in s t whom any alleg atio n was to be m ade would be informed
of it a id th e su b sta n c e o f th e evidence supporting it.

You will a p p re c ia te t h a t t h e task of assem bling the evidence for the Inquiry is a
formidable one. And s t a t e m e n t s a re still being taken. However, it seem ed right to let
you have w hat m u st be a p relim in ary indication of c riticism s-w h ich may be levelled at
th e South Yorkshire Police as soon as possible before th e c o m m e n ce m e n t of the
Inquiry.   We su sp e c t t h a t you a re a lre ad y a w are of th e gen eral th ru s t of criticism s
which have been m a d e and t h a t what is s e t o ut in this l e t te r will be no surprise to you.

The following a re th e m ain g e n e ra l c ritic ism s which so far appear from the evidence
available t o us:-

1,       Failure to ta k e any a d e q u a te s te p s to control supporters so th a t th e crush, which
         built up fro m a b o u t 2.20 to 2.30pm outside the Leppings Lane e n tra n c e to the
         ground and w hich led to the decision to open ' C g a te because o f a perceived
         danger to life, d id n ot o ccu r. In p a rtic u la r, th e re w ere not proper arrangem ents
         to ch eck s u p p o rte rs a t a far enough distance from th e ground and insufficient
         o ffice rs w e re a v a ila b le to c o n tro l th e crowd outside the tu rn stile s.    Having
         regard to th e lim ite d s p ac e available, th e disposition of mounted police may not
         have been o f any use and may h ave c o n stitu te d a positive danger. It should
         have been a n tic ip a t e d th a t many supporters would a rriv e shortly b efore kick-off
         and th a t som e would n o t have tic k e ts. Steps should have been tak en to stop
         n o n -tick e t h o ld ers g e ttin g n ear th e ground and adding to the congestion.

                                                                                                               P. 10




 2.    Failure by o ff ic e rs outside to liaise adequately with those inside the ground and
       vice v e rsa . T h e re w ere in addition problems with radio com m unications and the
       noise of th e crow d re n d e re d such tannoy or loudspeaker announcem ents (if any)
       as w ere m ad e in e ffe c tiv e . When it was decided th a t a g a t e or g ates m ust be
       o p e n e d to re lie v e pressure outside (and the decision to open g a te s may well have
       been a n e c e s s a ry one in th e circum stances), th e re w ere no s te p s tak en to ensure
       th a t th e r e was a n y police o r stew ard presence to p rev en t those en tering going to
       The tunnel which led onto the already overcrowded Pens 3 and h. it ought *o
       have been re a lise d th a t w ithout such presence all those com ing in the gates
       w ere likely to go down th e tunnel because of inadequacy o f signing ar.d because
       the tunnel was th e only visible way to the terracing.

 3.    No step s w e re ta k e n to monitor properly the s ta te of Pens 3 and             Officers
       ought to h a v e b e e n s tatio n ed in the tunnel and/or a t the re a r of the pens and
       should in co n ju n c tio n w ith those a t the front have ensured t h a t th e pens did not
       b ecom e to o full. It was known th a t th e re was likely to be a full house and that
       it was e s s e n tia l to ensure an even distribution of s p e c ta to rs in all the pens on
       th e te r r a c e s , p a rtic u la rly as the decision had been m ade to give Liverpool the
       sm aller end o f th e ground.

 4.    When p e o p le b eg an to be crushed and to lose th e ir lives, th e o ffic e rs Vi front of
       Pens 3 and i took too long to r e a c t to what was happening. They seem ed to be
       thinking in te r m s o f prevention of disorder and pitch invasion r a th e r than safety.
       There w as no pro p er guidance given to the individual o ffic e rs because no proper
       plans had b een m ad e to d eal with overcrowding in th e pens. The gates leading
       on to th e p itc h w ere not opened in tim e and, when they w ere, officers were
       initially try in g to prevent people g ettin g out. O ffice rs seem ed not to know what
       they should do and, although many individual o ffice rs showed g re a t presence of
       mind and d ev o tio n to duty, valuable minutes went by b efo re the nature of what
       was happening w a s a p p re cia te d .

 5.    There w e r e in a d e q u ate contingency plans to deal with th e sort of emergency
       which a ro s e . In p a rtic u la r, the em ergency services may not have been called as
       ex p ed itio u sly a s they should have been and insufficient a rra n g e m en ts had been
       made to e n a b le th em to gain a ccess to the ground, b e lp for th e injured was not
       c o -o rd in a te d a n d no use was m ade of the tannoy system to explain to spectators
       w h at had happened or to organise assistance.

 6.    Since th e r e was no ch an c e th a t all those trying to e n te r the ground would be
       ab le to do so by 3pm, consideration should have been given to deferring the
       k ick-off a t a m uch e a r lie r stag e. It seem s th a t it was n o t until about 2.55 that
        this s t e p w a s co n sid ered and by then it was thought to be too la te because the
        te a m s w e re        com ing o u t.        It should have been c lear much e arlie r th a t the
        k i c k - o f f m u s t b e p o s tp o n e d a n d t h a t a d e q u a t e s t e p s w e r e t a k e n to give
        assu ra n ce to th o se trying to g e t in t h a t there was a p o stp o n em en t. This might
        h a v e r e l i e v e d t h e p r e s s u r e a n d o b v i a t e d t h e n e e d to o p e n t h e g a te s .
                                                                                          *
 Should any f u r t h e r sp ecific m a tte r s which might resu lt in c ritic ism s come to our
 a tte n tio n , we shall of co urse le t you know of them.

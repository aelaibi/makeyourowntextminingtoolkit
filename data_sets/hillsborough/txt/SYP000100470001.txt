DETECTIVE INSPECTOR




FORCE HEADQUARTERS - CID




I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police and am in charge

of the Force Serious Crime Squad.

On I believe          the 8 April       1989.    I received a telephone            call at my home

asking     if    I was     available      to perform     duty     at    the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Ground on the occasion of the FA Cup Semi Final the following

Saturday        15    April    1989.      It     subsequently     transpired        that    Inspector

Brennan     of       rC r Division      had been    deputed     but    he   for    some    reason    was

unavailable.

I agreed to work and at 9-^5 a.m. on Saturday 15 April 1989. I attended

the North Stand of the football ground where I took charge of Serials 39

and 40 and was briefed by the senior officers present.                              I then allowed

both serials to eat their packed meals,                    and then briefed them myself as

to   our    particular         duties    which     involved     the    reception     of    coaches    on

Halifax Road.           I made my w ay to         Halifax Road        near to Chaucer School and

deployed one serial             to actually       receive the         coaches and another spread

out along that road back towards the ground to ensure where possible that

the Liverpool supporters remained in the coaches until they were parked.

We were not           particularly busy until           about 2.00 p.m.           when many coaches

began to        arrive    as    a result of       the   first reception area being filled.

This was situated at Claywheels Lane.

We gradually, as coaches arrived, worked our way down Halifax Road closer

to the ground and there were no difficulties experienced, the supporters
                                                  -    2   -




appeared to be in good spirits and few of the coach passengers appeared

to have been drinking.                 Other supporters who had arrived by private car

and vans also walked past us and a number of these appeared to have been

drinking        but    except    for    the    odd     word       of       advice,    no   other     action     was

necessary.

As   the    time       moved     towards       kick        off,        I    could     hear     radio      messages

reflecting difficulties in the control of the crowd at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles and I could understand such difficulties as I have previously

been on duty at that location years ago and on big occasions arranging

orderly queues of supporters who are inclined to arrive near to kick off

time is a problem.               I gathered the units together and walked the short

distance to the junction of the main road with Claywheels Lane.                                           My radio

had not been working particularly well and I listened in to my Sergeant’s

radio.      We were supposed to return to the traffic garage for meal but a

message     was       received    that        all ’ available              officers    were     to   go    to   the

ground.         I walked with my units together with a number of others along

Leppings Lane and on reaching the turnstiles I saw a number of Policemen

lined up,        but    few supporters.               I did not understand what was happening

and the radio was a succession of unintelligible messages.                                           I told both

my Sergeants to gather their serials together and I went to try and find

out what was happening.                  I walked towards                  the service road and to the

right      of    the    turnstiles       and     saw       an   ambulance.             There    were      officers

rendering first aid to two people lying on the ground and I could hear

supporters        shouting       that    it     was        my   fault        and     similar    comments        were

directed at other officers around m e .                           I ran through a gate and down the

tunnel that leads to the area behind the Leppings Lane goal.                                         I wanted to

know what was happening and I saw people milling about in front of m e .                                           I
                                              -    3   -




don't know how but I went                forward onto the running track and saw               people

lying on the ground and a parked ambulance                        with two persons inside.        I

was    stood    at    a   door   to   the   terracing         and I then     started   shouting   at

officers round me to lift fans who were being carried towards me from the

terracing to help me lift them out of the crowd.                           I helped both injured

and uninjured fans off the terracing and told officers to lift them away

from the track to allow others through.                        I don't know how long this went

on but I began to realise that to my left was a heap of injured.                               I was

shouting       at    officers near to me to carry                 the    injured   away and   render

first aid.           I then heard        someone saying         'This o n e ’s alive' and     it was

then I thought            there may be fatalities but I couldn't accept                   that the

people I was struggling to lift out were dead.

There were supporters on the terracing throwing articles towards us and

they were       shouting       threats    at me.           I couldn't understand why and kept

thinking what         are   they blaming me for,              I just couldn't grasp what was

happening.          I lifted what seemed a lot of people out and at some stage I

saw a body of a young man being passed to m e .                          He was purple and as we

lifted him he hit his head on top of the wall.                          I shouted 'mind his head'

or something and then thought, he's dead you idiot,                           get him out of the

way.    I was still telling officers to assist the injured as I moved away

from what had now become                 the exit      from the terracing and I encouraged

fans and police officers               to rip the wire netting away from the area of

the exit to allow more room.

How long I carried the bodies I do not know but eventually the area in

front of me cleared and I had chance to look round at the playing area

immediately behind me.                Thinking about it now I presume that all except

for two that I lifted out were dead.                        Those two showed signs of life but

the others          did not.      Some    of the people we had laid on the                grass had
their* faces covered and were              obviously dead but I couldn't accept that

and wanted to help them.

I eventually      accepted        that    I was    surrounded with dead people and that

there was nothing I could do.               I completely lost track of time and cannot

even guess     how long I was            involved in what I have                described.        I would

estimate I entered the terracing between 3-10 p.m. and 3-15 p.m.                                    I then

wanted the injured and bodies removing and tried to ask on the radio for

ambulances      but    the    radio       was   just     a    succession         of    messages.         In

retrospect     I don't know         if I actually tried to                 get    through       or if the

radio was so jammed that it was impossible.

I was finding it difficult to accept that these people had to lay there

and was angry that no ambulances had been sent to us.                              The one ambulance

that was there moved away from the area behind the goal and I could then

see many more dead and injured on the other side of the goal area.

The next thing I recollect is supporters running up to me and telling me

again   that    it     was   my    fault    and     some     wanting       to    fight    me.      One    in

particular was dragged             away    from me       by his friends.              I was     angry    and

frustrated      that    I    couldn't      do   anything         to help   people        and    found     it

difficult to keep my temper.               I tried to calm down            some Police Constables

who   were     also    feeling      the    same    way     and     then, for      some     reason,       the

Liverpool      supporters         began    to     charge     towards       the    Nottingham        Forest

supporters on the Spion Kop.                I started to form a line across the centre

of the pitch and as I was doing so a Superintendent came to me and said

something like "Get a lirie of officers, keep them apart".                                 I said I was

doing that and continued to do so.                     I was joined at around this time or

just before by Detective Sergeant Morton who was working in uniform and

stayed with me.

Myself and others eventually formed the line and I must admit that the
prospect of a riot in front of the Spion Kop frightened me.                                      I shouted at

officers to keep the line intact and then met Chief Superintendent Nesbit

who told me         to get    a line      of police       dogs      in   front        of    the    Spion    Kop.

Detective Sergeant Morton used his radio to ask for the police dogs and

they    were very quickly in position.                   This made me feelmuch better as I

felt    that we were now            to some degree            atany rate controlling                 what was

happening.          There were      several   incidents of disorder around the police

line and I remember supplementing one end near to the players tunnel with

officers that were stood behind the line.

People young and old were coming up to me enquiring as to missing friends

and asking if people were really dead.                         I lied to them.              I said I didn't

know    and       that   although    I knew   therewere         injured,         I         was    not sure    if

anyone was dead.           I was still finding the acceptance of the deaths almost

impossible on a personal basis and that is why I lied to them.                                        A young

boy, probably eleven years of age, came up to us and asked if any young

people had been hurt.               I said I didn't know and he said that his friend

was missing and that it was his fault because he had insisted he came to

the match.         I almost broke down at this stage but managed to reassure him

as best I could, helped by Detective Sergeant Morton, and he walked back

towards the Leppings Lane terracing.

This period of time is impossible to estimate but I kept enquiring if the

match had been cancelled.                 I felt very strongly that it should have been

and     I    put    this    point    of    view     to    a    number       of       senior      officers    who

approached me.             Eventually      this decision was made                    and I took half the

line    of    officers      from    the    centre    of       the   pitch    to       the     Penistone     Road

junction with Herries Road to supervise the Nottingham supporters as they

left.        Detective Sergeant Morton remained with me for communication and

there       was    a uniform Chief Inspector there but I c a n ’t remember who it
I   was   engaged       in    this    duty       for   some    time     and    when       the    Nottingham

supporters        had   cleared      the     ground     I     went    to   the     North        Stand   where

officers were gathered.

I searched for my two serials with whom I had lost contact since entering

the ground and with the help of Police Sergeant Cloke who was in charge

of serial 40, I located all but three Police Constables and the Sergeant

who was in charge of serial 3-

I talked     to    two Police        Constables        who were       part    of    serial       39 who had

obviously    been       present      at    the    incident      and    asked       them   to write       down

briefly what       they had seen.               They went away to do that and some short

time later, after a de-brief from a senior officer in the stand, I sent

all my officers present plus the two who had by then completed statements

to Claywheels Lane for transport back to Rotherham.

I then attended a short briefing of Inspectors and above in front of the

Police Control Room by Chief Superintendents Mole and Nesbit and returned

to Police Headquarters.

I should add that I am confused as to my exact position in front of the

terracing.         I at      the   time    of    the   incident       believe      that I was lifting

people from the terracing through a gate but it may have been a hole in

the wire netting, which with my encouragement was further torn away from

its frame at some stage to enlarge the hole.

I also pulled two police officers from the terracing and one of these I

have since identified as Police Sergeant 758 Morgan,                                 ’F* Division,        who

confirms    this.       That officer left the terracing when I believe all the

dead and injured had been removed.

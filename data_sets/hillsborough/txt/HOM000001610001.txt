bottling        plant.       It would have               been about       1 c'   u    • by this' t*.T,«i.

E v e r y b o d y got     off     the      coach and I                    _ Ianc, I decided tc        go ana

find a pub to              have a couple of               pints and get something to aat              before

we went        into ths      game -        There were a lot of Liver pool                  supporters        in

the    pud     but    the a tm os p h e r e       was    really f ri endly and good.             There was

no trouble           in there.

ws    came     out    of the      pub at about S . 20 and went                to a Ohio Shop opposite

to get some fish a nd                  chips w hi ch we ate             on the way dawn to the around,

We got to H i l l s b o r o u g h at          roughly 2 .30         pm.     Last year      before wa

a c t u a l l y got to the gates              there were Police Officers                 stopping the

fans and filtering                everyone         slowly through towards the                 entrance    and

the    turnstiles,          so    that a lt h o u g h       there was      a sit uf susiiinc and

j ostling       the Police         were      in control          of the    situation.

This year we went                straight         into     the entrance      of the ground         (Leppings

On the way to the                    turnstiles              I c a n ’t remam&ar seeing any Police

the entrance                  to the tunnel            stopping        people        entering       the         Dens      f.ehind

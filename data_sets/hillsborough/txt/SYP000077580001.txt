At   that    time a large / r o / d was at the turns t i l e s                      but a g a i n there was

no trouble and             people were         enterino^%1Te~' gr o u n d         in an orderly manner.

s tood at        the t u rnstiles        I was a p p r o a c h e d by a senior Officer                    who    I did

not know,          he orde r e d me      to start          encouraging       the    supporters       stood

round     to make        their way       into       the turnstiles.          I a p p r o a c h e d a group of

about     forty suppo r t e r s         stood across          the    road from me,         I began taking

cans    of beer         from them a n d throwing              them    into the       side of the           road,       1

kept as king           them to make          their way       into the       grounds,     saying      things

such as      "Come       on lads,       lets    have y o u        inside,    we    c a n ’t all    be getting

in at the          last m i n u te ."    I went       behind them and began

e n c ourag i ng them to           cross      the    road to the         turnst i1e s , some        di d faut

others      simply       split     from the         group and began walking              in different

directio ns.           I c o n tinued    talking          to other    groups and asking             them 'to

enter    the       ground    in a similar            manner.      Some    did as     requested       but

others a g a i n d i sp er se d along               the    In. At this       time    I saw        o mourited

and simply w a lk ed a r o u n d the Police                    horses and as            fast as the

m o u n t e d were    clearing          the wall       the suppo r t e r s were           going     behind them

and a g a i n s t a nding a l on gs id e          the bridge wall.

T hr ou g h o u t   this    time    traffic was             still    trying       to get thro u g h L e p pings

Ln and was h i n d er ed           by fans       still       a r r i vi ng and walking           in the       roadway,

I therefore          began    clearing          fans    off    of the       ro^to         allow the          traffic

through.       More     farts wer e a r r i vi ng and thi^r'oegan to                      prove an          impossible

task.     I heard a no t h e r          Officer     nearb^ / t h a t       the    road was       being       closed to

traffic: and we were               to    let the       suppo r t e r s     have the       roadway. I

t h e refore went          back    to the f r ^ t           of the    turnstiles.           At that         time    I was

approached          by In s p e c t o r SYKJES,        he was a c c o m p a n i e d by a young man

pushing another             young m a r /i n a w heelchair,                 he a sked me         to try and

clear a way t hr o u g h the/edge                 of the       crowd for          the w h e e l c h a i r    and; get

a l l o w e d us access       to the       gate     in a very good h u m o u r e d manner.                    The    gate

was    op e n e d on our      request and           the w he el c h a i r        was a l l o w e d through

before       it was a g a in       closed.       I then turned ajnd started to make rny way

back     to the      roadway and the             rear of t h e ^ r o w d .

At    this    time    the whole          mood    of the       crowsi—a p p e a r e d    to change           in an

was    impossible          to do so.'

After     only a few m in u t e s          several          Police    horses were           ridden      into the

                   being     ridden by a Police                 Inspector,      I co n t i n u a l l y    tried to       push    people

                   i m m e di a t e ly    in front       of me.      We must    have     relieved         the   pressure        from

                   the     crowd for a short while                   because    I was     then grabbed from behind and

                   t u r n ed a r o u nd    by a man who was             in the       crowd    nearest      to the       turnstiles.

                   He was       o bv io u s l y very d i s tr es se d and was            very abusive           and aggressive,

                   it was       obvious      that       his a g g r e s s i o n was    not from anger           but from fear

                   and     panic,        he was    shouting       that    people were          going      to be killed and

                   that     he had been at Heysel                 and the same was             going      to happen again.             He

                   got     hold of both my arms                and was       shaking me        shouting,        "For     fuck    sake

                   do something,            do something,            people are        going    to be killed."              I tried to

                   e x p l a i n to him that we were                 doing all        that we      could but he would               not

                   listen.       I e ve n t u a l l y    told him that         if he did not             calm down and stop

                   s w e aring     I w ou l d have         to arrest      him as he was winding                 up other        people

                   a r o u n d us. As       I was       saying    this    to him we were a p p r o a c h e d           by another

                   man,     he said that          he was        this m a n ’s so l i c i t o r and that           the man had

                   look after            the m a n who was upset and he took                    him away from me.               The man

                   years     of age,        he had a m o p of untidy dark hair                       that fell      f o r w a r d onto

 gone and only a small                      number       of     people were            left milling around.

 As     I began to           come    round and           regain my         composure a mess a g e               came        over

fence w ith m o u th to m ou th                    and heart m a s s a g e , I went over                  to them and

knelt       down at        the side         of     the boy to try and assist them,                       as    I did so

I felt       blows        to the back of my head and shoulders,                           I turned        round          and

two men were              lashing       out at me,           I tried     to    restrain them and was

assisted          by other       supp o r t e r s and Police Officers.                    We tried to get                them

to    leave       the     pitch but they w ould                 not.    I saw that        the    small     gate No.            1

to my       left had a ga in been opened and more                             people were        coming       onto       the

pitch.       Small        pockets      of fight i.ng and              puf/hi ng wer e break i ng out and                  so

in order          to prevent a ny m o r e           people ^forcing onto the               pitch and adding                  to

the    confusion           I went      back        to g§#e          one and     closed     it once        again.         1

remained at the gate                   to    preycnt an y o n e         else    opening         it

were       co n t i n u a l l y t rying wtiT cl imb over               the    barrier and        push thro u g h the

gate,        there was          plenty of          room       inside    that    part    of the stand and so                    1

b e ga n p u s h i ng t hem ba c k over              the       rail i n g s a n d wa s a s s i s t e d    by other

s up p o r t e r s    in the     stand who were                pulling       them back and trying              to    calm

them       down.      I   became the subject                 of verbal        abuse and spitting              from

these       people        but    to have let them onto                 the     pitch w o u l d have       led to

more       confusion.         I did     let onto the              field an y o n e who       said that         they

         were medical            staff and offering a ssistance.                         It a p p e a r e d to me that            the

         decent      people       in the      crowd were           realising         the    scale of what            had    been

         t aking     place and         r e m ained      in the      stand,        the    ones who were           trying      to

         get    onto      the    pitch were          the      people who were            drunk and for some                unknown

         r eason w a n t e d to be          part      of what was             happening.

         Throughout         this     time     I could see more                 peop^l^Seing          pulled over           the

         fence     and onto        the     pi^tcj?^The N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t             fans    did not appear            to

         know what was            hap p e n i n g    or a p p r e c i a t e    the grav i t y of the situation,

         I could       clearly hear           them      chanting,         "Let      ’em die,        let     'em die,       let

         'em die." and this                o b v i o u sl y    incensed        the L i verpool           suppo r t e r s who

         c o n ti n u e d shoving         f or w a r d and then began throwing                      coins at        people on

         the    pitch who were             trying       to help.        E v e r y o n e was       very emotional           and

         upset     but     I c o u 1d not        u n d er st an d this         b e h a v i o u r . The young        boy who had

         dark    hair and a full              b eard was         o b v i o u s l y dead.      A few minutes            later,

         two young         girls     from the St.             Johns A m b u l a n c e were at his side and

         trying      to    revive      hirn, they were            upset        them s e l v e s    and    it was     obvious

         that    they were wast ing                  thei r t i m e .

         I t ried to go a n d help                   them and to tell them                 so,    but every         time 1. left

         E v e n t u a l l y anot h e r    man       came over to the two               girls and took              them away

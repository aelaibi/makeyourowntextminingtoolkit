        R. M. Whalley Esq.
        Secretary to the Enquiry into the
          Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
        30 Queen Annes Gate
        London SW1H 9AT

        Dear Mr Whalley,

        The Royal Association deeply regrets the tragic events which made your
        enquiry necessary.   It is obviously important that all aspects of safety
        are covered but the Royal Association is anxious to ensure that no
        measures are proposed which prevent disabled people from making full use of
        the facilities.    For many years RADAR has campaigned to' ensure disabled
        people are able to enjoy the same opportunities as others and considerable
        success has been achieved regarding access to theatres, cinemas, sports
        centres and similar buildings. Most new buildings, including sports
        stadia, must make provision for disabled people. There are no regulations
        at the moment which require access provisions to be made in existing
        buildings but if football and other stadia have extensive alterations made
        to them it does present an opportunity to make provisions for disabled
        people.

        The regulations governing new buildings are the Building Regulations 1985 -
        Access for Disabled People - Approved Document M.   This covers access
        provisions such as ramps, wide doors, the manner in which stairs should be
        designed, the provision of handrails, etc. It also recommends that where
        there is fixed audience or spectator seating six or 1/100th of the total
        seating open to the public, whichever is the greater, should be wheelchair
        spaces.   A wheelchair space means a clear space with a width of 900 mm and
        a depth of at least 1400 mm, accessible to the wheelchair user and
        providing a clear view of the event.   The space may be one which is kept
        clear or from which seating can be readily removed for the occasion.   The
        spaces should not all be together but should be dispersed among the
        remainder of the places.

        A number of football clubs do make provision for wheelchair users.  This
        may be in a reserved space under cover or it may      be    at the edge ofthe
        pitch.   Several football clubs have permitted disabled fans to drive
        invalid tricycles into the ground but as these vehicles are being phased
        out this is a solution which will be less satisfactory in the future. One
        of the advantages to disabled fans being located at the edge of the pitch
        is that they are less prone to crushing or other hazards which they may
        suffer on the terraces.   The disadvantage is that in many cases they
        do not enjoy protection from the weather. Many wheelchair users have
        circulatory problems and feel the cold.   It is therefore desirable for
        them to be offered better facilities wherever possible.

The location of many football grounds limits the provision they are able
to make for disabled supporters.   RADAR would, however, recommend that
wherever possible parking facilities should be reserved for Orange Badge
holders.   I enclose details of the Orange Badge Scheme.    It is important
for people to be able to move with ease between their car and the position
from which they will view the game and wherever possible ramps should be
installed.   These should be at a gradient of 1 :20 and certainly no
steeper than 1:10.

There has recently been some criticism of toilet facilities at football
grounds.   It is not RADAR'S task to comment on facilities for able-bodied
supporters but we believe it is important that suitable provision is made
for disabled people.   Each football club should have at least one toilet
designed for wheelchair users and which conforms to BS 5810, details of
which I enclose.

Although facilities for wheelchair users are important most disabled
people do not use wheelchairs and their needs can be met comparatively
inexpensively and in ways which will also be of benefit to other
spectators.   For example, clubs could consider painting the edge of their
steps in bright colours, so partially sighted people, and others, can
easily see where the edge of the steps are.   Appropriate provision of
hand rails would help all supporters.   Such low cost adaptations would
make a considerable improvement to the safety of people visiting soccer
grounds.

There is no single solution to the problems faced by disabled people in
gaining access to football stadia.   Each ground is different and would
require a slightly different approach.   However, it is important for
clubs to accept the principle of providing for all supporters, including
those with disabilities, and it will be possible to determine the details
of achieving this objective at a later stage.   We welcome the efforts
football clubs have made to cater for disabled spectators and hope
that the report of your enquiry will urge the clubs which have not been
so progressive to emulate those which have.

Yours sincerely,

                 The following recommendations are included in ' BS 5810:1979 British Standard Code of
                 P ractice for Access for the Disabled to Buildings' and reproduced by permission of the
                 British Standards Institution.

                 Lavatory accommodation accessible to w heelchair users should incorporate an accessible
                 WC compartment and should allow w h eelchair approach to fac ilitie s such as hand rinse
                 basins, drinking fountains, incinerators, mirrors and towel dispensers.

                The preferred fa c ility , referred to as a unisex WC fa c ility , is one which incorporates a
                WC compartment serving both sexes, allow ing , for exam ple, a husband to help a disabled
                wife or v ic e versa. The WC compartment should be equipped and have overall dimensions
                not less than those indicated ov erleaf. At least one unisex facility should be provided
                for the following:

                        a) Public lavatory accommodation in shopping centres and large department
                           stores, transport buildings such as air term inals; motorway service stations
                           and principal railw ay stations; concert h alls, theatres, cinem as, conferÂ­
                           e n ce and exhibition buildings, recreational buildings such as sport and
                           leisure centres; hospitals, health and w elfare centre buildings.

                        b) Staff lavatory accommodation in large office buildings and in buildings
                           related to other types of employment.

                In other buildings where lavatory accommodation is provided for disabled people a unisex
                WC facility is also preferred.

                WC Compartment for w heelch air users should comply with the following:

                        The door should open out or slid e , ex ce p t that an inw ard-opening side-hung
                        door is permissible where there is sufficient unobstructed space (minimum
                        1100 mm x 700 mm) inside the WC compartment for a w heelch air to be
                        positioned clear of the line of the door swing.

                        The door should be openable from outside in the event of an em ergency.
                        Support rails should be provided. Preferred locations are indicated o verleaf.
                        A hand rinse basin should be provided, where practicable, in position so that
                        it can b e used by a person seated on the WC.

                        The to ile t paper holdershould be lo cated on the side wall close to the WC seat.

                        A fixed mirror should be provided with its lower                                edge not higher than 900 mm
                        above floor le v e l.

                        The rim of the WC bowl should be a minimum height of 400 mm above floor le v e l,
                        with the seat approxim ately 450 mm above floor le v e l, to f a c ilia te transfer from

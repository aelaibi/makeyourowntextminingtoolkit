                 At    9.45       am    (0945)          on    Saturday       15 A p r i l      1989       (150489),          I paraded         at

                 Liverpool             v Nottingham             Forrest.         I was         detailed          to    work       in S e i ^ a l

                 Tango       6,    and       was    a    passenger       in F o r d         Transit' 2 8 0 W .          Our       dulfies    on     the

                 day       were    to    supervise             the    public     houses         in       the    Grenoside          area     and     to

                 patrol       the       A&1    between          Tankersley          intersection                of    the    Ml    motorway         and.

                 Hillsborough                Football          Ground.

                 We    patrolled             Grenoside          and,    from     approximtely                  11.30    am    (1130),         large

                 numbers          of    Liverpool             supporters        in a        variety        of    vehicles,           began     to

                 travel       on       the    A61.

                 We    parked          outside          the    Norfolk       Arms    at       Grenoside          on    the    A61     and    we     were

                 approached             by    numerous          Liverpool        supporters               who    were       seeking

                 directions             to    any       public       house    and    not       to    the       ground.

                                                                                                                                                     S2688

We    continued                 to    patrol             Grenoside              with       no    problems.

At    approximately                       1400       hours,           we    patrolled             the          full          length       of    t h e A.61

and,     at    this             time,          the       road        was    almost          completely                   clear       of    traffic             and

we    had     an       unobstructed                      movement           to    the       ground.

At    1430     hours,                we    parked            at      the    junction             of       Foxhill             Rd    and    Halifax             Rd,

some     1/2       mile          from          the       ground,           and,       at    this          time,          vast       numbers          of

Liverpool              supp/rters                   were       walking           down       Halifax                Rd    towards          the    ground.

Many     suppo r t / r s were                       carrying              crates       of       alcohol             with       others          carrying

cans     ofV^rfco hol                 in       their         arms         and    drinking             as       they          were    walking.

arrived        at          the       scene          at       1457     hrs       and    I saw          a    vast          number       of       fans

outside        the          ground             and       a    large        number          of    police             personnel.                 Although

there       was        a    large          crowd.              There        appeared             to       be       no    serious          problem          and

we   were      instructed                      by    POL       INS        ROBJmlSQN         to    resume                to    Claywheels             Ln    for

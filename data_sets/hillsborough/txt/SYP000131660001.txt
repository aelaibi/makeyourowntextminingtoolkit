       YOUR REF                   MJF/VSC



     Dear Mr. Foster,

     Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation

     I refer to our recent telephone conversation when we discussed
     your request for facilities to interview Graham Mackrell,
     Keith Addie and Herbert McGee.

     As I mentioned to you, Mr. McGee is no longer Chairman of
     Sheffield Wednesday and I do not believe that he will be able
     to assist in your enquiries.   He is a man of advanced years,
     and when I was investigating the matter prior to the Inquiry I
     spent a good deal of time with him in order to assess what
     evidence he was able to provide.



     Since then he has ceased to be Chairman of the Club, further
     time has passed,________________________________________________



     In the circumstances we are agreed that you should commence
     with an interview of Graham Mackrell, on a date to be fixed.
     If, following that interview, you need to see other witnesses
     we can determine what arrangements can be made at that stage
     but it may well be that the evidence and information you
     require may be provided by Mr. Mackrell in any event.

     I will be in touch with you over the telephone to see what we
     can do about agreeing a date.

     Yoprs sincerely,



     V J L'J N C J iliJ M 'J .’   U   '

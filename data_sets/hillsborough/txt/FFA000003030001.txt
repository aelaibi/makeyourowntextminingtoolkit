                             MEMORANDUM

To:     Glen Kirton (Football Association)
From:   Chris Whalley (Football League)                     5th June, 1989



                                  Kick-off times

      Jack Crawford has spoken to Greater Manchester Police to sound out
their views on kick-off times.
      They would not be in favour of a blanket move towards morning kick-offs
because they do not know what effect it would have on travelling supporters.
They are happy for matches to continue to kick-off at 3.00 p.m. knowing that
there is always flexibility for them to request an early kick-off if deemed
necessary.
      They would not be in favour of a move towards more Sunday matches, as
this would clash with    other events such as Rugby League.   It is generally
more expensive to police a match on a Sunday and no doubt there would be
complaints from local    residents and the Lord's Day Observance Society.
      ACPO have not discussed this matter in detail and it was suggested that,
should we be seriously considering a proposal for earlier kick-off times,
then we should write to ACPO and they would give the matter thorough
consideration.

           had     telephoned              ms       earlier       in the        week        and      asked       me     if I w i s h e d          to

go    to    the        match       because           there       was    the      possibility               that       ha w o u l d       be

Whilst          travelling            from N o t t i n g h a m          to S h e f f i e l d         the    train         w as      very

packed with              people,           many          of who     were       football           supporters              from

Nottingham,,                 The    train           actually        arrived          at     the      main      City       c en t r e

railway          Station           in S h e f f i e l d at          around        11,00 am            ( 1 1 00 h r s ).




As    I got        off       the    tr a in ,        along       with     other        Forest          s u p p o r t e r s we       w e r e met

appeared           to    be a s e p a r a t e             exit,     different             to    the      one     t ha t      wa s    being

used       by     the    ''Non f o o t b a l l i! fans.                 At     this       exit       we w e r e       me t     by a

corridor           or P o l i c e      Officers             approx        30    ~ 40 who             escorted           us     on      to a

special           bus    that       ha d    been          laid    on    for     football             supporters.                 Also with

us    on    the        bus    were     2 Police             Officers           who     travelled            with        us     on the

v e h i r.].e „




The    bus        stopped          outside           the    ground        on    the       Penistone            Rd N dual

carriageway              which        is    outside             the Sp.i.on K o p           terraces           at a b o u t            1 ..1b am

(1113       hrs).            The    time        t    had a r r a n g e d       to m e e t       P au l     was    at      around         1.30

pm    ( 1 330      hrs)       so    1 decided              to    have     a walk          around         and     get      something           to

eat    in the           mean       time.




As    I walked           around        a number             of    people        wh o      appeared          to    be      footaai1

supporters              were       sitting           outside        the      pubs      in      the    area       ftaving a drxriK

anyone          wh o    appeared           to       be    drunk.        The     general           overall         atmosphere

around          the     ground was              very       " e x c i t e d 11 a l m o s t      friendly,           if     1 Ha d       to

We     initially            remained           outside          the    South        Stand,         awaiting        the       players          to

Immediately ahead                      of    as w a s       a t u n n e l , at        the      end     of w h i c h         the      pitch

could       os    seen       from       the       entrance.             Also       you    could        hear         the     crowd

generally             chanting          and       singing.           We      just      presumed            that      the       t un n e l    was

the    only       sntrance             to    the     terraces.




There       were       relatively              few     people        in the          t un n e l ,    appro:-;, half              a dozen

and    we    walked          through           fairly        e a s il y .       On     reachingXhe                  end     of    the

enclosure             we w e r e       standing          in was         already          filled        to     capacity            or m o r e

than    capacity             when       the       rest      of    the     ground         that       wa s    visible            to me

appeared          empty          in    comparison.                From       the     time      1 entered             the       ground        via

the    turnstiles                until       we     took     up    our       standing          position,             I c a n ’t

remember          seeing          any Police             or S t e w a r d       control         whatsoever.




On    the    terraces,                I d i d n ’t see a n y            disorder          or    drunkeness                and     the

atmosphere             still          appeared         to    be     friendly and               good        na t u r e d .




Also    the       age       of    the       crowd      was       very mixed,             ranging           from      teenagers

through          to    retiring             age,     which        usually          signifies           that         people        behave

The     main       thin g      that       struck       me ^cith         b e f o r e a n d a f t e r the i n c i d e n t was

pm     ( 1 400     hrs)     the P e n s         were       full    to    capacity and               supporters          should

have        been      directed        to a l t e r n a t i v e       terraces         at      either       side    of

After        the m a t c h was            stopped?          I think        in the       circumstances,              everyone

fans        w o r k i ng side        by    side.           Another       thing       t ha t    struck       me    was    the    lack

The     last       thing       I'd    like       to    say     is t ha t       there       were      BBC    camera       cr e w s

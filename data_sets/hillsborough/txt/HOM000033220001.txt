THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - TAYLOR REPORT

I am writing further to my request for four copies of both the Interim and Final reports
of Lord Justice Taylorâ€™s inquiry into the above disaster, and your subsequent request
for further information.

2.     The Home Secretary has undertaken to consider the representations which
have been made for a further inquiry into the above disaster. We are unable to achieve
this with the few copies of each report that are currently available, and I should
therefore be grateful if you could process our request. We would appreciate it if the
copies could be obtained by Friday 27 June. We require copies we can keep.

3.       Please let me know if you have any further queries.




                                      PETER EDMUNDSON

        We spoke about Mr Hicks' phone call to the Home Officewconcernind
        the    position of Mr Peter Wright following the refusal of the
        South Yorkshire Police Authority to accept the Chief Constable's
        resignation.

        2.   I have since returned Mr Hicks' call and received the
        attached letter from him. Are you content for me to reply as in
        the draft attached?

        3.   I do not know exactly how positive a decision the Home
        Secretary took in respect of Mr Wright but I assume it was fairly
        positive or the Section 29 procedure would have been invoked
        earlier.    It may therefore be appropriate to include the
        paragraph in square brackets.

        4.    Mr Hicksindicated that the Families Support Group would
        probably wish to write to the Home Secretary direct and via their
        local MP.

                                                               (NAME OF SIGNATORY)

                        Thank you for your letter of 21 August about the position
                        of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter
                        Wright, and the South Yorkshire Police Authority.


                        The decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority not
                        to accept Mr Wright's offer of resignation is a matter                 i

                        for the Authority alone. There is no provision in police
                        service legislation for the Home Secretary to instruct or
                        overrule them on that.


                        There is a power under Section 29(1) of the Police Act
                        1964 for the Secretary of State to require a police
                        authority to exercise its power to call upon the chief
                        constable to retire in the interests of efficiency.        (The
                        Police Authority's po.wer is in Section 5(4).)        However,
                        the Home Secretary doas                   ^ ^ v o ^ e*^SectiorT
                        29(1) in this case.

[The Home Secretary believes* that Mr Wright took a proper
and courageous decision ift giving the Police Authority
the opportunity of considering his position in the light
of the interim findings yof the Taylor enquiry. The Home
Secretary does not feey however that it would be in the
interests of efficiency for him now to require the Police
Authority to seek Mr Wright's retirement.          He is
confident that Mr Wright is the right person to continue
to lead the South Yorkshire force.]


I know that the Home Secretary would want to express
again his sympathy to all the families and relatives
concerned for their great loss.

             appalled at the SYPA decision not to accept Mr Wright's resignation

             include any indication of the Home Secretary/Home Office’s position

            the    crush nearer          the     tu rnstiles.           A small       boy was       passed over the

anxious       to escape           the    crush and get        into       the ground.        I p o sitioned

myself       d i r e c t l y outs i d e Gate C in the flow of fans who                        had to       pass

either       side    of me.         T h e y were     told not       to    rush,    to take      their      time.

Hundreds       of fans must              have    passed me.         O n l y a few     running,       the others

wer e   orderly.          The      influx' died down to a small                   trickle a f t e r a few

               people out fro m an open gate                      in the fencing.                 A l o n g w i t h others         I

           v   each   person      I h e l p e d was alive a n d               conscious.          I helped one y o u t h                who

0fi O SM       said   to me that         people were           dying        in there        pointing at        the    terrace.

               At this tirce due           to the number            of      people     on or a r o u n d     the fence          I

               still     c o u l d n ’t see      thro u g h to the           terracing.           I moved     closer and               I saw

               that    there was a m ass              crush of bodies              just     inside      the fence.             It was

               a co n f u s i o n of    heads arms and              legs.         I saw one ma n who was                 obv i o u s l y

               dead but he was             hel d upright          by the        crush a n d his body m o v e d w i t h the

               crowd.       By this        time      I was     directly         outside      the small        open gate.

               Officers        inside      the    terracing wer e              passing      the      injured onto           the pitch

               a n d giving      first a i d         if n e c e s s a r y      I w o r k e d my wa y ac r o s s       to between

               the a m b u l a n c e w h i c h    had     pulled onto           the   track and the           perimeter            fence

               w h i c h had b een f o r c e d apart.               I c o n t i n u e d to assist          in carrying

               injured onto          the     pitch.

               A f t e r a short time            I climbed        into the         ter r a c i n g   t h r o u g h the      hole       in

               the fence and a s s i s t e d            in carrying            people     to the fence.              I assisted

               with approximately                10 people all              of w h o m wer e a l r e a d y    dead.

               E v e n t u a l l y the C e n t r e    sect i o n of the           terrace      cleared.         I remember

               that    soon a fter         this an a n n o u n c e m e n t was          b r oadcast      that the m a t c h

               would     not    be continued.              Whilst        I was     in the t e rracing an d on the

               p itch helping          the    injured man y L i v e r p o o l           fans were        di r e c t i n g    their

               a n g e r at the Police.               Calling       us m u r d e r e r s a n d that        it was        our

               fault.          Others      t h a n k e d me.

               After     the t e r r a c i n g    had clea r e d         I jo i n e d other o f f icers           on the

               halfway      line.       E v e n t u a l l y we made          our wa y back to the N o r t h S t a n d via

                                                                                                                     R333

              the L e p p i n g s L a n e terracing.

              Throughout         the    i n c ident both outs i d e a n d          inside the g r o u n d there

              s e e m e d to be      c o m m u n i c a t i o n problems.      It seemed that m a n y didn't k now

              what was going            on or what was          the    best      course of action.*           The    crush''

              o u t s i d e the g r o u n d    c o u l d p o s sibly hav e been better              controlled with

              mo r e P o l i c e O f f i c e r s an d a better         r e g u l a t i o n of the    flow of fans up

              to the t urnstiles.               At the time w h e n the            crush reached its height our

              particular         serial       see m e d to be down to a quarter                 s t r e n g t h of* what   it

              s h o u l d have    been.        I believe       that o p e n i n g the outer gates was a very

              n e c e s s a r y d e c i s i o n as   the s i t u a t i o n was    becoming      out of h a n d and a

              serious      risk of       injury.         Knowing      the H i l l s b o r o u g h G r o u n d as   I do and

              how the L e p p i n g s L a n e        end fills     up it m ight         possibly have          been better

              to direct        the     fans    coming      in t h r o u g h the    open gates        into    the flank

              areas,      which      I saw were         by no m eans       full.

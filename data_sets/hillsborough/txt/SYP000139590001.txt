   28th January 1991


   Dear Dr Popper,

   'lhank you for your letter of 17th January 1991.

   With regard to points 1-6 in your letter 1 would comment as follows:-

   1.   1 am obliged to you for your understanding in relation to Mr

   2.   lhank you for calling Mr Langley.

   3.   Noted.

   A.   The possibility of hearing from Amberline witnesses was initially
   suggested to me by Mr                 It has proved difficult to obtain names
   of individual drivers from the Company due to their confidentiality policy.
   1 believe that a number of drivers may have given statements to West
   Midlands Pol ice but at this stage of the Inquest 1 do not suggest that this
   matter be taken any further.

   5.   1 await your decision in relation to Mr Lloyd.

   6. 1 note that you do not intend calling P.C.        and am obliged too
   for^jcall ing Mr Robertson in order to clarity the summary into Jonathon's
   death.

   With regard to the outstanding queries of individual family members, 1 lode
   forward to hearing from you once the further review has been conducted by
   your Officers. If possible, it would be appreciated if we could be given
   some notice as to when queries are to be addressed.

   Thank you once again for your assistance.

   Yours sincerely,

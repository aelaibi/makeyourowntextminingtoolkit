SOMEONE SHOUTED TO OPEN THE GATE. THE GATE OPENED AND THERE WAS A BIG SURGE
OF PEOPLE. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO THE LEFT AND DID NOT GO DOWN THE TUNNEL. I
HAVE BEEN TO THE GROUND BEFORE AND IT WAS MORE ORGANISED THEN.
WHEN I GOT TO THE END TERRACE AND THE GAME HAD ALREADY STARTED. IT WAS THEN
THAT I COULD SEE THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE CENTRE.
I WAS BY THE FENCE ITSELF AND WHEN PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER INTO OUR
SECTION I WAS HELPING .
THERE WAS NO-ONE WHO COULD MOVE. I SAW PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER ONTO THE
PITCH. AT FIRST THE POLICE WERE TRYING TO GET THEM BACK AND THEN THEY
RMLISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. PEOPLE WERE SCREAMING HELP ME AND GET ME OUT
i P I a S TOTAL CHAOS. THE POLICE THEN PULLED DOWN THE FENCE AND HELPED TO GET
PEOPLE OUT.
THERE WERE BODIES LYING ON THE GROUND AND WERE HALF NAKED WHERE PEOPLE HAD
TRIED TO RESUSITATE THEM .
THE AMBULANCES ARRIVED AND AT FIRST WERE UNABLE TO GET INTO THE GROUND.
THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY        PEOPLE WERE JUST SCREAMING.
I AM A STEWARD AT ANFIELD . I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS AT ALL AT THE GROUND
OR OUTSIDE THE GROUND WHEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN.

I WENT IN THROUGH TURNSTYLE W AND HANDED IN MY TICKET.
I WENT TO WHERE MY SEAT WAS AND THERE WAS A LIVERPOOL FAN IN MY SEAT. HE
MOVED . ABOUT A MINUTE LATER THE GAME HAD STARTED.
FANS WERE THEN TRICKLING ONTO THE PITCH THE POLICE THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH
INVASION.
I WAITED ABOUT 10 MINS FANS WERE BEING RESUSITATED ON THE PITCH. AS SOON AS
THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY WERE MARVELLOUS. WHEN I GOT
OUTSIDE I SAW 4 OR 5 PEOPLE LYING OUTSIDE DEAD. THERE WAS A MAN LYING THERE
WITH HIS FALSE TEETH LYING ON TOP. HE WAS BLUE.

IMPOSSIBLE.

I ATTENDE THE GAME LAST YEAR AND IT WAS LIKE THIS LAST YEAR NO ORGANISATION.
I MANAGED TO GET INTO A TURNSTYLE THE ONE FURTHEST FROM THE GATE IN THE
WALL. I HANDED IN MY TICKET. AS I WENT THROUGH I WAS AWARE OF THE PRESSURE ON
ME THEN SUDDENLY IT STOPPED AND I COULD SEE THE GATE IN THE WALL WAS OPEN.
PEOPLE WENT THROUGH IT . I WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL IT SEEMED THE ONLY PLACE TO
GO BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE THE PITCH AND THE SIGN ABOVE THE TUNNEL SAID
ENTRANCE THERE WAS NO-ONE THERE TO GUIDE YOU OTHERWISE.
ONCE INSIDE THE GAME HAD    STARTED. AND THERE WAS A HUGECRUSH. I WASUNABLE
TO TURN ROUND FOR QUITE SOME TIME. I COULD SEE POLICE TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE
TO TURN BACK. I GABBED HOLD OF BARRIER . THE PRESSURE STARTED TO EASE OFF A A
AS PEOPLE STARTED TO GET OUT OF THE PEN . I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING THE FENCES TO
GB^OFF IT WAS NOT UNTIL I WENT OUTSIDE TO THE TUNNEL I REALISED HOW SERIOUS
rrfAS.
WHEN I*WENT OUTSIDE I SAW PEOPLE LYING DOWN
LAST YEAR THERE WAS JUST AS MUCH CRUSHING AS THIS YEAR ITSJUST THIS YEAR IT
HAD A WORSE OUTCOME.

AREA BEHIND THE GOAL. I THEN SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT OF THE
RILINGS. THE MATCH STILL HAD NOT STARTED AND ABOUT TEN MINUTES TO THREE I
THOUGHT HOW BADLY CONGESTED THE PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE. I THEN ACTUALLY
SAW SOMEONE BEING LIFTED OVER HEADS AND THEN OVER THE RAILINGS. THERE WAS A
LISLOF PANIC AT THIS TIME IN THE PENS. I TRIED TO SHOUT TO PEOPLE COMING IN
TCflfcSE PENS. I THEN NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE
LOWER TERRACING DIRECTLY INFRONT OF THE GOAL WERE NOT MOVING AND LOOKED
SERIOUSLY ILL TO ME. NEAR TO ME PEOPLE WERE PULLING PEOPLE UP OUT OF THE
PENS. I TRIED TO SHOUT TO A STEWARD AS I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE WEIGHT ON THE
BALCONY, I COULD NOW SEE PEOPLE COLLAPSING IN THE PENS AND TRYING TO CLIMLB
OVER ONTO THE PITCH, THERE WAS ABSOLUTE PANDAMONIUM. I AM
                                     I SAW IT ALL HAPPENING, EVERYTING.

             ABOUT 2,30. ITWAS CROWDED OUTSIDE AND YET ONLY TWO POLICE HORSES
             WERE OUTSIDE TRYING TO CONTROL THEM AND IF YOU TAKE INTO
             CONSIDERATION HOW MANY OFFICERS WERE AT THE TRAIN STATIONS ETC IT
             WAS RIDICULOUS. IT TOOK US ABSOLUTLEY AGES TO GET INTO THE
             GROUND AND THERE WERE A COUPLE OF POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE THE
             GROUND ITSELF AND I THINK

THEY WERE THERE FOR BACK UP. IT DID NOT MATTER HOW HARD WE TRIED TO GET
THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WE DID NOT SEEM TO MOVE. I SHOUTED AT ONE STAGE FOR
THE POLICE TO HELP THE POOR COPPERS OUTSIDE WHO WERE STRUGGLING AND THE GATES
WERE EVENTUALLY OPENED. THE CROWD THEN POURED IN, IF ANYTHING JUST TO GET
OUT OF THE CRUSH. I DID NOT HAVE MY TICKET CHECKED BY ANYBODY AND I CAN ONLY
RECALL SEEING THE STEWARDS ONCE AND THAT WAS BY THE STEPS LEADING TO THE
SEATING ON THE WEST STAND. I DID NOT KNOW THE LAY OUT OF THE GROUND SO I
MADE MY WAY THROUGH THE TUNNEL TO THE TERRACES. THERE WERE NO POLICE OR
S!0pRDS TO TELL US WHICH WAY TO GO.AS I WAS GOING THROUGH THE TUNNEL I
NOWCED HOW CROWDED IT WAS BEHIND MEAND THERE WAS REALLY NO WAY IN WHICH I
COULD TURN AROUND TO GET AWAY SO I FOLLOWED THROUGH. I MADE MY WAY TO PEN
THREE AND STOOD TO THE LEFT OF THE GOAL AT THE BACK.   I COULD NOT MOVE AT ALL
AND WAS AT ONE STAGE CRUSHED UP AGAINST THE BARRIER. I REMEMBER SEEING TWO
POLICE OFFICERS IN THE SEATING AREA LOOKING DOWN AND SEVERAL OF US SHOUTED
FOR HELP TO TELL THEM HOW CROWDED ITWAS. I THINK ONE OFTHEM HAD A RADIO.
PEOPLE THEN TRIED TO GET OVER THEFENCE BUT THE POLICE AT THE FRONT JUST
PUSHED THEM BACK OVER. NOBODY KNEW HOW BAD IT WAS. AT ONE STAGE I COULD NOT
MOVE AND PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER EACH OTHER JUST TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. THE
MAN IN FRONT OF ME SCREAMED AND I NOTICED THAT HIS LEG HAD BEEN BROKEN. I
COULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR HIM. PEOPLE CONTINUED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE AND
I MANAGED TO MAKE MY WAY DOWN AND CLIMB OVER. THE POLICE AT THAT STAGE
THOUGHT THERE WAS A FIGHT AND THE CORNERED OFF PART OF THE PITCH TO STOP
PEOPLE MILLING ONTO THE GROUND. WHEN I GOT OVER I WITNESSED INJURED PEOPLE
BEING DRAGGED AROUND AND PEOPLE TRYING TO GIVE DEAD PEOPLE THE KISS OF LIFE.
THERE APPEARED TO BE NOBODY MEDICALLY TRAINED TO DIAL WITH THE INCIDENT. I
JUST WATCHED WHAT WAS GOING ON. ONCE THE POLICE REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON
THEY WERE MARVELLOUS, THEY DID EVERYTHING THAT THEY COULD.    AT ONE STAGE I
ACTUALLY SAW A COUPLE OF POLICE AND THE FANS TRYING TO BREAK ONE OF THE
BARRIERS DOWN AND THEY MANAGED TO BEND IT SO PEOPLE COULD GET OUT. THE GATE
LEADING ONTO THE PITCH WAS NOT OPENED UNTIL I HAD ACTUALLY GOT OUT ONTO THE
PITCH.

            POLICE DOING CROWD CONTROL AND A CRUSH STARTED BY THE
            TURNSTILES. THE POLICE OPENED THE SLIDING DOORS AT ABOUT 2.50PM

IN THAT WAY AND WERE NOT ASKED TO SHOW TICKETS. I STILL HAVE MINE. ONCE
INSIDE, THERE WERE NO STEWARDS TO DIRECT THE CROWDS OR ANY SIGN POSTS. THE
FIRST THING YOU SEE IS THE TUNNEL, WHICH I WENT DOWN AND CAME OUT AND WENT TO
THE LEFT INTO PEN 4. IT STARTED GETTING REALLY PACKED AND I WAS PUSHED
FORWARD AGAINST A BARRIER AND PINNED THERE SO THAT I COULDNT MOVE. MY BROTHER
MANAGED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE SPACE SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO DUCK UNDER THE
BARRIER SO THAT I WAS ONLY BRUISED. PEOPLE WERE CRYING AND SCREAMING AND
TRYING TO CLIMB OUT ONTO THE PITCH BUT THE POLICE WERE THROWING THEM BACK. I
M2M3ED TO GET TO THE SIDE AND CLIMBED OVER THE SPIKED FENCE AND ONTO THE
PITCH.

THE MIDDLE OF THE TERRACE WAS PACKED FULL OF PEOPLE, AND IT CONTINUED TO FILL

ONTO THE PITCH. MOST PEOPLE WENT DOWN THE TUNNEL ON ENTERING THE GROUND
BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS WAY TO THE TERRACE.

              BUT THE PRESSURE OF THE CROWD STOPPED THIS FROM WORKING
              PROPERLY. THEY SHOULD HAVE OPENED THE GATE NEXT TO THE TURNSTYLES

THEY DID OPEN A GATE IN THE WALL AND PEOPLE WERE GOING IN. NO-ONE WAS ASKING
TICKETS. IT WAS A MATTER OF SO MANY GETTING IN QUICK AND CLOSE THE GATE.
THE POLICE MAN OPENED THE IRON GATE AND LET SO MANY THROUGH AND THEN CLOSED
IT. I GOT THROUGH THIS GATE I DIDNOT HAND IN MY TICKETS.
THERE WERE NO STEWARDS TO TELL YOU WHERE TO GO.
I HAVE NOT BEEN TO THIS GROUND BEFORE BUT BROTHER AND SON HAD AND KNEW THAT
IT WAS BETTER TO MAKE FOR THE WING SIDE OF THE TERRACE BECAUSE OF THE
CRUSHING THEY EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR.
WEH.ITED ABOUT 6 MINS FOR THE GAME TO START. AND LOOKING ACROSS AT THE
MIDDLE SECTION IT WAS ALREADY CHAOTIC. THERE WAS TERRIBLE PRESSURE THEN.
THEY WERE SWAYING UP AND DOWN . WHEN FORRfiST ACTUALLY ATTACKED THAT IS WHEN
THEY ALL MOVED FORWARD.
THE POLICE WERE JUST STANDING AROUND . THERE WERE NO AMBULANCES THERE JUST ST
JOHNS THERE.
FANS WERE TRYING TO GET INTO THE SIDE PARTS AND ONTO THE PITCH. A FAN I SAW
ON THE PITCH 2 POLICE JUST THREW HIM TO THE SIDE OF THE PITCH THEY JUST
DIDNOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.
I SAW SOME FANS TRYING TO TEAR THE FENCE DOWN AND IT WOULD NOT GO.
THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT MADE ON THE TANNOY TO TELL US WHAT HAPPENEDALL
THAT WAS SAID WAS ABOUT ONE HOUR LATER WAS TO KEEP OUR TICKETS.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH

heard P C 1       5     Reeves     say that we all               had to get           into       the ground as

q ui ck l y as     possible.           I entered the gr ou nd via gate                           ' O ’ and as         1

passed an Officer                of either         the    rank    of Chief           Inspector        or       Inspector

was d i re c t e d by him to the Leppings                        Ln end where              he said there was a

'pitch     i n v a s i o n ’ and direct            to    'get them off              the    pitch’.         On    reaching

the Wes t S t a n d       (Le ppings Ln end)               I realised that a                  large    number             of

fans wsre         in distress,          pressed agai ns t             the wire            s ec ur it y fence.              I

bre at hi ng w hen t aken by either                    stretcher        or hoarding      for futher

medical          assistance.           I am unable        to say what        time    this was       but    by now

most     of the       i njured were           receivingsas si stance and the               crush behind the

barrier          had been    relieved.      A short lime later I a s s i s t e d in clearing

the    pitch a nd        col le ct ed several bags of p ro perty w h i c h I conve ye d to

the    gym.



At 6 .00         pm   (1800 hrs)        1 took a meal          break at the mobile               canteen

O ff i c e r s    d e pa rt ed   for    the M o r t u a r y at B a r n s l e y DGH.       It soon became

clear that we were                not    required and          I returned with other O ff icers

to C l a yw h ee ls Ln.

Du ri ng    the time          in w h i c h   I was     on the    pitch     I can say that           the moo d of

the    fans       can be best          d e s c r i b e d as angry,      largely due      to their         being    in

a state of shock.                 Any h o s t il it y w hi ch      I e n c o u n t e r e d was   I believe,

due    to their grief and state                      of mind after w i t n e s s i n g     such a tragedy.



At no time did I handle any of the                           bodies.

               behind        the    Leppings           Lane     turnstiles            (1-8).

               I was       aware      t ha t    other      officers         were       outside         the    ground      directly

               outside        the     turnstiles           where       I was      positioned.

               started        to    come       through        the     turnstiles.               I saw     that    there       were     two

At    th is      time      a     large          metal           g ate      was    opened.              This       formed            part        of a

fence       which          divided             the      supporters               with        tickets          for      the N o r t h           stand

an d West         stand.                  A     portable           metal barrier                fence         was      then placed

across        the      gate           allowing              a n u m b e r of          other        turnstiles                 to    be       u s e d to

allow       supporters                with           tickets          for       the   North           stajid to          enter           the

ground.           This         barrier               was    manned          by    f our       yet ;J/ow;''jacketed' it'ewards.

As    the     number           of     supporters                  entering            the     ground          increased a number                          of

to    snatch          tickets             from a turnstile                       operator.             Th e      operator               called       for

help and          I went             to       hi s    assistance.                 Ticket           stubs         were        all        over       the

floor       of    the       turnstile.                     T he    operator             had     hold        of    the        fan        by    the    hand

however          I could             not       see      the       f an as        he w a s       being         shielded              by       persons

already          in    the       turnstile.                     The     operator             let      go    of    the        fan a n d         he

disappeared                into       the        crowd which                had       now     developed             outside.

At    th is      time       I noted              t h at     we w e r e          without         any        form     of       supevisory

fan who          had a ticket.                        I immediately                   detained             him and           informed              him    of

condition           outside.

At     t his     t ime    I saw an           Inspector               (name       not       k n o w n ) who       was     stood                    by the

required and              t h at     persons         would           be    seriously             injured         if     the        situation

being      forced         open .          I saw      that        a    number       of P o l i c e            officers         had                taken

up    station        by    gate       A.        Fans      h ad       started       to       climb          the   outer        w a 1 It

At    this         time      I saw P o lice                  Sergeant          Wright             walk     past w i t h         several

other        officers             apparently                 attempting             to       get    outside.

By 3pm           (1500)          th e    pressure              outside         was       at       its w o r s t .         People          were

screaming              and       shouting            for       something            to       be    done.           The    turnstiles

areas        were          choked        solid with                 people       and         I was       assisting             in    pulling

persons            through          them.

A    loud        roar w a s         heard          from        the    inside         of       the       ground and             the       crush

seemed           to    get       worse.            This        was    obviously               the       t ea m s    entering             the     pitch.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y            3.05pm          (1505)        that         date       the       two    gates          A a n d 8 were

opened and a flood                           of     persons          entered          the         ground.           At    thi s      time        there

was     a    further             loud        roar          f r o m the     crowd      in t he           ground and              the           persons

pouring            into      the        ground             accelerated             their           pace.           There      was        no w a y   of

checking              tickets           or    directing              any    of      the       crowd.           It w a s        a stampede              of

people           it w a s        t o t al     chaos          they     had      but       one       thing       on t h e i r         minds        and

At    a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 3 . 0 & p m              (1506)        that       date         I was        informed            that       there

was     a    pitch          invasion and                   t h at    officers            had       been       requested             to a t t e n d

I saw        that          there        were       a number           of    supporters                  on the       fi eld ,        it was

were    a number             of    persons          who     had     been       forced           up    into       the a i r        by the

helpless          to    prevent          it.        I saw DS M o r t on aga in and                          said       to    him

something          like       "There          must      be a b o u t         twenty        or    thirty          dea d".

rotting       carcase             of m e at .        They were               disgusting              in t h e i r      attitude

towards       life       they        did      not    help,        give        any     form       of a i d        or a s s i s t a n c e              to

climbed down from                       the     fence     and     I saw Chief                Superintendent Nesbit                              wh o

get    to     behind           the      spaghetti         of    bodies.

There       were       a     number       of     fans m i l l in g         around and               obviously             were        in a

eyes     were       glazed           s o me     covered        in v o m i t       and mucus,               others         were

moaning,           others          who    were     trapped           by    their         limbs w e r e           screaming             for

h elp.

The    crowd        had m ov e d          back     by     now a nd         the        pressure           at     the      front        of       the

fence       was     such        that      the     persons        at       the     front          ha d    fallen/flopped                    back

onto     the       blob       of     bodies       behind.            Bodies           appeared           to     be a b o u t      six          or

seven       deep.

I immediately                 set       about     getting        these           persons          out     of     the      pen a n d w i t h

other       officers            started         to m o v e      them       through           the        gate.         One   of        the

first,      I pulled            out      was    a s m al l      woman/girl,                 she     had       been       pressed           -----

against          the       f en c e ,    she a p p e a r e d     dead,           she w a s        trapped           by    the     leg
it t o o k        s o me     moments            to    extract             her     from       the    pile        of    bodies.           She      was

wearing           a red       football               t y pe        shirt,        longish mousey                 hair,       I handed            the

body      to PC F a i r c l o u g h              who       was       slightly           behind          me   to m y        left       near      to

t he    gat®.

A man,          alive,        was          trapped             from       the     waist       d own.         He      was    shouting            for

hel p,       together            with          others          I attempted              to    pull       him      free*          I couldn't

do     this       because            of    the       spaghetti              of    other       bodies         so      I started           pulling

bodies          from a r ou n d            him.           I cannot           say       how many          I personally                 moved      but

I rembmer              that      a    chain          of    officers              was    by n ow w o r k i n g          and       I passed

the     bodies          I recovered                  to    them and              then    passed          out      through         the     g a te

onto      th e     pitch.

Fans      were         now    helping            to       pull       bodies        from       the       ’blob'        and       I remember

th at     I found a ma n/y ou th                          IS y e a r s       still       alive          he w a s      breathing

however           he    was      trapped             from          the    neck     down.           He    wa s     pushed hard

against           the      concrete             w a ll     below          the     metal       barrier           fen c e .        T he    youth

was     unconscious,                      I s h o u t e d at             him and        remember             slapping           his     fac e    and

telling           him      to h o l d          on.        We       removed        the    bodies          t ha t      were       around        him

and     he      was     subsequently                  passed             through        the    gate.            I saw       officers and

fans      pulling            the      perimeter                fence        down       with    their         ba re     h an d s .

I left          the     pen      carrying a body                         of a m a n a p p a r e n t l y           dead wi th a number

of     fans       the      body       was       placed             onto     the    pitch where               I cheeked            for     s i gns

of     life.           There         were       none,          a    number        of    fans       then      turned         up     carrying

an a d v e r ti s in g           board and                the       man was        then       placed         onto      the       b oa r d .

There        appeared            to       be    hundreds             of     people       on    the       p i t c h at       this        time     I

could        see       people         giving mouth                   to m o u t h       to    persons           on    the       pitch.          Some

were      working            very         ha rd,      others             were     milling          around         obviously             in a

state        of    sho c k .          There          was       an ambulance              on    the       pitch.            I saw        numbers

of     f an s     moving         bodies          on b o a r d s .

I went          with       the       body       I ha d         recovered           towards          the K o p         on a n a r e a          n ea r _

people        receiving               treatment            for    their      injuries.                 I saw a man              dead       on

th e    floor         who       I now      know       to    be P e t e r     TOOTLE.              He    was        lying    f ac e        up    ,

tracksuit             from       h is    face.         It w a s         obvious        he w a s        dead.         I r e m o v e d my

anorak        and      placed           it o v e r     the       body and waited                  till        fans    arrived             with

a further             board       and      I went          with     th e    body       to    the       g ym    situated             at    the

On     entering            the    gym      it w a s        like     a battle           fie ld,         bodies        were

everywhere.                    I was     asked        by    someone         if T o o t l e        was    alive        or    dead,          and

I w&s      told        to      find a space                in t he       first      section and                s t a y w i t h the

b ody.        I cannot            say who           i n f o r m e d me.          The     body was             placed       on       the

floor      towards              the     centre        of    the     floor        a r e a.

There      were        a       large     number        of       f ans    Police        and     relatives             of    dead

the re.          I kept          the     body       covered         thanked         the      fans       for        their    help: a n d

set a b o u t         making          a detailed            description             of      the    body.            I checked             for

identification                   there        was     none.

However          there         was      a number           of    i t em s   of    jewellery.

At     3.54pro        (1554)          Doctor        8 ull       from     the R o y a l       h a l l a m s h i re H o s p i t a l          came

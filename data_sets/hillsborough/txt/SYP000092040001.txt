MyseIf,                      and             had not got tickets         for     the football      game

and    intended to          purchase    tickets outside       the ground.



The    three of us a r ri v ed outside            the H i l l s b o ro u gh ground   in Leppings

Lane at about            1.30pm    (1330).


                                        O V l       5
I have      been a supporter           of Liverpool Football         Clu b for most of rny life

and    I intended to          purchase any ticket         I could obtain w h ic h was for the

Liverpool        end of the        ground.



At    1.30pm     (1330)      there were a large amount           of.people milling aro un d            in

the area of the L ep pi ng s Lane             entrance     to the ground.



We a p p r o a c h e d   numerous     people and a sk ed them if they had an y spare

tickets w hi c h they w is he d to sell,              but we were      not offered any spare

tickets.



At about       1.45pm       (1345)    the three    of us w al k ed a ro u nd         the S pi on Kop

end of the ground to try and                 purchase     tickets.

                               /
At the S pi o n Kop y/nd of the ground we met                                        and his

9                                      is a fel 1ow student                 was also      trying    to

buy a ticket.



Once we a rr i ve d at          the S pion Kop end of the g r o u n d , it quickly became

evident       that       there were    numerous    spare tickets available.              There were

a large       number       of Liverpool      supporters at that end of the ground,

buying      tickets        from N o tt i n g h a m supporters.
                   saw a man s ta nding               holding an envelope          in his hand.         I could see

                what    I w ould estimate              to have      en between twenty and thirty tickets

                in the envelope.



                W it h other       s up p o rt er s    I a pp ro a ch e d this man.        All   the   tickets   he was

                selling were          orange      in colour and          I believe    they were all        standing

                tickets        for the S pi on Kop terraces.


T o o l ^
                He was     charging        ten    pounds for each tic              t which had a face value o-P

                six    pounds.

                The man        I p u r chased my ticket           from    I w ould describe as a white male,

                a ged about        forty years?          about 5ft       1Qins tall and m ed iu m        in build.

                The only thing           I can really         remember about         him is that he had a full

                beard.         As far as       I can remember the man was wearing a N o t ti n gh a m

                F orest    scarf and         I think      he had a N o t ti n gh a ms h ir e accent.



                M y s e 1f ,                                        and            , all    had ticket/ for the

                S pion Kop terraces,              but we all       deci de d to     return to the^/_eppings Lane

                end of the ground and to try and get                        into    that end of the ground to

                stand with the Liverpool                  supporters.

               people a c t ua l ly entering       the ground - the Police were just                keeping an

               eye on things.         I think    I may have seen one steward outside                  the

               entrance      to the ground,      but    I c a n ’t be sure.



               All     five of us d e ci de d to see      if they w ou ld a llow us       into the Leppings

               L ane    end of the ground w ith our S pion Kop tickets,               and we a pp ro ac he d

               the turnstiles.         The area between the turnstile            gates and the outer

               perimeter      gates was very quiet and we went            to the     t u r n s ti l e- s it u at e d

               on the     right-hand side       of the terrace       turnstile   block as / o u          look from

               Leppings Lane.          I now know this turnstile          to be turnsVxle



               I noticed that       the man going        through the turnstile        in front        of me was
CAT
w/t\7n+        also     holding an orange       coloured ticket.        I saw h /m    gain access           through

e ^ r e . 'i   the turnstile and        I followed him into          the turfc/tile at about 2.10pm




               I handed my        ticket to the turnsti Ke operator.          As far as       I    can

               remember he        removed one    portion of the ticket.          I know he handed              me

               one     portion    of the ticket.       The turnstile    operator     did not say

               a n y thing   to   me and I w al ke d through the turnstile           into the ground.



               I have     retained the    portion of my ticket w hich was             returned to me.                  It

               is a S pi o n Kop standing        ticket,    Serial   Number   17 49 KP6.           I wish to

               retain the ticket,        but will       produce   it if required to do so.                I would

               w ish    it to be    returned to me.



               The     turnstile    operator    I can only     remember as a white male.                All    I can

               say about      him   is that    he was                   I w ould say      in his middle

The five       of us all met       on the ground side       of the turnstiles.



At no time whilst          I was    outside the ground did           I see any sort       of

disorder       or fighting.        As far as     I can remember      X had seen people

drinking       cans of beer,       but    Ican't    remember   seeing anyone who          I

thought      to be drunk.                                                  /

Once    inside    the ground     I did not see any signs dij/ecting people to

policemen or stewards             by the entrance to trie /tunnel         or anywhere along

its    length.



All    five of us      remained together.           We walked out of the turyne 1 and

over to our       right
                      into what I now know to be pen number tbfree.        The

first     position we took up in pen three at about 2 . 1 5 pm \(/ 415) was

about     four   or five feet away from the front              perimeter       fence and the

gate w a y    in the   fence was about          the same distance      to our    right.        I

have m a r k e d this     position on the separate          grid plan using a figure

one.



H aving      got to    position one      relatively easy because         the terraces were

fairly empty at that             time,   we    remained there for about        ten minutes.

In position one          1 was    only at      eye level w ith the playing       surface       of

the    pitch,    so we decided       to move      further   back up the    pen to get a

better       position.



At about 2 . 2 5 p m     (1425)    we took up a position near to the wall                 at the

back    of the    pen and about          ten feet away from the dividing           fence of

pens    numbers       three and two.          I have ma rk ed this    position on the

separate        grid   plan using a figure two.



All    five of us       remained together at                position two and g r ad ua ll y the           pen

filled up wit h         supporters.           I can remember          standing    in this       position

at 2. 5 0 p m    (1430)    reading my m atch              programme and at that          time a lt ho ug h

the    pen was      filling     up it was          not full     to   capacity.



At about 2 . 5 5 pm       (1455)     I can remember            seeing   the   players     come out onto

the    pitch for their          pre~kick~off             kick about and at       that    time    I was

starting        to feel    quite     packed        in.     I noticed that the        pressure around

me was    increasing         n o ti ce ab ly and the situa                               Lng very

uncomfortable.


                                                                                         KLI 0 <
I can remember          the game kicking             off and at                          P time    there

was a huge        crowd surge w hi ch             pushed me ove                          land side

about    five     feet and towards            the fence divi                             ?rs three and

two.



After    this     surge    occurred,         all    the    people aro un d me seemed to be

swirling around.             I was    being m ov ed a ro u nd and had no control                   over my

movements.

I can remember          seeing Peter i                            ing a shot at the N ot ti n gh a m

Forest    goal and hitting            the     i                      when this h ap pe n ed everyone

was    trying     to jump up to see                               pened.      This   increased      the

forward m ov ement         of the     crowi                       nd I noticed an        increase        in

At about        the time B E A R D S L E Y    hit the       crossbar    I not i c<ed that       people at

the front        of the    pen were      climbing

                                                           up over    the fro/it perimeter          fence.

I. saw then both s upporters and Police                     on the front       perimeter       fence

shouting at       people      in the    pen to get back,            but    it was   impossible     to




At about 3 . 1 0 p m    (1510)     I was        pulled up into the kfest S t an d seating

are a by supporters.                    and            had also        been pulled up into the

stand.



Once    I got up into the stand                 I likewise       helped    in pulling    other

supporters      up to     relieve      the      pressure    in the terracing          below.



At about 3. 15 pm       (1513)     I stood further           back up the West S ta nd with

        and             and   looked down onto             the    pitch.     It was    o nly then that

I could see      that     something       really serious           had occurred.        I could see a

lot of people        being    dragged out of the             pen,    both over      the fencing and

through the small          gate.



I stood up in the          stand     looking down onto the                pitch and    I saw a lot of

bodies    laid out on the          pitch,       some young and some still,              and    people

a dm i ni s t e ri ng mouth--to--mouth resuscitation.



I could not describe            in any details any of the bodies                    I saw on the

pitch    in any detail,         except for one man.



At about 3 . 2 3 p m    (1325)     my a t t e n ti o n was       drawn to this man who was

lying on his back on the               grassed area s urrounding              the   playing     surface

of the    pitch.       He was     positioned to the              r ight-hand side of the

Liverpool     goal as      I looked from the West Stand.                     He was about       twenty

feet away from the            r ight-hand goal        post.        A St John's a m bu l a n c e m a n was

giving    the man m o u t h - t o - m o u t h    resuscitation.           There was a w oman
                                                                                               PAGE        8

standing       over them;    she was       crying.     As       far as    I can remember     the

w o m a n was wear i n g a   white top and denim             jeans.



The m o u t h — to --mouth went     on for what       seemed      like a long       time a nd then

someone,       I think    it was the St J o h n ’s man,           covered this man's          head

w ith his brown      leather jacket.             The man whose        head had been        covered,

and    I presume had died,          I can only describe as               a white male aged about

50 years w ith short         brown hair       cut back over        his     ears,       He was      of

m e d i u m build.   He was wearing           black trousers,         a white      shirt   or tee

shirt,    and the brown waist             length    leather      jacket    b l ou so n- ty pe with

e l a s t ic a t e d waist and    cuffs.     The jacket         had been used to       cover    the

m a n ’s head,                                              /



After    the terracing at          the front of pen n                                                "ed

of supporters,       X saw a huge          pile o-fV bodies       spreading     back from the

wall    beneath the front          perimeter       tfence for a distance           of about eight

feet.     This    pile of bodies was             spread across      the front of the          pen for

a distance       on either       side    of the gate    in the      perimeter       fence.

Although       X looked down at          this scene    for      some time,     1 cannot      describe

any of the       individuals       I saw    in that    pile of bodies.



I think    I finally       left    the ground at some            time between 4, 3 G p m      <1630)

an d 4.43pm      (1645)   of my own accord.



I was    not    injured at Hillsborough.

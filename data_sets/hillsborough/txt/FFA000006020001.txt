 POR THE ATTENTION OF

 Dear Sirs
 The Football Association Limitad: Annual Audit 1989
 We refer to your letter of 14 December 1989 •
  1.        As to the specific natters raised:
             (a) Hillsborough
            We were instructed following the Hillsborough tragedy
            which occurred on 15 April 1989. We have and
            continue to advise the FA on various aspects of this
            matter.
            we represented the FA, together with John Dyson QC
            and Julian 6ibson-Watt of Counsel, at the Taylor
            Inquiry from 15 May to 29 June 1989. Herbert Smith,
            solicitors for the FA'S public Liability insurers,
            were kept closely informed* We understand that
            coverage under the policy has been accepted. The FA
            has received numerous letters making claims from
            solicitors representing the bereaved and injured
            following the tragedy. These have been passed on to
            Herbert smith who are dealing with these matters.
            The letters have not to date resulted in legal
            proceedings being brought by any party against the
            FA. in tha light of lord Juatioa Taylor•• Intari*
            Raport of X August 1989 and his Final Report of 18
            January 1990 any such action would be vigorously
            contastad. At thi. .tag. it i. not powibla to
            assess the level of claims nor, as a result, whether
            the insurance cover would be adequate in the event

     that claims were brought against the FA and the FA
     was found liable in any way.
     If you wish to discuss this item further, Miss
     Josanne Rickard is the relevant Partner here.
     (b) ITV Dispute
     Although no legal proceedings have been commenced
     against the FA by ITV, the latter has made a
     complaint to the European Commission under Article 85
     of the Treaty of Rome in respect of the FA's contract
     with the BBC and British Satellite Broadcasting (BSB)
     and the application of certain provisions of FIFA and
     UEFA regulations. This complaint has been responded
     to by the FA, and by the BBC and BSB, but the parties
     have not yet been informed of any decision by the
     European Commission and the outcome is uncertain.
     In the event that the European Commission finds that
     that there has been an infringement of the Treaty of
     Rome, it is likely that the parties would be required
     to amend and/or terminate the arrangements; in
     addition, although in our view unlikely in the case
     of the FA, the parties may be subject to possible
     fines which could exceed £50,000.
     If you wish to discuss this item further,
              Ls the relevant Partner.
2.   As you will know from previous years, in accordance
     with recommendations made by the Law society it is
     not our practice to respond to questions of a
     non-specific nature concerning contingent liabilities
     for audit purposes. However, if you wish to raise
     any other specific questions relating to any
     identified matters with which we have been concerned,
     we will be pleased to consider them.
3.   Bills in respect of our fees and expenses for the
     period ended 31 December 1989 have now been rendered.
     No unbilled work in progress as at that date remains
     outstanding.

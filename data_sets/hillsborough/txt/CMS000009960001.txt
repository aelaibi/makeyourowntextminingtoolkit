                    LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ..Lord Ferrers........
                                                        (NAME OF SIGNATORY)



                    When we met on 4 April I told you that the powers to set

                    up the Football Licensing Authority would come into force

                    on     1 June    and   that we hoped       that     it would    be up and

                    running as soon as possible after that.                It will be clear

                    to you     that the process has            taken    longer than we had

                    expected.



                    I hope     that we     shall   be able      to make     an announcement

                    about     membership     of    the   FLA    quite    soon    even    if   for

                    entirely practical reasons it is unlikely that the new

                    licensing       system will     become     fully    effective       for some

                    months.     A considerable amount of preparatory work has

                    been completed in consequence of the changed emphasis in

                    the role of the Authority, but the FLA will be exercising
entirely new functions and it will take time to recruit

and train its staff and inspectors.



I can understand that the football authorities will wish

to discuss    a range of            issues with the FLA as soon as

possible.     But it would be quite misleading to suggest

that the football clubs must wait for the FLA to be set

up    before; making         the     improvements         to   their        grounds

proposed by Lord Justice Taylor.



I thought therefore that               I should write to you,                    since

both   your   President        and    the     Chairman     of the          Football

Association are in Italy, to give you a clearer idea of

how    we   see   the        FLA    operating        in   relation          to    the

recommendations         in    the     Taylor    report         on    all     seated

accommodation.          I hope       this     will    enable        you    to    give

clearer guidance to the clubs.



The Government's view has always been that the primary

responsibility       for responding to Lord Justice Taylor's

recommendations      on all         seated accommodation rests with

the clubs themselves.              The Taylor report is quite clear

in    recommending      that       standing    accommodation          should be

progressively removed by 1993, 1994 or 1999, depending on

the nature of the matches for which the grounds are used.

In order to meet that overall timetable, clubs will need

to be planning -indeed should have been planning for the

past 6 months - on how they will achieve it.
The FLA will itself have no powers to require all seated

accommodation unless the Home Secretary makes a direction

in respect            of a particular       football      ground.     When the

licensing scheme is in operation, we shall be looking to

the FLA to examine the plans which clubs have made and to

advise us on the progress which is being made towards all

seated      accommodation.                Nevertheless,        in   the        first

instance         at    least    it will    be     for the clubs      to decide

whether     to        simply reduce       standing     accommodation or to

make   proposals          for additional          seating using their own

funds or those which the Government has made available

through       the       Football     Trust        in   consequence        of    the

reduction in pools betting tax.



Only   in     those      cases     where    progress      is   unsatisfactory

should it be necessary to resort to a formal direction.
We hope these will be few.



I have already indicated to you and your colleagues from

the Association and the Football League that we shall not

insist      on    strict       adherence     to    Lord   Justice     Taylor's

interim timetable if satisfactory progress is being made.

The interim timetable as you know envisaged reductions of

standing capacity by 2 0% or 10% a year depending on the

type of match being played but regardless of the amount

of seated accommodation already provided.



We   accept      that there may be              a need to prioritise the

available funds.               We also recognise that it might suit
some clubs to make maj or changes to their grounds which

will exceed the Taylor recommendations but which cannot

be achieved in a single season.                 We also want clubs to

make    use    of    the       available     money   to     improve    their

accommodation,       not       simply   to   make    piecemeal      changes,

particularly        if   they     are    unlikely     to    contribute    to

improvements in safety or public order.                     This does not

mean that we shall expect the interim timetable to be

ignored altogether.             It remains as a guide and it will

not    be    open   to     a    club    to   avoid   reducing       standing

accommodation for no reason other than that it has plans

for major redevelopment at some ill-defined date in the
future.



I hope that this provides a basis for any clubs who have

not    yet     applied          their    thoughts      to     all     seated

accommodation to start making plans.

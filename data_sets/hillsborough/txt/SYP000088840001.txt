             sleep       and       others          talking.               Then       we       had     a    game       of    football,             not     all

             of    us,    but          the    majority.               This       took          us     up    to       near       enough       midday,

             we    then       walked          down,       some        talked             to    some        Police          Officers          and       I went

             and    bought             some       food.        We     talked             to    t he       Officers          and       asked       if

             there       were          any    pubs       open        but    they          said        they          were    all       closed       for        a 3

             mile       radius.              The       Policewoman              told          us    that        a    pub       called    The       Fox

             would       be    open,          and       she    directed              us       to    it.

             The    van       by       now    had       been     parked          up       in a        car       park       on    an    industrial

              state       we       were       directed           there                   the       Police.

             We    all    walked             up    to    The     F              it       was       crowded,           all       I could       see        were

             Liverpool             f a n s . There            was     quite          a    b it      of     drinking             going    on       b ut    no

             drunkeness.                    I had       two    pints.

             We    then       sat       around          for    a while           talking.                  We       set    off    for    the       ground           at

There        was     a man         on         the          pitch          side       of    the      ba r,      he    grabbed          my    left

arm,      he      was     trying                 to    pull          me    up    but       he      c o u l d n ’t.        Eventually             he

said;        "R un ,     g et      to            the       front."              So    I somehow             managed            to    scramble           on

At     t»is       tysrfe,       play          was          still          going       on.          I think          I was       the    first          person

over      the      fence.              Some            had       already             come       out      through          the       gate.

The     man       who    grabbed                  my       arm       was       a white          male,       about         30—33       yrs

old,      he      had    very          short               hair,          light       brown         hair,       he    had       a    bit    of

stubble           I think.                   Thats          all       1 can          remember            about       him.

At     that       stage,         I d i d n ’t               realise             how       bad      it    was    behind          me.        I turned

round        to    look         for          rny f r i e n d s            and    the       sight         I was       met       witn    was

horrendous.

There        were        people              crushed             up       against          the      front       fence          with    their          faces

pushed         through           the          mesh,             their          fingers          pushed         through          as    well.           i-,e o p i e

were      vomiting              with             it    on       their          faces,         in    their           hair,       on the      mesh.            1

almost         vomited           myself.                    I was          totally            shocked,              I didn't know            what         to

Another           lad     came         over            to       me    and       asked         if    I was       OK.         I said         yes,       and        he

         the     game,

         Ws    approached                  a    Police             Officer,            he w a s a n         older       one       with a        flat

         He     said;        "No,           I ’m     not      authorised               to."

         1 he other              la u      grabbed            my     arm       and     said       corns      c^ji 1 e}, s/ s t o p        the    game

         The     same        Police             Officer             came       up     to    us    a/fci t o l d     us       to    clear        th e

         As     I walked                 off,      I met        Nigel                           and    he    was    almost           in    tears.

         He     put     his          arm       round         me,     he    said;           "I    wish       there       was       something            I

         could         do."

         After         talking             to      him       for     a while,               I went      back       over       to     the    fence,

         there         was       a       line      of    Police           on     the       fence,       waving          people        back       and

         I began            to       look       for      my     friends.               1 was          then    joined          by                 and

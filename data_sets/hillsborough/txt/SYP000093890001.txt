             after        c                                       en 5 I then went

              n arrow gate onto           the    pitch the game had been stop p e d by this time.                                           I

             met        one of my friends         over by the Liverpool                  stand        in fact four of us

             met        up by there.       It\as     here     that we      realised that                   people         needed help

             and        in fact we saw one otSpu^ friends                  lying         injured just                 in front         of

              the LiverpB^l            stands at first we thought                 he had broken his                       legs,       so

              we    pul-'led down^tme       of the hoardings and              put him onto                   it.        We then

              carried hihv down the              pitch to the gym n a s i u m and                 left him there with

              the arniHjlance man,

             His        name wa«                       he used to         live      in

              but has now m o v e d to                     but    I ’ve no     idea of the address,                             his
                                                                                                                         PAG E          2
                                                                                                                         S 3815

                  injuries were         not as serious as we thought and                         in fact      I think he had

                  a slight      back    injury.

                  After     leaving him we went backNto assist                           some other      persons.       All   in

                  all    I a s s i s t e d to     carry three or fcKjr persons                 out of there,           I believe

                  appearance.

                to 1 have m e n t i o n e d in my questls^nnai re that whilst I was in pen 4 there

4o                was a man standing               behind me against a barrier.                     I do not        recollect      if

    N             •the match was        still        in play or n o t \ As            I was a t t e m p t i n g   to get out of

                  the    pen I turned a r o u n d and saw him,                    h e N ^ a s f s 1umped over     the barrier

                  _and
                    _ a p p e a r e d to  be dead.
                                       ------------            I would describe inim as a white male?                     middle

                  this    person.       I cannot          recollect       now an y of his         clothing.

                  The barrier        I have m e n t i o n e d was         p ositioned on the           left of       pen 4 near

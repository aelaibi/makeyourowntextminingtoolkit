way,    and         in a l l     of    them       I    could          see    supporters               drinking               but        they       were

other       fans.

of    the      tunnel          I went       to    my        left       and    into P e n         4.             At    the      time          ot

entering            Pen    4    there       was       already          a     large       number            of     people           in     the       pen,

          however          you     could          still     move       around.                     I went    and       stood       to    the       left       of

          the    goal        and      about        fifteen           feet       away          from    the    wall,       at       this       time    I was

          not    subjected              to    arty    crush          and    felt          comfortable             standing.




          At    2.45pm          (1445)        I became           aware          of       an       increase       in    the    number          of    people

          in    the    pen       as     the       space     was       becoming                more    restricted,             I was          being

          crushed          by    people           from    all        sides       and          I began       to    fear       for    my       safety.

          All    of    a     sudden          there       was     a    terrific                surge       forward       and       I was       carried

          about       ten       feet     and       became        crushed             against          the    barrier.               Around          me    I

          could       see       that     people          involved           in       the          crush    were       becoming          distressed

          and    shouting             for     help.            However           other             supporters          who    could          not    see

          what       was     h a p p e n ing       co nt i n u e d     to       sing          and    chant.




          At    about        3.00pm          (1500)       I had        become             bent       ov^r^Ene          barrier and             could

     ps

          shouting           for      help.           Because          of       the       position          I was       in    I was unable                to

          see    people          climbing            over      the     railings.                    When    I    looked       to    my       right        I

          saw    a man          who     I would          describe           as       a    white       m a l e aged       about          62    years,

          about       5 ’7      t a i l , grey        h a i r b a 1 d 1 n g o n ty r p , w e a r i n g                 red    jumper,

  V' h e l p         him     but      the     sheer       weight           of    the          crush       prevented          me    from       moving.

 k*       All    I could           do    was       watch.

                                 I too        found       it     difficult                to       breath    and       was    coming          very

          close       to     passing          out     and      in     fact       for          a    short    second       I blacked             out,

          a    man    standing           in       front     of       the    barrier                I was    crushed          against          somehow

When       I    look       to    see       how    the       gentleman             stand       on       my    right       was,        I    could

see       that       he    had       now    slipped          below       the       crush          and       was    lying       lifeless              on

the       floor.            Behind          me    I could          hear       people          shouting             to    get       him     up

h e ’s     dying,          I managed             to    grab       his    hand       and       I    could          see    other           people

trying          to    pull       him       up*    at    this       point          I lost          my    grip       of    his       hand     and       I

cannot          recall          what       happened          to    h im,      this       was       at       about       the    time        the

At    about          3.15pm          (1515)       I felt          the    crush          starting             to    ease,       however           I

was       still       pinned          against          the       barrier          for    sometime.                  Eventually              1 was

able       to    move       backwards             and       even    though          the       pressure             had       been        realised

I was       still          having          difficulty             breathing.                  A    man       standing          next        to    me

told       me    to       hang       onto    him       until       I could          breath             again.            It    took        me

about       five          minutes          before       I    could       breath          properly             again,          however           I did

not       fully       recover          until          some       time    after          I had          left       the    ground.




As    I    looked          down       towards          the       pitch     the      scene          was       one    of       absolute

chaos,          people          were       still       in    a    great       deal       of       distress          and       bodies        were

scattered             along          the    side       lines,       I    could          see       farts      Police          and    ambulance

officers             attempting             to    give       resuscitation                to       a    number          of    injured

people.               I could          see       fans       removing          advertising                   boards       and       using        them

as    stretchers                to    ferry       the       injured.




I made          my    way       to    the    front          of    the    pen       and    w ent out           onto       the        pitch        via

the       exit       gate       which       was       now    open.            I    knew       rny f a t h e r       was       in th e       West

pitch       for       ten       minutes          in w h i c h      time       I noticed                many       grown       men        crying

over       loved          ones,       two    of       which       I tried          to    comfort.                  I then          went     back

into       one       of    the       side    terraces,             minutes          later          over       the       public           address

was    at    around          4 . 0 0 p m . <1600).             Supporters               filed        out       of    the       ground                many

agrieved          and       some       reduced        to     tears,             I noticed            a    line       of       Policemen

and    women       and       upset          supporters            were shouting               at     them      and        blaming               them

for    what       had       happened™I stood                 by            one     of    the       gates       by        the       ground            as

I had       previously             arranged           to     meet     my    father            here after             the       match.                     I

waited       for    half         an        hour     and     there     was        no s i g n     of      him.             There       was

still       supporters             leaving           the     ground        at     this     time          and    to       my    right             side

1 could       see       a    screen          and     I knew        people        were      either             dead       or    receiving

m e d i c a 1 t r e a t m e nt         b e h i nd    it .




At    this    point          1 left          where        I was     w a i t i n g to          walk back             to    the       car         as

there       was    no       sign       of    my            dad. As     I was       walking           past a          shop          I heard                a

call     from      behind          and       my      f a t h e r carne r u n n i n g       up      to    me    and        gave       me         a        big

hug    and    we    both         went        back     to    the     c ar    unable         to      come        to    terms          with             what

had    taken       place.




I would       like          to   add        that     after     the     crush         had      eased           slightly             and          I was

able    to    stand          up,       I    noticed,        one     Policemen            telling              people          to    make

themselves          sick          in       order     to     prevent        them      choking             on    their          own    vomit.

 1                                           Tuesday, 7th October, 1997
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    I have received your what you call
 3        provisional submissions on James Aspinall yesterday.       I
 4        have read them.    The first concern seems to be, as I
 5        understand it, about Detective Constable Fox and for some
 6        reason or other, which at the moment I do not know,
 7        although his presence in the statement appears to be as an
 8        addendum on the file
 9   MRS. ASPINALL:   That's correct, yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    What he was saying was not read out
11        at the mini-inquest?
12   MRS. ASPINALL:   No.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    Not surprisingly, you want to know
14        why that is?
15   MRS. ASPINALL:   Absolutely, yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:    The answer is I do not know why
17        that is.    It may have just been an oversight, it may have
18        been something worse, but I cannot at the moment see quite
19        why anybody should want to suppress the fact that he had
20        done his best to .resuscitate your son.
21   MRS. ASPINALL:      I don't accept he done his best to resuscitate
22        James because, as you see on the summary there that I've
23        gave in to you, my questions were, and I was still asking
24        them in 1991 I think it was, who helped my son on the last
25        minute of his life.     I got a letter back from my Steering
26        Committee when I wrote to them to ask, I received a letter
27        back to say from the Coroner that all he's knows is two
28        supporters helped him, but he doesn't know who.
29             What I'm trying to if P.C. Fox is supposed to have
30        helped James, as he said he did, why was that not even
31        mentioned from my Steering Committee from the Coroner?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not know, it is a good
33        question.
34   MRS. ASPINALL:    It is a very good question and it is a question
35        I want answering.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I will try and find out the


                                       2
 1          answer.
 2   MRS.   ASPINALL:   I also -- Fox -- this came to light to me only
 3          a couple of weeks ago when I sent for photographs and           my
 4          son is laying on the pitch with his arms spread-eagled,
 5          nobody helping him at all.          I have got what photograph, if
 6          you would like to see it, here.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Where did you get that from?
 8   MRS. ASPINALL:     I sent for that from his mini-inquest, numbers
 9          of photographs.      That     it is all I have had.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         You have now had the body    file in
11          this case, have you?
12   MRS. ASPINALL:     Yes.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Was that part of the body file?
14   MRS. ASPINALL:     No, I sent for them separate.         I remember
15          asking Phil to help me along with my mini-inquest.             Is
16          that correct, Phil.
17   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        Yes.
18   MRS. ASPINALL:     I said I'd like photographs, any photographs at
19          all of James in the pen, which I thought there really was
20          photographs of James in the pen a_nd this happened to come
21          along with the photographs of James on the pitch.          It's a
22          photographer's photograph and i t 's got nobody with James,
23          as I'm trying to explain to you, on the pitch no-one at
24          all kneeling by James, no-one doing anything at all to
25          help my boy.   Apparently he was brought on to the pitch, at
26          28 minutes past 3 and he was supposed to have been
27          pronounced dead at quarter to four in a gymnasium.             That
28          to me is only a matter of minutes.
29               I would like to go who played God with James because
30          the photograph I've got you can.'t see the head of this
31          policeman, but he's ready to throw a coat over James.               He
32          made a statement in the body file, this is how it came to
33          light.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Which?
35   MRS. ASPINALL:     P.C. Fox.       There's a statement of his in the
36          body file that I came across and it's in 1990 he made this


                                            3
 1          statement, March 1990, which is a year later, and he
 2          picked up:     "Oh, that was me on that photograph,      I tried
 3          to resuscitate James."        I'm supposed to believe that.        I
 4          d o n 't .
 5                  So I asked my solicitor, Ann Atherton, to send for
 6          his original statement, and I don't know whether you have
 7          got the copy, but this---
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I have only got what you have sent
 9          me.
10   MRS. ASPINALL:       This is what we received back when I had asked
11          for his original statement and he said it doesn't sort of
12          mention James,        I don't need the original statement because
13          James is not mentioned: on it, which I find very---
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          This is the statement of 15th
15          March, is it.
16   MRS. ASPINALL:       Yes.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          We have got that now?
18   MRS.    ASPINALL:    You've got that now, have you, yes.
19   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: What he is dealing with          in that
20          statement is principally about Mr. Pemberton.           That is
21          right, is it not?         Perhaps you do not call it to mind.
22          In that statement he says:           "Further to my statement of
23          16th October regarding Roy Pemberton, number 65, I wish to
24          say..." then he deals with that.          Then at the end he says:
25           "Prior to carrying Mr. Pemberton across the pitch I tried
26          revive two casualties, one of these I covered over with my
27          tunic when I realised he was dead.          This person was dealt
28          with by P.C. Grant, who found my tunic."
29                  Then in his statement, which you were originally sent
30           I think, were you, the later statement?
31   MRS.    ASPINALL:     In James' body file, yes, of 1990.
32   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        He deals with that in much more
33          detail.      Right?
34   MRS. ASPINALL:        Yes, but that statement was given in 1990.          I
35          mean I know y o u 're talking about Roy Pemberton's statement
36           of 89 but there's not an original one about James in 89.


                                             4
 1        He made that statement for James in 1990.
2    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I do not know, I would suspect that
 3        there probably is, there may be an earlier statement.           It
 4        would be surprising if there was not anything earlier than
 5        1990.
 6   MRS. ASPINALL:       In that letter it said there's no connection to
 7        James at all.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What happened?
 9                        Is that statement by Fox, is that the one that
10        you have got after the main inquest?
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      After the main inquest?
12   MRS. ASPINALL:       The mini-inquest was not mentioned, was it?
13                        Fox's statement had not been mentioned at all.
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Let us just get the dates.   I am
15        not sure I have got the date on this as a matter of fact.
16        This is 19th April 1990 and at that stage we know we have
17        got      a---
18   MRS. ASPINALL:       It was just before the main inquest, Mary,
19        April and the main inquest was in the April and he made
20        that statement in the March.
21                        He is mentioning there information regarding
22        James that was not brought up at the mini-inquest.
23   MRS. ASPINALL:       And yet just before the main inquest he is
24        mentioned, he has made a statement.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It may be that this did not come to
26        light.    I would expect there to have been a statement from
27        Fox contemporaneous with this disaster, which probably did
28        not identify the people concerned because, as you probably
29        know, what was happening was that police officers and
30        other people were trying to resuscitate people, taking
31        them to the first aid place and that time of course they
32        did not know who on earth they were dealing with.        It is
33        only subsequently that it was possible to trace, often by
34        means of photographs and videos and so on, who the people
35        were.
36   MRS. ASPINALL:       Excuse me, can I just correct you on that a


                                         5
 1        little bit please, because they knew.       If you look into
 2        James'   files (and I should have brought it with me) they
 3        knew who James was very early on because he had his ID on
 4        him and a picture of James as well.
 5      D JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They may have known, I am sure they
 6        knew that and he was identified I imagine at some stage
 7        too, was he not, I cannot remember precisely when.
 8      . ASPINALL:      He was identified by my husband the following
 9        morning, but they knew who James was when he was brought
10        on to the pitch because he had his ID on him.
11        Straightaway, they took it out of his pocket.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      All I am saying is that any police
13        officer who was trying to give him first aid or was
14        carrying him across the pitch would not necessarily know
15        who he w a s .
16                   :   But would you not have expected that
17        information to come to light prior to the mini-inquest?
18        Would you have expected the mini-inquest to have taken
19        that information into account?
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Yes, I think I .probably would.
21   ______________ ;    It didn't because D.C. Fox is —   that is what
22        we are getting at.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I am trying to see what it is that
24        I have got to try and discover and at the moment it seems
25        to me there is a question as to why, when the addendum to
26        the file was made and why P.C. Fox's evidence was not
27        given at the Inquiry.       There may be a perfect sensible,
28        rational       answer to that.   It may be that nobody knows the
29        answer to it now.
30                       Were the policemen not us,ing pocket books on.
31        that day?
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       No, I do not think they were using
33        pocket boo ks .     What they were asked to do when they got
34        back to the police station or wherever it was they were
35        asked to write out a statement in their own handwriting or
36        written of what they had done that day.        Those statements


                                           6
 1       were then submitted to somebody in the South Yorkshire
 2       Police, who looked through them and, if I use the word
 3       editing it does not necessarily mean that what was done
 4       was improper.      This is something that I am proposing to
 5        look into.    In certain cases there were some alterations
 6       to the statements, mostly they are of, the ones I have
 7        seen have been totally insignificant.     Others, matters of
 8        comment and opinion have been excluded, but these are
 9        questions which I am proposing to look into.
10             I have no reason to suppose that that happened in
11        this particular case but, again, it is something that one
12        can look into.     But really I think what we need to look,
13        at, Chris, is any statement by Fox, which must be
14        somewhere. Then we need to find out how it came about that
15        the addendum was made to the file and was not referred to
16        at the inquest.     Those seem to be the principal questions.
17   MRS. ASPINALL:    They are the principal questions and also my
18        other principal question is the two times of death.      I
19        know that it says on one:     "At 3.45 in a gymnasium" and
20        then I think it was corrected to 3.54.     I do not accept
21        that somebody can say 3.45 and —     I have looked for the
22        original Tetter and I cannot find it but I will carry on
23        looking for it, "Oh it was a typing error."
24             I always thought inquests to me are about what you
25        said yesterday, the time they died, where they died, why
26        they died and to me what caused their deaths.      I know why
27        my son died but that's the only answer I've got.      He died
28        because he happened to be unfortunate enough to be at
29        Hillsborough.     Any other questions I have got no answers
30        to really as far as the correct timing of James' death.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I suspect you will not get that
32        answer.     You cannot get that answer because, as I tried to
33        explain, when a time of death is certified is it certified
34        at a particular time.     All it means is that at that
35        particular time this person was dead, they may have been
36        dead for two years, they may have been dead for two


                                       7
 1          minutes or half a minute.      It is not possible to tell.
 2          Obviously in all these cases where they were certified
 3          dead at 3.54 or 3.45 or whatever it is they had died
 4          within a relatively short time beforehand.
 5   MR.    ASPINALL:    We've had people, we don't know who these
 6          people are basically, going round taking be people's
 7          pulses and things saying they're dead.        We don't know who
 8          they are.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        They were doctors.
10   MR.    ASPINALL:    I do not believe it.
11   MRS.   ASPINALL:    No, I do not believe that.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The doctors certified---
13   MRS. ASPINALL:      I am sorry.    Excuse me, sir, but I am sorry, I
14          do not accept that and will not accept that and I will not
15          go away until these questions are        all answered.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am sorry but the certification of
17          death was—
18   MRS. ASPINALL:      We're talking about our child and he means so
19          much to us and he still means so much to us that I will
20          not--
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Of course.
22   MRS. ASPINALL:      It's all right.       I'm sorry, sir, but —   there's
23          a man there, Dr. Bull who certified James dead at a
24          quarter to four.    My God, he must have been an absolute
25          miracle man for what he done.        He must have been
26          absolutely a miracle man.      The Bionic Man couldn't have
27          done more than what he's done.         He was helping other
28          people, he certified how many people dead, he was in the
29          gymnasium at the other end of the pitch.         All by a quarter
30          to four.
31   _______________:    He has given evidence in his statement that
32          says at twenty to he was at one and doing all sorts and
33          then later on he's supposedly to have certified James dead
34          at quarter to, which is five minutes.         If you read his
35          statement the amount of stuff that's in there that he's
36          done within those five minutes is unbelievable.


                                           8
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did Dr. Bull give evidence at the
 2        inquest?
 3   MRS. ASPINALL:      No, I don't know about that, did he?
 4   PROFESSOR SCRATON:      I think we are seeing in a nutshell the
 5        kind of issues that you would expect to be raised and
 6        dealt with by a thorough inquest into a single person's
 7        death.       I understand the dynamics of an inquest into
 8        multiple deaths, especially when you move to the generic
 9        p ha s e .
10                If we just go back over some of the issues that have
11        been raised now we have a series of anomalies over the
12        evidence which presumably would have been resolved had
13        those individual police officers and others related to the
14        circumstances of James's death been in that situation
15        called.
16                Then we move on to an issue which clearly to any
17        bereaved family has got to be central to the death which
18        is the pronouncement of life extinct.       To any lay person,
19        non-medical person, Dr. Bull's achievements, if that is
20        the right phrase, in 25 minutes defy credibilityr he
21        pronounced 20 people dead in that time, one of whom
22        happens to be James.
23                Again you would expect that an inquest that was going
24        to be thorough and detailed would enable the family to
25        discuss the circumstances in which James's life was
26        pronounced extinct.
27                I think that the anxiety that you are seeing here is
28        quite clearly the fact that in the statement he does make
29        the claim that he went to all of these people, some of
30        whom had identification on them, some of whom didn't.
31        Some of whom, I guess, were later identified from
32        photographs and in this very short period of time managed
33        to do a detailed pronouncement.
34                I think that one of those issues would be
35        problematic, but when you are actually dealing with a
36        whole series of issues, a whole series of unanswered


                                         9
 1       questions what I can see almost happening here is a kind
 2       of latter day re-run of the inquest that should have
 3       happened all those years ago.
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What troubles me a bit about this
 5       is supposing I were to say we should have a fresh inquest
 6        in relation to his particular death?         The people who gave
 7        evidence before or gave statements before would presumably
 8        say,   "Well I c a n 't remember anything about this, I gave a
 9        statement at the time, all I said in my statement is true
10        to the best of my recollection."?
11               Maybe we should see Dr. Bull and take up this
12        question of how he did it.          I do not at the moment quite
13        see how even if we did have another inquest in this case
14        we are going to get any nearer.
15               We   know that .he was certified dead at that    particular
16        time, as far as I can see there         is no reason to think that
17        that is     not the case.   I do not believe anybody will be
18        able to     establish that Dr. Bull     was wrong about it.   So we
19        are dealing with the time between when he was removed from
20        the pen to three forty-five or three fifty-three, whatever
21        the period is.
22   MRS. ASPINALL:     Excuse me interrupting again, but I've got a
23        photograph here, I'd like you to look at this photograph,
24        as you say they don't know who removed my son, how he got
25        onto the pitch at twenty-eight minutes past three or
26        twenty-seven minutes past three.          I have got to take into
27        my head now and really believe what these people have said
28        and you are believing it yourself.          This picture clearly
29        shows to me no one helped my boy, no one was with my son
30        when he was lying on that pitch and I've got this
31        policeman ready to throw a coat over him and you tell me
32        to accept that and my son was pronounced dead at a quarter
33        to four, I will never accept it and I will not go away.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What is the time of this picture?
35   MRS. ASPINALL:      Conveniently enough there's no time on that
36        picture.


                                         10
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Which is your son?
 2   4RS. ASPINALL:     Number 9.   This is a policeman who came to
 3        light to turn round and say he tried to resuscitate my
 4        son, well, why isn't he in the recovery position?       Why was
 5       my son not taken straightaway to an ambulance that was
 6        waiting outside?    That was his right and it's still my
 7        right now to get the answers to this.     Absolutely human
 8        negligence.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Where did you get this photograph
10        from?
11   MRS. ASPINALL:     I sent for it from the mini-inquest file, I got
12        the number that was on Ja m e s 's mini-inquest and yet tha t's
13        the policeman, Fox, who's still not mentioned in James's
14        inquest.     I find that--
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Which do you say is Police
16        Constable Fox?
17   MRS. ASPINALL:     He says - not us, he says in his statement, not
18        us.     The one ready to throw the coat over him.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It looks as though there is an
20        ambulance man or a police officer behind him.       This person
21        here.
22   MRS. ASPINALL:     That's no good to me, is it?     He's seeing to
23        somebody else.     He's over another person, sir, he's not
24        seeing to James.
25                      You cannot just assume from a photograph that
26        that person has been treating James.
27   MRS. ASPINALL:     Taking him in there and taking his alcohol
28        level and never took none of the drivers' that day, just
29        the passengers.
30   PROFESSOR SCRATON:,    I think the great irony of all this is that
31        although much of what we are hearing already seems to be
32        outside, not necessarily in this case, but we have been
33        hearing over the last few days, would technically, maybe,
34        appear to be outside of the remit of your Scrutiny.        It
35        has actually taken your Scrutiny and the announcement of
36        that Scrutiny to bring about the release of all this


                                       11
 1       information.
2              I think t h a t 's the great irony that now people are
 3       receiving information for the very first time and Mr. and
 4       Mrs. Aspinall, in particular, have only just begun to
 5       receive basic information,     information that we would have
 6       expected would have been made available years ago.
 7             So in one sense the weight of your Scrutiny has
 8        convinced the South Yorkshire police that may be some of
 9       this material should be released.       But then once they have
10        that information much of the information appears to be
11        outside the tighter remit or the potential tighter remit
12        of the Scrutiny of evidence.      But it is new evidence to
13        the families.
14             I think again we are seeing that very, very clearly
15        in relation to this material.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   I think that is so and I am glad in
17        the sense that at any rate the fact that the Scrutiny is
18        taking place has produced this material.      Certainly I was
19        told by the police that anybody who asked for their body
20        files they would get them.
21   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   The problem is that if the material that is
22        released comes up against a kind of closed alley, that in
23        fact it raises more questions than your Scrutiny can
24        answer.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   It may do.
26   PROFESSOR SCRATON:   That's is a very serious issue because
27        obviously then we have to deal with the back wash of that.
28        Where does that leave the families if information that
29        they receive now is both conflicting and contradictory?
30        Here we've got a very clear case but then potentially is
31        outside of the remit of your Scrutiny.
32             I think this was one of the key issues that has been
33        raised over and again about how far you feel personally
34        that Scrutiny can go because this is clearly fresh
35        evidence as far as the families are concerned.      Again, it
36        goes back to the nub of the problem that had they been


                                       12
 1          preparing as an individual family for a thorough inquest
2           where the evidence would have been put, all of the
 3          relevant evidence would have been put to the court and
 4          they would have had the opportunity to cross-examine it
 5          and much of this would have avoided years ago.         That is a
 6          crucial issue.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         That may be so, but you were
 8          represented at the time by Mr. Frazer, is that right?
 9   MRS. ASPINALL:      Harris and it was him, yes.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         As I understand it Mr. Frazer
11          accepted on behalf of the families this procedure of these
12          mini-inquests and the way it was done.
13   MR.    ASPINALL:     He's led us up the garden path because he's
14          supposed to be the solicitor, as you're saying, but he's
15          led us up the garden path in. that sense, hasn't he?        We're
16          only ordinary people, we don't anything about the law.
17   MRS. ASPINALL:       I know a lot more about the law now, Jimmy.
18   MRS. STEELE:       We were very trauraatised ordinary people, as
19          well, at the time.
20   MRS. ASPINALL:       We did get told at the mini-inquest that any
21          questions you want to ask you will be able to ask them at
22          the main inquest and we were not allowed as families
23          really.
24   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Is that on the transcript that you
25          have given me?
26   MRS.    ASPINALL:    I don't think so.
27   LORD    JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      A number of people   have saidthis
28          to me but at the moment I have not picked        this up.   I have
29          asked Miss Adlington to identify where this is said.          That
30          might be something that you could help on?
31   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I will.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am constantly told that the
33          families were misled by the Coroner about this and if that
34          is so then I should like to see it.
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:       I attended the mini-inquest and the generic
36          inquest and if I didn't attend every single day then one


                                           13
 1         of the researchers did and that was certainly very clearly
 2         the impression that was given to the families over and
 3         again, that these questions would be dealt with at the
 4         next stage.     I guess we will find that peppered around
 5         many of the
 6         mini-inquest transcripts.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I can look through this one and see
 8         if I can find it in this one, I can look through some
 9         others but it would assist me if you could draw my
10         attention to that.
11   MR.   BONE:     We have full transcripts of all the inquests, main
12         and mini, we've got the lot so we can check it out.
13   MRS. ASPINALL:      I believe that's where these verdicts have got
14         to be squashed on inquest alone for the simple reason I do
15         remember first day of the generic inquest when Dr. Popper
16         stated,    "We must treat this like a car crash", correct me
17         if I'm wrong and I thought,       "My God, I wish it was a car
18         crash", because I know then my son would have definitely
19         gone to hospital and got--
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Yes, I have in mind the passage
21         that you are talking about.       What he said was that in the
22         ordinary way if it was a car crash he would not trace the
23         events step by step from the car crash to the death, but
24         in many cases in fact he attempted to do that.
25                 The complaint now is two-fold, indeed it is a
26         complaint which was made at the Divisional Court and
27         throughout,    (a) that he should not have done it like that,
28         he should have had oral evidence, and,       (b) that the
29         summary in certain respects is not accurate.        The first
30         one I think was rejected by the Divisional Court not least
31         on the basis that Mr. Frazer accepted it and agreed to it.
32         Therefore, the Coroner could not be criticised for doing
33         it and also on the basis that the Coroner is entitled to
34         decide how the evidence arises.
35                 I have made it plain I am afraid I cannot reverse the
36         Divisional Court's ruling on that, I can only look at what


                                        14
 1         is said to be fresh evidence to see whether it bears on
2          that decision and other decisions of the courts.          I will
 3         certainly investigate these points that you have raised
 4         toda y .
 5                       There is a lot of other evidence that doesn't
 6         match.
 7   MRS. ASPINALL:      No, I've gone into that and I found that okay.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: I am afraid we have not paid much
 9         attention to you, Mrs. Steele.         You have got a further--
10   MRS. STEELE:      Yes.
11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I am not sure that I have time to
12         deal with this.      I will read this.     Thank you very much
13         for putting it together and the material which you refer
14         to is in bundle, is it?
15   MRS. STEELE:      Yes, it is.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Thank you very much indeed.     If I
17         need to come back to you I will do so.
18   MRS. STEELE:      Can I just make one point, this morning Miss
19         Adlington had a 'phone call from South Yorkshire police
20         saying that a Charge Nurse Batty has refused to release
21         his statement to us.       The same Charge Nurse Batty had been
22         interviewed for a book called,         "The Day of the'
23         Hillsborough Disaster" written by Rogan Taylor and there
24         was a lot of material used in that book, so I am wondering
25         why he can't release his statement to us.          We believe he
26         had dealings with our son.          This has just come to light
27         lately but according to South Yorkshire police he will not
28         release his statement to us.
29   MR.   BONE:      I have read,   "The Day of the Hillsborough
30         Disaster", and it contains lots of accounts of what
31         happened on the day by people who were involved.          I don't
32         think the accounts are actual statements made to the
33         police, they are just things they wrote down in later
34         years when Taylor approached them to write the book.          It's
35         not quite the same as Batty allowing his statement to be
36         used in Taylor's book and then not allowing you to see it.


                                          15
 1
 2   MRS. STEELE:     What I am asking is what is in the statement that
 3         he doesn't want us to see?
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       What is the name of this gentleman?
 5         Mr. Batty?
 6   MRS. STEELE:     Yes.
 7   MR.   BONE:    Charge Nurse Batty.
 8   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       B-A?
 9   MRS. STEELE:     T-T-Y.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Maybe I shall be able to look at
11         his statement, in fact I will be able to read it.          I do
12         not know why he does not.         Sometimes people just are
13         bloody minded, sometimes they just feel they do not want -
14         any more aggro.      There are all sorts of reasons why they
15         will not release it.      But I think there is a problem so
16         far as the police are concerned about releasing statements
17         in which consent is not given if they were not part of the
18         record of the inquest.       But that does not stop me looking
19         at them.
20   MRS. STEELE:      Are we allowed to ask who actually signed the
21         death certificates because I have a big, big problem with
22         that.
23   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Is that not on the---
24   MRS. STEELE:      I am told by Dr. Calder that Dr. Duncan certified
25         Philip dead.       When I look at Dr. Duncan's statement he is
26         actually dealing with two middle-aged men.          Philip was
27         only 15 years old and was a very young looking 15 years
28         old.
29   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        You might be aware that in this particular
30         case Philip went to hospital and so it raises a different
31         dimension to many of the other deaths.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Was this the Northern General
33         Hospital?
34   MRS. STEELE:      Yes.
35   PROFESSOR SCRATON:        Again, what is it clear, and it only just
36         beginning to be clear, is that there are significant


                                          16
 1   contradictions within the statements that were made by the
2    doctors at the hospital in the process.    Even given the
 3   confusion and distress, that no doubt everybody at the
 4   hospital was under, again it is the problem that
 5   statements end up in bundles which end up in body files,
 6   which, as I said to you on another case, end up cast in
 7   stone when in actual fact when you read those statements
 8   they're certainly debateable and certainly open to
 9   question.    I think that's one of the major concerns here
10   because the actual, you can understand why, because Philip
11   was one of only a few people who actually got to hospital,
12   which meant that he was alive and perhaps had some chance.
13
14           In that case it becomes even more significant not
15   that, I would want to put that in any hierarchy, but it
16   becomes even more significant that the context in which he
17   died is examined very carefully.     Did he receive the
18   appropriate treatment as quickly and efficiently as he
19   might?     I think that again it is not about families
20   wanting to apportion very specifically blame, it is about
21   wanting to know the reliability of the evidence and the
22   process through which their loved ones went in order to
23   get there.
24           I think that is the different dimension in this
25   particular case because we're talking here about the
26   quality of care from the moment that Philip was removed
27   from the pen right the way through to him being pronounced
28   dead.     I think that one of the problems here is that I
29   would like to signal, you know it is already in my own
30   personal submission, is the issue around medical evidence
31   and the issue of reliability.     The assumption being that
32   the Coroner stated that once people had received those in
33   juries they would have died anyway.     This is a very good
34   example of a case where not necessarily would they have
35   died anyway, death is a continuum.
36           We have cases where obviously two people were left in


                                  17
 1         a vegetative state, other people regained consciousness 24
 2         hours later.     So the question of the quality of care that
 3         Philip received in those circumstances is absolutely
 4         crucial and, again, the statement just don't match.
 5   MRS. STEELE:    They won't release the medical records to me
 6         unless I sign that I'm not going to take an action against
 7         them.
 8   LORD JUSTICE. STUART-SMITH:     You are not prepared to do that?
 9   MRS. STEELE:    Well, I want to know about it first because I
10         want to what they're hiding.      That sounds like a threat to
11         me when I receive a letter like that.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They will release the records to
13         me.
14   MRS. STEELE:      Thank you.
15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      There may not be a lot on them,    I
16         am afraid,    I have seen some of these medical records, they
17         are almost non-existent.
18   MRS. STEELE:      I have also got a statement from the policeman at
19         the gymnasium saying that at ten past five he was told to
20         receive body number 82, which was Philip, and then he was
21         —   he later made another, he made two further statements
22         to"say:     "No, he had made a mistake in the timing" because
23         if that was the case I want to know why we were sitting,
24         the three of us, my husband, we were at the match also,
25         three of us, Les, myself and our youngest son, aged 13,
26         were sitting outside that hospital morgue door between 8
27         and 9 p.m. waiting to go and see Philip and then a
28         policeman came out and said:      "No, there were bodies
29         there, they were back at the gymnasium."      I want to know
30         how come that P.C. was told at 10 minutes past 5 that he
31         was to expect body number 82.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I do not know that I shall be able
33         to provide answers to all these questions but I will try
34         to provide answers to some of them.
35   MR.   ASPINALL:     Can I say something.   It's nothing to do with
36         the actual points, but James was a very good boy and I


                                        18
 1         feel as if I've had no justice whatsoever.        He went to a
2          game, done everything right and come back five days later
 3         in a coffin.     I feel as if nothing has been done
 4         whatsoever and I think a lot of people have been telling
 5         lies and nothing will change my mind over it.
 6   MRS. ASPINALL:      I feel exactly the same.     I think it's been a
 7         complete whitewash, a complete cover-up.
 8   MR.   ASPINALL:     I'm a very bitter person.
 9   MRS. STEELE:      They were tested for alcohol--
10   MRS. ASPINALL:     May I say to you and quote a saying from Martin
11         Luther King and I will quote it to you:        "Injustice
12         anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere."
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.
14   MR.   ASPINALL:     Can I interrupt again.     When one of the main
15         constables was telling lies it must seep down to. other
16         people if he says things like that.        That's all I can say.
17
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You are talking about Mr.
19         Duckenfield lie?
20   MR.   ASPINALL:     Yes, if one of the main fellows is doing it
21         what's going on below him.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      They was a very reprehensible piece
23         of conduct.
24   MRS. ASPINALL:      I will never let it rest, let that be known,
25         until I get the truth about of this.        If I have to go
26         outside this for it I will.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Thank you very much.

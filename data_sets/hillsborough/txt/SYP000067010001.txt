            not    in a n y        way       visible          to    us




            I saw       individuals                being       assisted             to    climb       to    the        upper       stand       and    then

            realised          what       was       happening.                  I    could       not     distinctly                see    the       actions

            of    the    police          in       fvvnt       of    the    stand          but    my i m p r e s s i o n           was    that       they

       S£. did n o t appeart m i b e u n i f i e d                        in       their    fta/Wling             of    the       trouble.            Some

           appeared           to    be       pushing          the       crowd       back    and       some        to    be

           assisting           people             out    of    the       stand.            I saw        other          police          coming       onto

            the    pitch       and       most          went    over       to       the    stand       but     a    posse           took       up

            position          in    front          of    the       North       Stand       apparently              to    prevent             the    people

            getting       on       to    the       pitch.           Some       PCs       were    still        wearing             their       luminous

            jackets.               Soon          the    first       ambulance             was    on     the       ground          I saw       the

            Liverpool          supporters                taking          the       advertisement              hoarding             away       for    make

            shift       stretchers.




            In my       considered                opinion          the    situation             was     absolute             chaos       and       there

            did    not    appear             to    be    any       cohesive          action        by      anyone        to       take       control.

            In    fact    I saw          Tony          Ensor        a    Liverpool          Director              and    a    fellow          solicitor

            walking       to       the       scene       of    the       trouble          with                          irison t h e          General

            part    in    the       proceedings.                        I saw       Ken    Dalgleish              go    on

            to    the    pitch          but       did    not       hear    any       announcements                 over       the       tannoy       of    any

            sort.




            I have       no    doubt             that    the       police          had    apparently              little          or    no    control

            over    what       was       happening             and       being       unaware          of    the        Sheffield             Wed.

           arrangements                 or        organisation                 cannot       give        any       opinion          as    to    their

            part    in    the       matter.




            I also       criticise                the    Referee          for       having       started           the       game       and    not

             stopping          it    immediately              it    should       have     been      obvious         that    the       breakdown

             there       was    serious           trouble          in    the    Liverpool

             supporters             part    of     the      ground.




             I left       the       gr o u n d   at    a b o ut     3.40       ( 1540)    with      my    friends         from    there

             to   Live r p o o l .          A     PC   at     our       exit    told     us    that      he   had    heard       of

             5    fatalities           at   which        we    were       horrified           and   on    the   car       radio       we    later

             heard       of    the     increasing             number.

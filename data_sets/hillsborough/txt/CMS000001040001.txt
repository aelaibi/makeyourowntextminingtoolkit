LETTER FROM SIMON HUGHES MP

Mr Patterson of F8 has passed me your note of 26 November
about Mr Hughes'   letter of 10 October to the Home Secretary
containing a complaint about the Sheffield coroner involved in
the Hillsborough    disaster.  You asked for a contribution
covering the Hillsborough Inquiry, which is this Division's
responsibility. You may wish   to include something along the
following lines.

Lord Justice Taylor was appointed on 17 April 1989 by   the Home
Secretary to carry out an Inquiry with the following    terms of
references

'To inquire  into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football
ground on 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the
needs of crowd control and safety at sports events. '

He concluded that

1. The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the
disaster was the failure,   when gate C was opened, to cut off
access to the central pens which were already overfull.

2.  They were    already overfull    because  no safe    maximum
capacities had been laid down      (in the   safety certificate
issued by the local   authority), no attempt was made to control
entry to individual      pens numerically and    there was    no
effective visual monitoring of crowd density.

3. When   the influx from gate C entered pen   3, the layout of
the barriers there afforded less protection than it should and
a barrier collapsed. Again,   the lack of vigilant monitoring
caused a sluggish reaction and response         when  the crush
occurred.    The small size and number of    gates to the track
retarded rescue efforts. So,   in the initial stages, did lack
of leadership.

4. The need   to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at
the  turnstiles. That occurred because, as both Club and police
should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope
with  the   large numbers demanded of itunless   they arrived
steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and
police tactics on the day failed to provide for controlling a
concentrated arrival of large numbers should that occur in a
short period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it
did. The presence of an unruly minority who had drunk too much
aggravated  the problem.   So did the     Club's confused and
inadequate signs and ticketing.


In his Interim Report, Lord Justice Taylor quoted from       the
Archbishop of York's sermon at      the Hillsborough Memorial
Service;
"Events of the magnitude of Hillsborough don't usually happen
just for one single reason, nor is it usually possible to pin
the blame on one single     scapegoat .......  Disasters happen
because a    whole series    of mistakes, misjudgements      and
mischances happen to come together in a deadly combination."

He went on     to propose some instant measures capable of
implementation    before the start  of the 1989-90 season,
followed by wide ranging and longer term recommendations in
his Final Report.

The above information has been widely reported and discussed,
and Mr Hughes may well be familiar with it. If you need any
further information, for example on     the operation of the
safety certification legislation, please let me know.

   It has been brought to my attention that the Sheffield Coroner is paid at
   a full time rate but does other jobs.

   I am also troubled by the at least apparent conflict of interests between
   somebody, although Her Majesty's Coroner, who is paid for by the City
   Council, when he is at the same time conducting an Inquest Inquiry into
   the liability of the same City Council.

   I have discussed this matter with my colleague Alex Carlile, Q.C., who shares
   my concern.
   I could set out the details further if this would be helpful and am aware
   that this matter is now a matter of public debate in Committee on Sheffield
   City Council. One of the Liberal Democrat Councillors in Sheffield asked for my
   view on the subject and I said I would write to bring the matter to your
   attention.
   I am happy to discuss the matter with you if this would be the most
   appropriate way to proceed. I should be grateful for a reply as soon
   as possible.

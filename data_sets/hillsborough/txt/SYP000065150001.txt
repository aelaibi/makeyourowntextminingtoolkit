Having        left our home we w a l k e d along M i d d l e w o o d R d , turned                          Lown

Pa r kside Rd,        then]_a long Catchbar Ln,           parallel               to the football

ground        itself.      It was      as we walked along Catchbar                      Ln      and turned!

into Leppings Ln that we noticed a large group of Liverpool

football         supporters.        I knew that the Liverpool                fans were        to be housed

at    the Leppings Ln end               of the ground and           could easily d i s t i n g u i s h them

by virtue         of their    scouse        accents.      We noticed and                commented upon the

large        number   of d is ca r d e d beer    cans,    beer      bottles and some           broken

beer      glasses - similar          to those       provided     by public houses which were

strewn a r o u n d that general             vicinity and       in particular Leppi n g s Ln,

Many      fans were       seen to be drinking           on the i r / w a y to the ground,             from

beer      cans mainly but        some    still      had beer glasses           in their       possession.

Wh e n    I say mainly fans were             drinking,       in the main the m a j o r i t y were

not,      but a significant          number     bearing      in min d the numbers             there were

drinking alcohol.             Some were drinking             from one       container whilst

carrying         two or three       other    cans    in their       other    hands,     all    of these

were males whose ages               ranged    in my opin i o n between            16 yrs and 25 yrs.

The      time    by then w ould      be a pp ro xi m a t e l y 2.40      pm ( 1 w 0   hrs).      We    then

w a l k ed    back along C a t c h b a r Lane       to M i d d l e w o o d Rd And as we        rounded the

corner        onto M i d d l ew oo d Rd we a gain noticed many fans streaming

down Catchbar Ln towards                the Leppings Ln end.                A g a i n a signif i c a n t

number        of these were      seen to be drinking alcohol                   from   cans.      Whe n     I

say streaming           I mean that there was a cons iden^ble                     number      of fans      just

walk i n g      towards    the ground,       most    of whom w e r / z    doing so      in an orderly

fashion.

I then saw a fight break                out between two/fans who had previously                          been

walking         on opposite    sides     of the      road,    but    in the same direction.                    I

am unable         to say w hich team they f o l lowed but                 I assu m e d them to be

Liverpool         fans.

                                                                                                                        S941

           :^ e r y    bravely       I t h o u g h t r a nd the fight was           over within a matter                of

            seconds.           By that     time       1 felt the general            atmosphere        to be t hreatening

            because          of the drink aspect.               I decided against               trying to gain

            adrrsi ttance       to the ground and both of us                     returned home.            We a r r i v e d

            home aro und 2.43             pm       (1445 hrs)     that day.

            A bout 2.50         pm    (1450 hrs)        that    day     I decided to go back along

            M i d d l e w o o d Rd to M id dl ew oo d shops             in order         to get a haircut.             Whilst     I

            was       in the hairdressers              having my hair          cut two         fans burst     into      the

            shop.        One    demanded a hair            c u t r the    other asked where            he might         find a

            good       pub.     They were          both males with Liverpool                   accents and both were

            in high spirits?              ie cocky etc,           sufficiently            so to frighten the            staff.

            I think          the shops     name       is _________________________________                The    staff

            refused to have any dealings with the two and both were                                        r e quested to

            leave w he re u p o n staff             then   pulled the        shutters          down and    closed the

            shop.        Both fans had              left        by that time.

            The       time    by then was           fast        a pp r o a c h i n g 3    pm    (1500 hrs)   and             I was

            listening          to the match           commentary on the            radio       in the shop.        I heard

            news       of what a p p e a r e d to be a pitch              invasion and           feared a riot          of some

            kind as a result.                  I    left        the shop soon             a f t e r w a r d s and by         that tim

            the       streets were        quiet.        I went     straight        home.

                                                                                            '                          bIGNED

             Further           to my previous         st atement      of 4 May       1989 whilst rny wife and               I

             were walking               towards    the Shef f i e 1d W e d n e s d a y Football         Ground,    we

              noticed -a fair few                (30/40)     fans    in the a rea of Catch Bar Lane,                  however

              w hen we         reached the j u n ct ion with L E P P I N G S LANE,             we saw     large     numbers

              of fans          coming     from the       d i rection of W A D S L E Y LANE.        In my view there

              were       literally hundreds              corning down the        road and were such that we had

              to wait          for a gap        in the human traffic            to   cross the     road.

              It was         noticeable         that a significant            number    of the fans were          drinking

              from glasses,              cans,    etc.     but the m a j o r i t y were      behaving     in an orderly

              manner.               The fans were     singing and          in high spirits.           I w o u l d say     it

              was      obvious         t h e y ’d been drinking       but none were          drunk.

Dear Mr Murray

HILLSBOROUGH ASSISTANCE UNIT

Thank you for your letter of 11 December.

I gather there have been discussions involving Cheshire1s Social Services
staff about the level of contribution towards the Disaster Unit.   In the
light of these discussions, it has been agreed by the County Council's
Social Services Committee that Cheshire will underwrite the costs to a
total of £32,000 (representing a contribution of £8,000 towards 1989/90
costs and £24,000 towards the 1990/91 costs).   This provision is being
made from the County Council's budget for the current year, and we will
therefore make arrangements for the payment to be processed as soon as
possible.

This once and for all payment is agreed by the Social Services Committee
as a discharge of Cheshire's obligation to the Unit.   I hope this is
acceptable.


                          Yours sincerely




                          Director, Chief Executive's Office

Deear Mr Murray

HTT.T.SBOROPGH ASSISTANCE UNIT

With reference to your letter dated 11 December 1989 I am able to
confirm that this Council has agreed to funding the unit on the basis
set out in previous correspondence and at the meeting in Liverpool on
September 1989.

No doubt you will let me know in due                           course     what   arrangements          are
proosed for making the actual payment

In case you have not already been informed, this Council also added the
following to its resolution agreeing the funding:

       *•   *   \   h n i - 4.   *.1 ^         <*s+- •?troc*       flio    ftUtilOTltl6S      b©

      informed- that in the opinion of this Council, the regional
      unit should stay in being as a permanent regional unit, but
      should have the word "Hillsborough" removed from its title
       in due course".

Yours sincerely

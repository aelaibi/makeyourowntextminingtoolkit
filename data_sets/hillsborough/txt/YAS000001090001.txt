           - CONTROL OFFICER


Date:   18.4.89

Time:   1500-1525




I had a phone call from Control saying that there had been an incident at
Hillsborough (approx 1530) with fatal injuries and would I come in.

On arrived I was met by Mr Page who directed me into the incident room.
There were problems with the radio communications, I was detailed to listen
into the domestic channel. Both           |and R Clarke made attempts to
rectify the problem.

I received a telephone call from WYMAS (1600?) saying that they were
sending down two vehicles and gave me their call signs.

R Clarke was still having problems so I asked should I listen in with him
to which he said he would like me to take over the position.

I diverted vehicles to Netherthorpe Parkway and Herries Road Garage.

A4 maintained in contact with me by radio to stop ambulances arriving at
the Garage.

A problem then arose with the A4 radio, so I passed a message via a
Derbyshire crew who were making their way there.

A call came from a WYMAS vehicle and I directed him to standby at
Tankersley. WYMAS Majox came on, and after consulting Supt Clarke I
despatched him to scene, because of a request for further body bags, with
Supt Dale looking out for him.

Some confusion arose regarding the mortuary.  Some-one said 'The mortuary's
full' and Station Officer Higgins said it wasn't as he was at the MLC and
nothing was moving.

I maintained radio watch as the incident began to wind down and then
detailed to answer telephone calls from the Press. I left the unit at
approximately 2300.

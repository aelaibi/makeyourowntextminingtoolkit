                      FOOTBALL CLUBS: RELOCATION

1.  At your meeting with the FA and the Premier League on 15 July
Sir John Quinton raised the question of the difficulties some
clubs were experiencing in obtaining planning permission for the
relocation of their grounds. He cited in particular the case of
Southampton. This note summarises the action that has been taken
on this problem and the position, so far as we are aware, in
respect of individual clubs.

Planning Policy Guidance

2.   From the outset it was clear that for some clubs the only way
they could sensibly achieve the aim of all seating would be
through    major redevelopments at their   existing grounds or by
relocating their grounds. In    recognition of this the Department
of the Environment's Planning    Policy    Guidance on   Sport and
Recreation (PPG) issued in September 1991, following consultation
with SARD, contained advice to local planning authorities (LPAs)
encouraging them to be positive in dealing with applications for
planning permission in respect of such proposals. A copy of the
relevant part of the PPG is attached but the main points it makes
are: -

      i)     LPAs were asked   to give sympathetic consideration to
              proposals designed   to achieve the aim of all seated
              accommodation at Football League grounds;

      ii)    there should be   early and close consultation        between
              LPAs and clubs on such pro posa1rv;

      iii)   county councils were asked to consider setting up fora
             of LPA's and clubs to consider strategic sites for new
             stadia;

      iv)    football stadia  issues should be taken into account in
              preparing local plans. Normal planning issues such as
              parking, access etc as well as the extent to which


                                                                         1
          multi-use stadia will be of benefit to the community as
          a whole should be taken into account;

     v)   Green Belt locations would not normally be suitable for
          football     stadia unless justified  by  very  special
          circumstances eg all other practicable options had been
          exhausted and all other considerations had been fully
          a ddresse d.

3.       As a follow up to PPG 17 we sought information from the
Regional Offices of the DOE through one of the DOE HQ Planning
Policy Divisions          on the extent to which the PPG had been
successful in encouraging consultation between LPAs and clubs and
in overcoming particular difficulties. The responses received
from the Regional Offices suggested that generally speaking
discussions were taking place between clubs and their planning
authorities where the clubs wished to relocate although there
were still significant difficulties in some cases in identifying
suitable sites for such large structures. Often the only sites
available are in sensitive areas eg Green Belt and Area of
Outstanding National Beauty. The degree of involvement of the
Regional Offices in these matters varies; but they have to avoid
becoming           too  closely  involved,  particularly  on  specific
pr o p o s a l s ,   because  of  the  Secretary  of  State  for   the
Environment's appellate function on planning applications.

4.  As mentioned above the PPG recommended the setting up of fora
of LPAs and clubs to consider strategic sites for new stadia. The
need for such a forum was highlighted in the recent decision of
the Secretary of State for the Environment to refuse planning
permission for a new ground for Oxford United in the Green Belt
south-east of Oxford. The DOE was not satisfied that all possible
sites and options for the clubs relocation had been recently and
properly examined. The inquiry inspector's recommendation that a
strategic forum of the kind mentioned in the PPG should be set up
to consider Oxford's relocation was therefore referred to in the
Secretary of State's decision letter.

FLA position on relocation

5.  The FLA have a major interest in club's planning difficulties
because these could affect their ability to meet the Taylor
timetable on all seating. In view of this the Chairman of the
FLA, Norman Jacobs, met Mr Yeo (PUSS DOE) in March to discuss the
possibility of speeding up the handling of planning applications
and appeals in respect of stadia development proposals. Mr Yeo
reiterated the PPG advice on early consultation between clubs and
LPAs and said that when appropriate opportunities arose DOE
would encourage LPAs to issue speedier decisions and clubs to
discuss the issues with their LPAs. The DOE have set a target for
LPAs to determine 80% of all applications within the statutory 8
week period.

6.   Following your recent announcement,the FLA's position is
that the August 1994 deadline for 1st and 2nd Division clubs
remains firm. There might, however, be scope for some flexibility

                                                                     2
 if the FLA is satisfied that a club is actively engaged in moving
 to a new ground and has   the necessary financial package in place
 but will narrowly miss the August 1994 deadline because of delays
 over which it has had no control. The FLA would be looking for
 clubs  seeking to   re-locate to demonstrate that it        h ad the
 necessary planning permission, a suitable design, the money to
 proceed and a firm timetable for relocation. A club which has
 neither made   detailed plans    to  relocate   nor developed    its
 existing ground will be refused a licence by the FLA. Where clubs
 have no definite    plans   for relocation or clearly     stand no
 prospect of completing     it anywhere near 1994,    the  FLA will
 require them to meet      the deadline either at their     existing
 grounds or (if they choose) by ground sharing. Clubs which are
 seeking to relocate but have   not yet secured planning permission
'are, therefore, being advised by the FLA to prepare contingency
 plans against the possibility of not being able to relocate by
 1994.

Extent of the problem

7.   Although this    subject has been raised on a number of
occasions, the extent of the problem is probably exaggerated by
the high profile     of one or two hard cases and is          not as
widespread as at one stage might have appeared probable. There
are a number of      clubs   such as Southampton,    Oxford United,
Maidstone,   Bristol Rovers and Southend United where planning
difficulties have generated attention and publicity. But these
form a small proportion of the 93 Premier League and Football
League clubs. The decision to relax the all-seating requirement
for Divisions 2 and 3 clubs will ease the pressure on those
clubs. In addition, not all of the clubs who are having problems,
want to relocate solely in order to achieve all-seating. Oxford
United and Southend United have been thinking about moving for a
number of years, Maidstone's problems arise from selling their
original ground in the town for development and Bristol Rovers
left their ground at Eastville several years ago because they
were unable to negotiate a long enough lease. Other clubs such as
Chester City, Sunderland, Millwall and Huddersfield who are in
the process of building    new grounds or have firm proposals to do
so have    co-operated closely with their      LPAs and have been
relatively free from planning difficulties.

8.    Southampton do appear to have a genuine Taylor related
problem. To convert their ground to all-seating would reduce the
capacity below a viable level. They cannot re-develop the ground
because of the restricted nature of the site and therefore must
move. They have had discussions with Southampton City Council and
Eastleigh BC and after detailed consideration of a dozen or so
sites have    identified    one at Stoneham- which    lies partly   in
Southampton and partly      in neighbouring Eastleigh.      They have
submitted planning applications to both authorities. However, the
site lies in a strategic gap of land separating the built up
areas   of   Southampton    and Eastleigh    and both   Eastleigh   BC
Councillors and Hampshire CC, who own most of the site, are
opposed    to   the  proposal.    Eastleigh  have   refused   planning
permission.   Southampton have not made their decision but the

                                                                     3
Department of Transport have issued a direction preventing the
grant of planning permission because of access difficulties onto
an M27 sliproad. It is now open to the club to appeal to the
Secretary of State    for the Environment against the refusal by
Eastleigh BC and the non-determination of the      application to
Southampton City Council. They have not done so yet. However,
even  if   the  club do  eventually obtain planning permission
Hampshire CC would    still have to agree to sell the land before
the development could go ahead. It is possible therefore that the
clubs and the LPA will be forced into re-considering some of the
other sites previously rejected.

9.   There  is    a further potential problem on the Hampshire
coast. Portsmouth have been refused planning permission to extend
their ground at Fratton Park. They therefore also now need to
relocate but    officers in the City Planning   Department do not
consider that there are any suitable sites within the city.

Conclusion

10.   It is clear that there are two or three clubs which do have
very . serious    problems in terms of finding suitable sites   and
obtaining planning permission for new grounds. However, there
appears to be limited scope for further action by the Government.
Positive advice to LPAs has been issued in the PPG and the DOE
have promised      to do what they can to speed   up decisions. But
decisions on specific proposals are for LPAs and neither this
Department     nor the DOE can intervene because of the Environment
Secretary's appellate function.

11.  However, there may be cases where the FLA becomes aware of
clubs having planning difficulties and where they believe that
neighbouring LPAs may be able to assist in identifying a site. In
these circumstances we will ask the DOE Regional Offices, in
consultation with DOE HQ, to encourage counties to set up fora of
all the interested LPAs and the club to ensure that the question
of an alternative site is considered thoroughly. The FLA is
keeping us informed of all cases of planning difficulty.

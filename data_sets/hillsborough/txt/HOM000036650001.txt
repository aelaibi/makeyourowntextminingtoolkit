 Tfos package is for delivery to Superintendent Alan Hepworth or
 1C Ken Greenway at the South Yorkshire Police Discipline &
 Complaints Department, Windsor Road, Heeley, Sheffield S8 8UB
 Heeley is a suburb on the south side of Sheffield. I attach a map
 showing the way from junction 33 on the Ml via the A57 into
 Sheffield Town Centre.

 The^Discipline & Complaints Dept is at the end of a short part-
cobbled street (Windsor Road) on the right-hand side of the main
road (London Road) coming south out of Sheffield Town Centre.
It is a collection of Portakabins inside a compound and does not
have a sign outside saying what it is. It is hard to see from the main
road - look out for Porcelanosa Tiles, etc, as marked.

  Dear Ms Adlington
  Graham Wright (Deceased)
  Thank you for your letter of the 30th April. I believe that the lack of response from the Police is in
  fact due to an error within my Office for which I must apologise. The same situation appears to have
arisen in respect of Mr Jones’ request for documentation and I am sending Mr Jones a copy of this
  letter together with a covering note.
  When I originally received a note from Mr Jones saying that he had not yet had statements promised
  sometime befor^ I assumed that my request to the Police had got lost within the postal system at
  one end or the other. Such things do happen. However, when I got your letter concerning Mr
  Wright, I felt that there was far too much of a coincidence involved and checked through the system.
  What I £now believe has happened in both these cases is that I have asked a member of my staff to
  pass the request onto PC Greenway with a standard covering letter but, due to a misunderstanding,
  this did not occur. I note that my letter to you of the 27th March was not in fact in a format that I
  would have signed had it been laid before me.
  It is obviously unacceptable that we have made an error in such a sensitive matter and I would be
  grateful if you would accept my apology.
  I have personally ensured that PC Greenway has been made aware of the request today and he has
  promised me that he will deal with it as a priority. If you do not receive the appropriate paperwork
  within (say) F days please telephone me.
  Yours sincerely

Re: HILLSBRQUGH STATEMENTS




Dear Ms Adlington,


Thank you for your letter of 5th March. I am sorry for the delay in replying to you but I
understand you have had a telephone message in the meantime.


Because it appears that the statements do not fall within Rule 57 I have asked the Police
to supply copies from their facilities.


If you do not hear anything within the next two weeks please do not hesitate to contact me
again.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Yours/] faithfully

He:      GRAHAM JOHN              WIGSS (deceased)                No.43.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not* to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection

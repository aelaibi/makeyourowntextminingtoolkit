HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY: FINAL REPORT - POLICE ISSUES


1.   Thank you for copying to Peter Bolton your note of 20
February and draft circular about police charging.  I am
replying in his absence from the office today and tomorrow.

2.   First, our view is that the last sentence of paragraph
210 of the Final Report is consistent with the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 197 5 (the 197 5 Act). We are also content
with the idea of moving towards better stewarding and less
policing.  This point was raised with Lord Ferrers last
November by Mr Fox of the Football League. A copy of the note
of that meeting (paragraph 4 refers) is attached.    See also
the Home Secretary's comments on 29 January (extract from
Hansard attached). Crowd control, by which we mean directing,
marshalling etc and the sort of duties described in paragraph
10(b) of the draft circular is, in our view, a proper part of
crowd safety management for which the club is responsible.
Police presence is, we understand, a backup to normal
stewarding because of the law and order risks associated with
soccer matches in particular.    (Some sports, for example horse
racing already employ private security firms as part of their
crowd control arrangements.)

3.   We are content to encourage local authorities to try to
improve stewarding arrangements at grounds but terms and
conditions of safety certificates which relate to police
presence must reserve the determination of that presence to
the chief officer of police.  Local authorities may not
therefore be in a position to offer "trade-offs" without
police agreement.

Draft circular

4.   We would prefer to delete paragraph 5 of the circular
altogether since charging for the police is linked more
directly to section 15 of the Police Act 1964 rather than
safety certificates which are not necessarily consistent on
the point.  But if you feel that paragraph 5 is important we
suggest it should be amended as attached.

5.    Paragraph 8(c) is awkward.   As mentioned above, if you
mean here that the stewarding arrangements are poor it is up
to the club and the local authority to improve them.    Subject
to F 8 's views we think that the police should not be used for
normal stewarding purposes.    If clubs are not willing to
    ensure to the satisfaction of the certificating authority that
    proper stewards are provided the authorised crowd capacity for
    the ground should be reduced to reflect the ground condition -
    which include the crowd management arrangements as well as the
    structural condition.

    6.   We recommend deletion of paragraph 10(a) and the phrase
    "structural improvements or" in paragraph 11(d) of the draft.
    We do not wish to encourage more pitch barrier fencing which
    poses other safety difficulties and cost implications.

REVISED   paragraph   5



Safety certificates are required for grounds designated by the

Secretary of State under section 1{1) of the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975.     They are issued by local authorities and

contain such terms and conditions as the local authority

consider necessary or expedient to secure a reasonable safety

at the ground.    Where certificates require the holder to

arrange for the attendance of adequate number of police

officers within the ground the extent of the provision of

police services must, under section 2 of the 1975 Act as

amended, be reserved for the determination of the Chief Police

Officer of the force in question.

 NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON 29 NOVEMBER WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE
 FOOTBALL LEAGUE                                             ln£i



 President:   Lord Ferrers                       Mr W Fox
              Mr Mould                           Mr Whalley
              Mr Smith                           Mr A Hutt
              Miss Nicholson



In thanking Lord Ferrers for the meeting Mr Hutt said that it was
oppor tuni tv In* Wh?   °nly recently become President to have the
h a d h a to meet the Minister responsible for the police.    They
had come today to discuss 3 matters:

      1*       implications of the Lord Justice Taylor Report;
           Pitch invasions;.and
      3.   Ticket touting.

   , Mr Fox said that since the Taylor interim report certain
a smalie^T„hX?^tleSCiS? sitYations of over policing.               For example
clnh         ?         v      ^ ep°o1 was bein9 Policed as though: it were, a
      ™                  ' •     York the situation was. thatr even though
         t h e t e r r a c in^.were empty a police officer and a club.
lull I t       e °n dutl in front of: thenv. While it was acknowledged
felt su-r^                ° Lorf Justice Taylor's recommendations Mr Fox
m                 ^       was not meant to operate in this way.
aL            E S n£ed SSfc thffcthe Baylor report > a s based- on a large
               match. The police had taken a pounding in the report
        fh             ?    Were,now being ultra careful.     This of course
that thp       situations which had been referred to. Mr Smith agreed
         „ ?uatlon1^ ch Mr Fox had described was not wh«*Vn Lord
MrFox                ?        have envisaged. Although sympathetic to what
at thi q c=4-a     4- ° ,say    ord Ferrers said that it would be premature
         stage to interfere.           He agreed with what Mr Whalley had
had to s a y a b o u t the police being very careful.       This was very
Mr FoJ a a r S d ewa?h         d?Ubt through time things would settle down.
™                k i                  taken - he certainly hoped things
of hisSconcerns Wanted at this sta<?e fco make L°rd Ferrers aware

        F°^ r^ e?r^d     various matches which had had crowd
t ouble and which he had been involved in making enquiries into
Having looked at the various reports from the police involved in
those matches he had formed the view that there was no uniformity
            ®S * Glv® ^hls situation he asked whether the Home
aivJ"™ ^ S -in a p°slJlon to Put out a circular to chief constables
giving advice on best practice.   While agreeing that this was
          po®slb?;® Lord Ferrers believed it was inadvisable at
     stage, for the reasons he had made earlier, ie, that some



                                                    /time should..

                                      1
time should elapse to see how things proceeded.  Mr Hutt asked
whether Lord Ferrers would welcome evidence from the League early
next year on how things were running.  It was agreed that this
would be useful but Lord Ferrers hoped that the League would look
at the constructive side of things as well as the negative.

4.   Another matter of concern M r Fox said was the number of
police officers now involved as a result of Taylor's interim
recommendations.   He felt that the time was now ripe for clubs to
look to using security firms such as Securior within the* grounds.
He was only too aware of the demands which were placed on the
police and it was not right that there were less police able to
carry out their normal day to day duties because they were
required to attend a football match. Mr Fox said that he did not
envisage that the police would not be involved but simply that the
police presence should be augmented. Mr Smith said that in
general a move to more professional stewarding would be welcomed.
He referred to his experience at: a football match in Glasgow where
a security group- called "Rocksteady" did a wonderful job. M r Hutt
thought that some? consensus; of opinion must exist on hows using: the
police with a security* company would* operate . Lords Ferrers^ <
thought that" if clubs- were? to go down this road it might* be
necessary to provide a code of practice but that a final decision
on this would have to lie with chief officers of police.      However,
he didn't envisage- that the- police would be unco-operative about
this.

5.   Although not related to the implications of the* Taylor
interim report Mr whalley spoke of a new situation which clubs
found themselves in. This was that they were now being charged
for police reserves sitting in vans outside the ground.   The
principle had always been that the clubs paid for those in the
grounds and that the police paid for those outside.   The question
was, Lord Ferrers said, whether those officers sitting in vans
outside the ground were back-up for the police inside.   If they
weren't then Lord Ferrers agreed that the clubs should not be
expected to pay. Mr Whalley would keep Mr Smith in touch over
this particular issue.

6.   Mr Fox referred to a question which Lord Justice Taylor had
put to him, ie, should pitch invasion become a criminal offence.
It was the Football League's view that it should.  It was
Mr Hutt's view that Lord Justice Taylor was looking to see whether
there was scope for such an offence. Mr Fox referred to the
Arsenal-Everton game last year at which Lord Ferrers had been
present and where a pitch invasion had occurred.   That invasion



                                                /had been an.

                                   2
had been an example of high spirits but the problem was that
situations could easily turn. The Football League, had amongst
other things, to think of the safety of players.  Although Mr Fox
believed that trouble within grounds was not as bad as it once
was, they were still worried about this aspect.  Lord Ferrers saw
difficulties in making pitch invasions a criminal offence. The
practicalities of making it so would have to be considered.

7.   Turning to the matter of ticket touts, the final point which
he and his colleagues wished to discuss, Mr Fox said he was
concerned about how touts operated on the day of the game.   Taking
the FA Cup Final as an example Mr Fox explained that despite
precautions tickets still .found their way to the touts. The touts
blocked the market and sold tickets regardless of whether or not
the buyer would be sitting amongst supporters of his own team.
Mr Fox hoped that consideration would be given to making it an
offence to sell tickets on match days. The difficulty
Lord Ferrers saw with this concerned the innocent man attending a
match with a group but because one of them drops out through
illness, for example, he would be committing an offence by trying
to sell his: ticket. The other problem would be that touts would
simply sell their tickets further and further away from the
grounds, say at the train stations where supporters would arrive.
Mr Fox appreciated the difficulties and said that the way round it
might be to make it an offence to sell tickets above the face
value.

8.   In concluding the meeting Lord Ferrers said that he was
grateful to Mr Fox and his colleagues for having made him aware of
their concerns and should they find it useful in the future to
come and see him again.

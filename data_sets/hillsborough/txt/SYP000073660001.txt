            I am a single man and I have                  supported Liverpool F.C.      for the last

            eight years.             I support them at every /natch I can.              I am a season

            ticket holder.

            About four or five days before the F.A. Cup Semi-Final                       between

            Liverpool and Nottingham Forest I bought a £.6 Leppings Lane Terrace

            ticket for the match at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April,                          1989

            (150489).

            I travelled to tt>/joatch on a coach I had b p tfte d                itthrough       Barnes

            into the^ e lid e        terraces and one went in^o a stand.

            The coach left from Priory Road, Walton at about 11.30am (1130).Before

            leaving on the coach the local Liverpool                    police got on the

             the coach with no hold       ups.

             We got into Sheffield at about 1.30pm (1330) and parked amongst other

             coaches about five minutes walk away from the ground.

             The police were around       telling people where to park.      They   did not

             escort me or direct me       to the ground.

             On the walk to the ground I could see some fans drintj>fSg alcohol and

             soft drinks from cans but it was no more than aj^'any other match.

             I walked past the Leppings Lane entrance aj^about 1,35pm C1335).                   At

             that time there were a fair amount o f ^ n s         and police in the area

             but it was not a mob.       There was plenty of room to move about          in.        I

             went and bought a hamburger f rorgr the local shops and had a little walk

             about.

             I remember seeing a few police on fo/Tt around Leppings Lane.               I went

             back to the ground at about 2 :0^fn (1405).           I had a big plastic bottle

             of orange and a policewoman t/<fld me that I would not be allowed into

             the ground with the bottle.         I hung around for about ten minutes

S .O ff      drinking the orange.       During this tirjwr'i could see that there was a

             mass of people between the t u r n & t i l e   and the blue wrought    iron gates.

             I joined the mass of p e o p j / e just outside of the gates.      I could see

             some police in the PdqJiS% they were trying to get people to get back and

             form queues and J^Ke police outside in Leppings Lane were telling

             people to ge^/to the turnstiles and not 1 injj^fr in the street,

             A mou M i - *'potPfcHfiyn walked his horse tj^ough the centre of the crowd

             towards the turnstiles.             >pp«
                                            I stej      behind the horse and followed it

             down to get nearer the froi

             I got into the crowd rTSfar the front of the turnstiles.           It was hard

             trying to get through the turnstiles as people were pushing and

             jostling   I was a bit anxious to get into the ground because I was

             frightened of being pushed into the walls at the side of the
                                                                                            PAGE         3
                                                                                            SI 792

             turnstiles.

             I could see one policeman standing on something shouting at people to

             get back.        He appeared to be having a head loss.

             The other policeman I could see in front of the turnstiles was getting

             squashed against the wall,       so he managed to turn and go through the

             t u rn sti le.

             It took me about ten minutes from the time            I joined the people      in

             front of the turnstile until         I entered the ground through the

             turnstile.

             I had while I was waiting seen a number of fans              climb onto the

             turnstile    roof.     I think this was because of the crush and not just to

             bunk in.

             Two of my friends              and                     had followed me in.         It was

             nearly empty in the compound.          I went with             ind            and had

             a cup of tea.        I could see stewards by the stairs        leading to the West

             Stand.     I only saw one policeman he was ejecting a fan.

             I could hear fans coming in saying how bad the crush was outside and I

             could see other fans on the turnstile roof.            They all appeared to be

             waving match tickets.

             After my cup of tea I asked                and              if they would come

             behind the goal.       They said no as they/Gould rather go to the side,

             I have visited Hillsborough three              four times    in the past and

              v e rytime the centre pens get^Plilled I have seen police and stewards

             turning people away from             tunnel.     This time I did not see any

             police or stewards by           tunnel entrance so I thought that it was

             O.K.   to go down as I expected there would be enough room,

through the crowd into the middle of the pen and to the near the

front a p p r o k imately six feet from the perimeter fence,      I was behind a

crush barrier.       There was one person between it and me to start with.

The pen was packed but we could sway forwards and backwards.                 It was a

good atmosphere.       When the teams were announced over the tannoy,             the

pressure got worse instead of swaying back we were staying forward.

The man in front of me was pushing hard backwards against the barrier

and when he had made enough room he ducked underneath it                      s

pushed against tfie barrier but I was trying to keep it a<                   m me

by using straight arms and all my strength.

I could ses all other people in the pen were having trouble,                people

were shouting push back,       push back.    This must have been about 2.55pm

(•1455).   I knew that I had to get away from the barrier or be severely

injured.     I knew that anyone against a barrier would get hurt.

I remember thinking that people coul dn ’t get back as there was a brick

wall and the only way out was by the tunnel.

It was about this time I could see fans in front of me trying to climb

the perimeter fence.

I was near the end of the right hand side of the barrier.              The

pressure was so great      I tried to move to^fcfie end and get round the

barrier.     I was   in pain at this t i m ^ r i g h t across my abdomen.     The

other people on the barrier w e r ^ a s k i n g   the people in front to push

them back.     These people in f'ront could not do this as all they

could move was their heads.

As I was squeezed around the barriers end I was in severe pain all

about my abdomen.       My trousers had ripped all down the one seam.               I

was   in front of the barrier but I was in a worse position I was

leaning slightly forward but because of the crush I could only move

my head.     My hands feet and legs and body were that compressed in the

crush I could not move them.         I was very frightened.

          I could     see people scaling the p a n m e t e r fence,   I could see police

          looking     into the pen through Juhe fence.      Everyone was shouting for

          help.     They seemed unaware 'of the crisis.

          I could     see the neck and head of a small 19 or 20 year old Asian or

          Pakistani     in front of me he was panicky,      he was asking me to help

          him.     I told him    I couldn't as I could not move myself I told him           to

          tilt his head back and take deep breaths.

          I was doing this myself as I was blacking out, my head felt funny

          light headed my body was aching with something              like pins and needles

          all over,     I was very hot and sweaty.       I was desperate     I was trying not

          to panic and to breathe I thought that if I blacked out,              I would die.

          I managed to get       my breath and I felt slightly better. After a couple

          of minutes     I saw   people on top of the perimeter fence trying to

          pull    people out of the crowd.

          I heard people shouting         behind me for people to open the perimeter

          fence gate.

          A short time later there was a shout behind me "There is a fellow dead

          here".     I could only slightly turn my head        I thought it was coming

          from just to the left        of the barrier I had been hurt on.

          I looked over my left hand side and saw a lifeless figure being passed

          over the heads of the people on my left.           He was a big feller      I think
DeTTTtC
          he was in his thirties or forties,         but his face was all      puffed out and

          a purple/blue colour.        I can not remember what he was wearing.

          He got to the front and people tried to lift him over the perimeter

          fence,     but he was all    floppy and he fell a few times onto the        heads

          of the trapped crowd.On one of the attempts to get               him over   the

          fence I could see that a wound in the mans stomach surrounded by

          bruising.      I thought that    it had happened when he was being lifted

          onto the perimeter fence.        I thought one of the spikes on the fence

          had caused it.

I was still stuck people were clambering over us and climbing out of

the pen.     I d o n ’t think the police realised how bad it was              in the

pens.    I waited for what seemed a very long time then the crush

gradually started to ease.            This then got slightly easier and there

was a bit of room.         I remember two men to my left being on their

knees.     They were    in a panic to get up.          There was just a little bit

of room to push back I told the others to push back and they did.                          I

and others helped pull the men to their feet.

It got gradually easier and easier to move about.                     I could see a white

man in his late thirties          lying on his back on the terrace.            I think

he was wearing a jumper.           He had a very thick bushy moustache.               He

did not appear to be breathing.              I k-rtelt down beside him and ^t^r'Ced

to give him mouth to mouth res^etlcitation.               After about 5 attempts

he gave a cough and his ^ e s          fluttered and he started to come roun d.

I helped him to his              with another man and he was very

unsteady.      I walked him down to the railing of the perimeter fence.

He was improving but still wobbly.

I heard some one shouting          I turned around and saw a man waving me over

to the side segregation fence of pen 4 and 5.

I went over to him and he told me to get myself out.                     I tried to climb

over the railings but I was still to weak.                 He cupped his hands

through the raliinq/and gave me a boost up.  I was that weak I j(

                  and a hole was rolled open.

                  Police and fans then entered Pen 4 by this                hole. I saw the dead man

                  who I had first seen being passed over the                heads of the people on my

                  left.    He was lying in the pen on the floor by the front wall.                   There

                  were two policemen with him.

                  I walked away towards the touchline by tta                 >uthStand.     I remember

                  seeing people running up and                carrying injured on the hoarding

                  boards.          c/rr                    HOA££>.

                  I walked towards wtfere they were running that is towards the area

                  between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.               I was going to see if I

                  could help and also to see if I could find                                I remember

                  seeing a lot of the injured had blue faces.               I remember seeing one man

                  lying down,     there                                                    mouth to him.

                                      him                                                 was none.         Hi s

                  He took over heart massage from me and it was either a policeman or an

                  This man asked the Doctor if the man was alive after a                  while.    The

        ^         Doctor shook his head        and stopped the heart massage and the policeman

                  stopped the mouth to mouth.

I started to cry then and the man who had asked fell to his knees and

beat the grass with his fist and screaming            "No, No".

I was walking around crying.          Everywhere   I looked I could see people

giving first aid to people.

I remember seeing one woman giving heart massage to a boy in his early

teens and a fan was giving him mouth to mouth.             I told the woman to do

the heart massage harder, as soon as I said that a policeman who was

kneeling beside her took his hat off and said,             " I ’ll do that luv".

He took over and I could see the boy had started to vomit, and the fan

who was giving mouth to mouth turned his head on one side.

I went and got an ambulance man who was helping someone with a broken

arm.     He left the man with the broken arm and went to the aid of this

lad and he got something out of his bag and put it down the lads

throat.     That is when I walked away.

I was walking back towards the terrace when I saw                        and his

friend on the pitch.         They asked me where            and           was I

took t h e m A o   the c orne r J v s t race where I knew they were standing.     I

heard ffrenny Dalglisjyon the tannoy at this time asking for people to

remain calm and assist where they could.

We saw              and          after a little time.      They made their way to

us and a policeman opened the perimeter fence gate and let us join

them.     I only joined them,                 went to the stand to find his

other son.

We stood on the terrace for about 10 minutes then we left of our own

accord to go back to the coach.

I could only limp to the coach as I had pains in my groin and              the    top

of my right leg and my chest was aching with            sharp pains.   On the     way

to the coach I stopped and phoned home.

When we got to the coach we got on and drove             home.    I got home about

7:30pm.

pitch or any part of the match.

In my opinion if the tunnel       entrance had          covered by stewards or

po 1 i ce to stop and direct fans t M l f h e r   parts of the ground,   this

tragedy would never have haj^rened.

The fans would have b e e n ^ b l e   to spread out if the side pen

segregation fences had been removed.

When the crush first started I saw police looking into the pen they

seemed unaware of the crisis.         People were shouting for ages before

anyone outside the pens treated the requests for assistance with any

s er i o u s nes s.

I never saw any person before or after the trouble drunk or any

disorderly behaviour although I did see a few drinking            from cans, and

they were fewer than I have seen at other gar

   Good and sufficient cause. Protection of the public against the infliction of violence is capable of
inclusion within the phrase “good and sufficient cause". However an application for an extension of
the custody time limit will be refused, notwithstanding danger to the public, where the prosecution
has not actcd with all due expedition since the conditions of sub-s (3) above are cumulative, and must
both be satisfied (R i-Luton Crown Court, e x p Neaves (1992] Crim LR 721).
   Neither the seriousness of the offence charged nor the short duration of the extension proposed
constitute "good and sufficient cause" for the purposes of sub-s (3) above (J? v Governor o f Winchester
Prison, r.v p Roddic [1991] 2 All ER 931, [1991] 1 WLR 303).
   The fact that no judge or court room is available for a trial, and there is no clear indication of when
the case is likely to be tried, does not constitute a “good and sufficient cause" tor extending a custody
time limit under this section (R v Norwich Crown Court, e x p Stiller (1992) 156 JP 624).
   All due expedition. This expression connotes all the expedition that is due in the circumstances
(R v Croii’n Court at Xorwich, r.v p Parker and W ard (1992] Crim LR 500, (1993) 96 Cr App R 68).
See also the first paragraph of the note “Good and sufficient cause” above.
   The fact of police understaffing is merely a reason for delay, and does not satisfy the requirement
that the prosecution act with all due expedition. That condition has to be measured objectively,
otherwise it would be easy to fulfil the test whenever staff shortages existed and this would defeat the
purpose of custody time limits legislation w'hich is to reduce the time spent by defendants in prison
 (R i>G oi’ernor o f Winchester Prison, ex p Roddie [1991] 2 All ER 931, (1991] 1 WLR 303).

INTRODUCTION

1.1   T he decision to prosecute an individual is a serious
      step. Fair and effective prosecution is essential to the
      m aintenance of law and order. But even in a small case,
      a prosecution has serious implications for all involved -
      th e victim, a w itn e s s and a defendant. T h e C rown
      P r o s e c u t io n S e r v ic e a pplies th e Code for C row n
      P ro s e c u to rs so th at it can make fair and c o n sisten t
      decisions about prosecutions.

1.2   T h e Code contains information that is im portant to
      police officers, to o th e rs who work in th e criminal
      justice system and to the general public. It helps the
      Crown Prosecution Service to play its part in making
      sure that justice is done.


GENERAL PRINCIPLES

2.1   Each case is unique and must be considered on its own,
      but there are general principles that apply in all cases.

2.2   The duty of the Crown Prosecution Service is to make
      sure that the right person is prosecuted for the right
      offence and th at all rele v a n t facts are given to th e
      court.

2.3   Crown P ro s e c u to rs m u st be fair, in d e p e n d e n t and
      objective. They must not let their personal views of
      th e ethnic or national origin, sex, religious beliefs,
      political views or sexual preference of th e offender,
      victim or witness influence their decisions. T hey m ust
      also not be affected by improper or undue p re s s u re
      from any source.
         REVIEW


         3.1     P r o c e e d i n g s a r e u s u a ll y s t a r t e d by t h e p o lic e .
                 Sometimes they may consult the Crown Prosecution
                Service before charging a defendant. Each case that
                the police send to the Crown Prosecution Service is
                reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor to make sure that it
                m e e t s t h e t e s t s s e t o u t in t h i s C o d e . C r o w n
                Prosecutors may decide to continue with the original
                charges, to change the charges or sometimes to stop
                the proceedings.


        3.2     Review, how ever, is a co n tin u in g p r o c e s s so th a t
                Crown Prosecutors can take into account any change in
               circum stances. W herever possible, th e y talk to the
               police first if they are thinking about changing th e
               charges or stopping the proceedings. This gives the
               police th e chance to provide more information that
               m ay affect t h e decision. T h e C rown P r o s e c u t io n
               S er\ ice and the police work closely together to reach
               the right decision, but the final responsibility for the
               decision rests with the Crown Prosecution Service.


    4   THECODETESTS

        4.1    T here are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The
               first stage is t h e e v id e n tia l te s t. If the case does not
               pass the evidential test, it m ust not go ahead, no m atter
               how important or serious it may be. If the case does
               p a s s th e evidential te s t, Crown P ro s e c u to rs m u s t
               decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest.




4
     4.2    This second stage is t h e public i n t e r e s t t e s t . T he
            Crown Prosecution Service will only start or continue
            a prosecution w hen the case has passed both te s ts .
            T he evidential test is explained in section 5 and th e
            public interest test is explained in section 6.

^   THE EVIDENTIAL TES T

    5.1    Crown P r o s e c u to rs m u st be satisfied th a t th e r e is
           enough evidence to provide a ‘realistic p ro sp e c t of
           conviction against each defendant on each charge.
           They m ust consider what the defence case mav be and
           how' that is likely to affect the prosecution case.

    5.2    A realistic prospect of conviction is an objective test. It
           m eans that a jury or bench of m agistrates, properly
           directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than
           not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.

    5.3    When deciding w hether there is enough evidence to
           prosecute. Crown Prosecutors must consider w hether
           the evidence can be used and is reliable. There will be
           many cases in which the evidence does not give any
           cause foi concern. But there will also be cases in which
           the evidence may not be as strong as it first appears.
           Crown Prosecutors m ust ask themselves the following
           questions:




                                                                               5
C an t h e e v id e n c e b e u s e d in c o u rt?

a    Is it likely that the evidence will be excluded by the
     court? T h e re are certain legal rules which might
     mean that evidence which seem s relevant cannot
     be given at a trial. For example, is it likely that the
     evidence will be excluded because of th e way in
     w hich it w a s g a th e r e d o r b e c a u s e of th e r u le
     against using hearsay as evidence? If so, is there
     enough o th e r evidence for a realistic prospect of
     conviction?

Is t h e e v id e n c e reliab le ?

b    Is it likely that a confession is unreliable, for example,
     because of the defendant’s age. intelligence or lack of
     understanding?

c    Is the w itness’s background likely to weaken the
     prosecution case? For example, does the witness
     have any dubious motive that may affect his or her
     a t t i t u d e to t h e c a s e or a r e l e v a n t p r e v i o u s
     conviction?

d    It th e id e n tity of th e d e fe n d a n t is likely to be
     q u e s tio n e d , is th e e v id e n c e a b out th is s tr o n g
     enough?

C ro w n P r o s e c u t o r s s h o u ld n o t ig n o r e e v id e n c e
b e c au se th ey are not sure that it can be u sed or is
reliab le . B u t th e y sh o u ld look c losely a t it w h e n
deciding if there is a realistic prospect of conviction.
THE PUBLIC INTEREST TEST

6.1   In 1951, Lord Shawcross, who was Attorney General,
      made the classic statem ent on public interest, which
      has been supported by Attorneys General ever since:
      “It has never been the rule in this country - 1 hope it
      never will be - that suspected criminal offences m ust
      automatically be the subject of prosecution”. (House of
      C o m m o n s D e b a t e s , v o lu m e 483, co lu m n 681, 29
      January 1951.)

6.2   The public interest m ust be considered in each case
      where there is enough evidence to provide a realistic
      prospect of conviction. In cases of any seriousness, a

      Although there may be public interest factors against
      prosecution in a particular case, often the prosecution
      should go ahead and those factors should be put to the
      court for consideration when sentence is being passed.

6.3   C row n P r o s e c u t o r s m u s t b alance fa c to rs for and
      against prosecution carefully and fairly. Public interest
      factors that can affect the decision to prosecute usually
      d e p e n d on t h e s e r i o u s n e s s of th e offence o r th e
      c ir c u m s ta n c e s of th e offender. Som e fac to rs may
      increase the need to prosecute but others may suggest
      that another course of action would be better.
    The follow ing lists of som e common public
    interest factors, both for and against prosecution,
    are not exhaustive. The factors that apply will
    depend on the facts in each case.

    Some common public interest factors in favour
    of prosecution

The more serious the offence, the more likely it is that
a prosecution will be needed in the public interest. A
prosecution is likely to be needed if:

a      a conviction is likely to r e s u l t in a significant
       sentence;

b      a weapon was used or violence was th re a te n e d
       during the commission of the offence;

c     t h e o ffe n c e w as c o m m i tt e d a g a in s t a p e r s o n
      serving the public (for example, a police or prison
      officer, or a nurse);

d     th e defendant w as in a position of a u thority or
      trust;


e     th e e v id e n c e sh o w s th a t th e d e fe n d a n t w as a
      ringleader or an organiser of the offence;

f     t h e r e is e v i d e n c e   that    th e   o f fe n c e   was
      premeditated;

g     there is evidence that the offence was carried out
      by a group;
h   the victim of the offence was vulnerable, has been
    put in considerable fear, or suffered personal attack,
    damage or disturbance;

i   t h e o f fe n c e w a s m o t i v a t e d by a n y f o r m of
    d i s c r im i n a t i o n a g a in s t t h e v i c t i m ’s e t h n i c or
    national origin, sex, religious beliefs, political views
    or sexual preference;

j   there is a marked difference betw een the actual or
    mental ages of the defendant and the victim, or if
    there is any element of corruption;

k   the defendant’s previous convictions or cautions
    are relevant to the present offence;

I   th e defendant is alleged to have co m m itte d the
    offence whilst under an order of the court;

m there are grounds for believing that the offence is
  likely to be continued or repeated, for example, by a
  history of recurring conduct: or

n   t h e offence, a lth o u g h n o t s e r i o u s in itse lf, is
    widespread in the area where it was committed.
    Some common public interest factors against
    prosecution

    A prosecution is less likely to be needed if:

    a    the c ourt is likely to im pose a v e ry small or
         nominal penalty;

    b t h e offence w as c o m m itte d as a r e s u l t of a
      genuine m istake or m is u n d e rs ta n d in g (these
      factors m ust be balanced against the seriousness
      of the offence);

    c   the loss or harm can be described as minor and
        was the result of a single incident, particularly if
        it was caused by a misjudgment;

    d   there has been a long delay betw een the offence
        taking place and the date of the trial, unless:

         • the offence is serious;
         • th e delay has b e e n ca u se d in p a rt by th e
           defendant;
        • the offence has only recently come to light; or
        • the complexity of the offence has m eant that
          there has been a long investigation;

e       a prosecution is likely to have a very bad effect
        on the victim’s physical or mental health, always
        bearing in mind the seriousness of the offence;

f       the defendant is elderly or is, or was at the time
        of the offence, suffering from significant mental
        nr physical ill h e a lth , u n le s s th e offence is
          serious or there is a real possibility that it may be
          repeated. The Crown Prosecution Service, where
          necessary, applies Home Office guidelines about
          how to deal with mentally disordered offenders.
          Crown Prosecutors m ust balance the desirability of
          d i v e r t i n g a d e f e n d a n t w ho is s u f f e r i n g fro m
          significant mental or physical ill health with the
          need to safeguard the general public;

      g   the defendant has put right the loss or harm that
          w a s c a u s e d (but d e f e n d a n t s m u s t n o t av o id
          p r o s e c u t i o n s im p ly b e c a u s e t h e y can p a y
          compensation); or

      h    details may be made public that could harm sources
           of information, international relations or national
           security.

6.6   Deciding on the public interest is not simply a m atter
      of adding up the number of factors on each side. Crown
      Prosecutors m ust decide how important each factor is
      in the circumstances of each case and go on to make an
      overall assessment.

             Yout h o f f e n d e r s


  6.8        Crown P rosecutors m ust consider the in te rests of a
             youth when deciding w hether it is in the public interest
             to prosecute. The stigma of a conviction can cause very
            se nous harm to the prospects of a youth offender or a
            young adult. Young offenders can sometim es be dealt
            with without going to court. But Crown P rosecutors
            should not avoid prosecuting simply because of the
            defendant's age. The seriousness of the offence or the
            o f f e n d e r ’s p a s t b e h a v io u r m ay m ake p r o s e c u tio n
            necessary.

            Police c a u tio n s


 6.9        The police make the decision to caution an offender in
          accordance with Home Office guidelines. If the defendant
         admits the oflence, cautioning is the m o st common
         a te in a d \e to a court appearance. Crown Prosecutors,
         where necessary, apply the same guidelines and should
         look at the alternatives to prosecution when thev consider
        the public interest. Crown Prosecutors should tell the
        police if they think that a caution would be more suitable
        than a prosecution.


CHARGES


7.1     Crown Prosecutors should select charges which:

        a     reflect the seriousness of the offending:

        b     give the court adequate sentencing powers; and
      c    enable th e case to be p r e s e n t e d in a c le a r and
           simple way.

      This m eans that Crown Prosecutors may not always
      continue with the most serious charge where there is a
      c h o ic e . F u r t h e r , C ro w n P r o s e c u t o r s s h o u ld n o t
      continue with more charges than are necessary.

7.2   Crown Prosecutors should never go ahead with more
      c h a r g e s th a n a re n e c e s s a r y j u s t to e n c o u r a g e a
      defendant to plead guilty to a few. In the same way, they
      should never go ahead with a more serious charge just
      to e n c o u ra g e a d e fe n d a n t to plead guilty to a less
      serious one.

7.3   Crown P r o s e c u t o r s should not change th e c harge
      simply because of the decision made by the court or the
      defendant about where the case will be heard.

M O D E OF T R I A L


8.1   The Crown Prosecution Service applies the c urrent
      guidelines for magistrates who have to decide w hether
      cases should be tried in the Crown Court w hen the
      offence gives the option. (See the ‘National Mode of
      Trial G uidelines’ issued by the Lord Chief Justice.)
      Crown Prosecutors should recommend Crown Court
      trial when they are satisfied that the guidelines require
      them to do so.




                                                                                     13
5.2    Speed m ust never be the only reason for asking for a
       case to stay in th e m a g is tra te s ’ courts. But Crown
       P ro sec u to rs should consider the effect of any likely
       delay if they send a case to the Crown Court, and any
       possible stress on victims and w itnesses if the case is
       delayed.


ACCEPTI NG GUILTY PLEAS

9.1    Defendants may want to plead guilty to some, but not
       all, of the charges. Or they may want to plead guilty to a
       different, possibly less serious, charge because they
       a r e a d m i t t i n g o n ly p a r t of t h e c r i m e . C ro w n
       Prosecutors should only accept the defendant’s plea if
       they think the court is able to pass a sen te n c e that
       m a tc h e s th e s e r i o u s n e s s of th e offending. C row n
       P r o s e c u t o r s m u s t n e v e r a c ce p t a guilty plea j u s t
       because it is convenient.


RE-STARTING A PROSECUTI ON

1G. 1 People should be able to rely on decisions taken by the
      Crown Prosecution Service. Normally, if the Crown
      Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant that
      there will not be a prosecution, or that the prosecution
      has been stopped, that is the end of the m atter and the
      c a se will not s ta r t again. B ut oc c asio n a lly t h e r e
      a re sp ecial r e a s o n s w hy th e C row n P r o s e c u t io n
      Service will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the
      case is serious.
"‘   0.2 These reasons include:

            a    rare cases where a new look at the original decision
                 shows that it was clearly wrong and should not be
                 allowed to stand;

           b    cases which are stopped so that m ore evidence
                which is likely to become available in the fairly near
                future can be collected and prep a re d . In t h e s e
                cases, the Crown Prosecutor will tell the defendant
                that the prosecution may well start again;

           c    c a s e s w hich a re s to p p e d b e c a u s e of a lack of
                evidence but w here more significant evidence is
                discovered later.

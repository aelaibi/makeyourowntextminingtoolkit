<349

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN    ihE DEATHS OR       fHE INJURIES   IQ ANY PERSON?

THE CENTRAL STANDING AREA WAS TOO FULL WITH NOT ENOUGH ESCAPE ROUTES, THE
                                  O f T
SLOWNESS OF THE EMERGENCY SERVICE REACTIONS AND THE MISINTERPRETATION BY THE

POLICE OF THE SITUATION.             THEY REACTED AS IF IT WERE A DISORDER SITUATION
                                                                                   PAGE

 RATHER THAN A DISASTER.

 Q5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4 . 10PM (1610).

  s-1

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,

 A STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF OUR OWN ACCORD.


Q18



        YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 <i53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,     AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE EMERGENCY SERVICES D I D N ’T SEEM TO HAVE ANY PLAN,   THE POLICE WERE DEPLOYED

 IN LARGE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 HELPING WITH THE INJURED AND FREEING PEOPLE.       I FEEL THAT MORE FIRE ENGINES

 WITH THE EXPERTISE OF FIREMEN IN FREEING TRAPPED PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE FREED MORE

        MORE QUICKLY.   THE TANNOY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO

 COMMUNICATE THE PROBLEM TO THE REMAINDER OF THE CROWD. THIS WOULD HAVE STOPPED

 ANY TAUNTS FROM THE NOTTINGHAM SUPPORTERS,     THEREBY RELEASING MORE POLICE TO

 ASSIST AT LEPPINGS LANE.


Q 19

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU’ WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?           d,^p=f                      C   O   M    'M

 ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT THE POLICE SEEMED TOTALLY DISORGANISES*. NO OFFICER

 SEEMED TO SHOW ANY LEADERSHIP LEAVING OFFICERS TO ACT ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE
                                                                                 PAGE    9

 THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE TOTALLY HIS-INFORMED ABOUT THE SITUATION WITH LITTLE

 IF ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN T H E M . IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT SOMETHING HAD

 GONE DISASTROUSLY WRONG,         ESPECIALLY WHEN CORPSES WERE BEING BROUGHT OUT.

 I C A N ’T UNDERSTAND WHY THE POLICE D I D N ’T REACT QUICKER.   THERE WERE A LOT OF

 PEOPLE WANDERING ABOUT IN S H O C K , SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED TO HELP

 THEM BUT THERE W A S N ’T.

 THE INITIAL USE OF POLICE OFFICERS           A\CORDON     (FILTER)    IN FRONT OF NORTH

 STAND WAS INAPPROPRIATE.     SUPPORTERS FROM THE STAND WERE SHOUTING FOR THEM

 TO GO AND ASSIST THfi^INJURED AT l EPPINGS LANE STAND.              IT TOOK THEM A MINUTE

 OR SO BEFORE THEY APPRECIATED THE NEED,

 MANY OF THE OFFICERS WERE DOxNG LESS THAN SUPPORTERS IN ASSISTING AND IN FACT

 HINDERED THE SPEEDYHSfMGVAL OF     INJURED BY REMAINING        IN    A CORDON ACROSS THE

 FIELD AT THE HALF WAY LINE.

 T^jp^E WERE OFFICERS USING THEIR       INTSE^ATIVE AND GETTING STUCK       IN.

 IN THE GYM THERE WERE ABOUT 30 OFFICERSHjHO WERE JUST STANDING ABOUT DOING

 NOTHING.                                           Ik

LAST YEAR SEEMED A LOT BETTER.         THERE WERE MORESgOyICEMEN ABOUT BY THE GROUND ,

 I HAD MY TICKET CHECKED ABOUT THREE TIMES BEFORE I GOT TO THE GROUND,         AND

THERE WERE POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES MAKING PEOPLE QUEUE TO GET IN.           ALSO AS I

 GOT NEAR TO THE GATES LAST YEAR,       IT WAS A CASE THAT THE POLICE TOLD YOU TO

 GET IN TO THE GROUND, YOU C O U L D N ’T HANG AROUND OUTSIDE.

Q1i



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I SAW PEOPLE SPILLING FROM THE TERRACES AT LEPFINGS LANE END ON TO THE

 TRACK BEHIND THE G O A L .   I THOUGHT IT WAS AN OVERCROWDING PROBLEM.      AS MORE

 PEOPLE CAME OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE,       THE POLICE ALSO CAME ON TO THE TRACK,

 LINED UP IN FRONT OF OUR STAND AND ALSO ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE PITCH BY

 THE HALFWAY LINE.  MORE PEOPLE KEPT COMING ON TO THE PITCH, SOME WERE
                                                 /
 DAZED AND STAGGERING ABOUT OTHERS WERE C O L O R S ING ON THE PITCH. THERE WERE

 q0ER     GROUPS OF POLICEMEN MILLING ABOUT   J& 17H   THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF THE

 GOAL.      SOME OF THEM WERE ASSISTING Tbffc INJURED BUT SOME OF THEM APPEARED

 TO BE DOING NOTHING AT ALL.      AS THE/INCIDENT CONTINUED TO UNFOLD I COULD

 NOT UNDERSTAND WHY     THE POLICE OFF/CERS LINING ACROSS THE PITCH WERE NOT

 DEPLOYED TO ASSIST WITH FIRST A / D .

 HAD TO LITERALLY SHOUT TO ONE ANOTHER TO MAKE OURSELVES HEARD.                AS THE

 INCIDENT UNFOLDED,       SOME ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE BUT WE COULD NOT HEAR

 THEM CLEARLY IN OUR STAND.

 LIVERPOOL HAVE MORE FANS ATTENDING THE I R p G U A L A R     MATCHES THAN FOREST IN SPITE

 OF THIS LIVERPOOLS TICKET ALLOCATION WAfe L E S S THAN FOREST, DUE TO THE

 POLICE RECOMMENDING THAT LIVERPOOL USE THE LEPPIMGS LANE AND NORTH STAND,

 THIS WAS DUE TO THE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL OF THE/TANS.

 IT IS A WELL KNOWN FACT THAT SUPPORTERS W I L y T R A V E L TO IMPORTANT MATCHES

 EVEN THOUGH WITHOUT TICKETS,         KNOWING THAT/TICKETS WILL BE ON SALE FROM

 TOUTS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.          THE SITUATIOl/SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICED

      pDRDINGLY.

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED. AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A DISTINCT LACK OF FIRST AID FACILITIES TO ASSIST

 INJURED/DYING PEOPLE. THE POLICE ON THE PITCH DID AS MUCH AS

 THEY COULD.

 Q54

 I ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH    TO^jADD WHICH YOU FEEL   IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE INCIDENT HAS HAPPENED DUE TO LACK OF ORQVjxl ISAT ION OUTSIDE THE

 G R O U N D , THERE NOT BEING ENOUGH POLICE OFFICERS TSJ ORGANISE THE CROWD OUTSIDE.

 ONCE   INSIDE MORE STEWARDS/POLICE OFFICERS TO DIRECT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE

 CENTRE TUNNEL.       THE WRONG ENDS OF THE CROWD WERE ALLOCATED TO THE WRONG

 CLUBS - LIVERPOOL HAVING THE LARGER SUPPORT.

 I FEEL ITS WRONG THAT DRINK HAD         BEEN BLAMED FOR THE INCIDENT.   A LARGE

 CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED         NEAR TO KICK OFF TIME.

 G45
 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?

Q17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU     CONSIDER   WAS A FACTOR IN THE. DEATHS,   OR

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

        CONSTRUCTION OF THE FRONT FENCING OF THE PENS WHICH WAS TOO HIGH, MORE

 LIKE CONCENTRATION CAMP FENCING.      I FELT THERE WERE TOO MANY CRASH

 BARRIERS    IN THE CONFINED AREAS OF THE PENS.

Q 13

 Q3H
 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 INITIALLY I SAW PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES INTO THE SEATS

 ABOVE,    OBVIOUSLY TO GET A GOOD SEAT.    AFTER THAT THEY WERE BEING PULLED

 TO SAFETY, BUT I THOUGHT THE FIRST ONES WERE IN THE WRONG.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS AN OBVIOUS LACK OF     INVOLVEMENT BY THE B<5LICE, BECAUSE OF AN OBVIOUS

 ^p:K OF UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE SERIOUSNESSJ/uF 'THE INCIDENT.       I FEEL THAT

 THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE REALISED S O O N E R ,/ fHE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION

 AND REACTED QUICKER,    I.E. HELPING PE0p/e OUT AND OPENING THE FRONT GATES

 OF THE PENS.                                  C A T     *&>'/&£££_       C
 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FJ*€l      IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.    I FEEL THERE WAS AN UNNECESSARY DELAY IN /JETTING PEOPLE TO THE GROUND

 BECAUSE THE POLICE WERE STOPPING VEHICLES FOR NO APPARENT REASON.

 2.    THE MATCH LAST YEAR WAS HELD ON THE SAME DAY AS THE GRAND NATIONAL AND

 I ^ E E L THIS KEPT A LOT OF TICKETLESS PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE GROUND.         FOR THIS

 REASON THE MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD ON THE SAME DAY AGAIN.

 3.    THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CHECKED BEFORE THE MATCH FOR TICKETS.           THIS

 WOULD HAVE KEPT THE FANS AWAY FROM THE GROUND WHO D I D N ”T/fHAVE TICKETS.

 4.    THERE WAS A LACK OF POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND R E N T I N G   IN A LACK

 OF CONTROL AT THE TURNSTILES.

 5.    I WOULD LIKE TO SAY HOW GOOD THE SHEFFIELD PEOPLE WERE IN RESPONSE TO

 THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS FOLLOWING THE TRAGEDY I.E. LETTING US USE THEIR

 PHONES.

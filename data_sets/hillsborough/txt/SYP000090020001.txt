                  but no one        checked          ticket    before       reaching   the turnstiles.

                  we all    spread out and joined the mas?of                    people.     I was    nearest       to

                                    and                        but as       I made my way forward         I got split

                  up and was        on my own.        I got    pushed ar ou nd a lot and was            crushed.             I

                  wou d say    it was       the worst    crush       1 have ever been in.           I e ve nt ua ll y

                  reached the \ u r n s t i le but did not s#e any P o li ce me n there.                    nI went

                  through a t urnstile area gave up my ticket.                         I did not see any other

                  gate    open other        than the turnstile.



                  Once    inside the        turnstile     it was      not so crowded but        I d vd not see any

                  of my friends at all.               I saw some stewards at the foot                of the stairs

                  w here you go up to the stand and a few policemen                         inside     the t u r n s t i 1 e

                  before you        reached       the stand.

           No one gave me any d irections                  but on going          through the turnsti les           I

           saw a tunnel       straight a hea d of me.               I did not see any arrows                pointing

           any other       cuNrections so         I headed to the tunnel              j\went        down the tunnel

           with ou t any     prdiUem and was             not   pushed.      On    reaching      the end of the

           tunnel       I realised       1 had not bought a programme and came                        back up the

           tunna 1 a^s^in.         As    I came along the         tunnel     I was      pushed about        by peopli

           going    down to the terrace.                 I bought my programme               from a seller who

           was    standing    on the          right as    I came out of the tunnel.                   I still    did

           not see any of my mates and                   it was   now about        twenty five         to twenty to

           three    <1435 - 1440).



           For    some    reason    I am not sure what            I did not go down the                tunnel    again.

           I saw some       people walking          around the end of the stand,                    and on seeing

           this    I decided to walk             to my    right and a ro u nd the end of the stand
 pej') 5
 S-?-      into    the terrace          near   to the north stand.               The terrace         in this area

           was    not    crowded and you          could stand w h e r e you^ w a n t e d .           I stood    in pen

  (?)      six for a while and then                1 saw some       lads.        1“ kne'Q^

                                                               a nd their    dad who wsre            standing    in pen

           7 so    I joined them,                was     not busy    in this area?            the    players were

           out    but    the game       had not kicked off.          Some        of the      lads a ro u nd us

           shouted to others             to    come and join us as there was                  plenty of room,



           I could s^B^that             the area at the         rear of the goal at the Leppinqs                   Lana

           end was very p a ^ e d .



           The    game kicked off and after a few minutes                         1 saw      people    coming    onto

           the    pitch from the          rear of the L ep pi ng s LN home goal area.                      1 thought

           at first       it was a split area w hich              I had seen b e f o r e ,           !he game was

           still    going on and          I saw a lad run up to the Liverpool                       goal   keeper and
                                                                                                       PAGE         4
                                                                                                       S3428

shout    to him.     After       this more and more            people    came onto        the     pitch and

the game was       stained.



I then saw pep pie         ly i ng on the        pitch    covered up,      they a p p e a r e d dead al

first    I thought    it was       only one or two but            it got worse.             Several

people were       trying     to get out of the            pen.    1 was in to help but

they,    the Police,       w ou ld not     let them out at first            but then they did

five    to ten minutes after             it all    started.       I did not go onto               the    pitch

or have any dealings wit h any dead or                     injured people.



                                                                                 (-Jtu w #SV*      1         * "*

called                    who    lives    in                                        I made my way

back    to where    our    cars were       parked and e ventually everyone arri ve d

back    except                                 We were    concerned because we knew Lee had

gone    into the terrace,          we had the          radio   on in the    car and the dead

and    injured    numbers       kept    going    up.                            rang his         home and

we a r r a n g e d for his      parents    to contact all         the families



We waited for       some     time and then me and                                   went        back to the

ground to try and find                         We went ar o u n d the ground and spoke                   to

a policeman at the t e mp or ar y mortuary.                    We gave    him               details and

he    checked for    us.        He told us he was          not there as far as              he    could

tell,    we went    back     to our   car and after waiting a gain for some time
                                          !
we decided to       check       the hospitals.  A policeman a d vi se d us to go to a

boys    club w hi c h was       being    used as an       incident      room.



We gave            name at       the boys       club and wa it ed for a while               unti1 a

helper was       given to us,          he was a Social         Worker    together wit h the

helper we went       to a nearby Police S t at i on and gave more                       details         of

but    they still    c o u l d n ’t give       us any further      information on
                                                                                                     PAGE     5

             At about        ten thirty we went         to the Social    Workers    home and    phoned our

             homes.         It was     then that                      found out thal           was alright

             but    in Hospital



           N^ereturned            to the Police Stat io n and by then they had found out where

                    wa*     ana   we   then visited him       in the Roy^l Ha ll am sh ir e Hospital     at

             Sheffield                                                             we   came home   to

             Liverpool        arriv i ng at about       12.30   (0030)



             I was    not     injured     in the     incident at the football       ground.



             I think        the Police     could have helped the         injured quicker      they did not

             seem to        realise at first what was going on,            and the re was      not as many

             as    I w ould have        expected to help there was more         s upporters     helping.

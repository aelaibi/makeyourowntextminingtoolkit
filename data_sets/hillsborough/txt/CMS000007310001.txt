       I am writing simply to thank you for the remarks you made
       yesterday in support of my announcement on all-seater stadia. I
       value the contribution of the All Party Football Committee to
       t h i s debate and would hope to secure cross-party support for the
       changes I am proposing in this sensitive area. As I said, I
       intend to announce my final conclusions as soon as possible after
       the four weeks' consultation.

              people.I         am very thankful             to   have     Mt       out    of this        tragedy with minor

              injuries »La s t year             w hen    I attejroed the            m a tc h    I had a sea t i n the N o r t h

              jBtand, but         the    fans were        sj/f 1 1 split w it h L iv erppol                 f a n s in the

              Leppings         Lane Stand.          T    can not       recall       any diffe re nc e           between this

              match and          last years         m a t ch w ith     regard to the Organi sat ion,                       but    1 think

              there were a lot more                  people at this             recent         g a m e because        last year         I

              got a s tand ticket               ea si ly and this year                I was       lucky to get £6 a standin

              t i c k e t for     the tere races.

              club     gates.          I think      Liverpool should               have    been      given      the    bigger      SPION

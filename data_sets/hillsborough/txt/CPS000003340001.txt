         Dear Mr Newell

         Further to your telephone conversation with my Chief Constable, Geoffrey
         Dear, of today I wish to confirm that we will attend your office at 1030
         hours on Friday 11 August 1989 to discuss issues raised on the telephone.

         I enclose herewith the letter that we have received from HM Coroner at
         Sheffield, Dr Popper, which deals with our role in respect of his
         Inquiry. I am also aware that Dr Popper has written to you separately
         about his Inquiry and how it may relate to matters of a criminal nature
         which arise out of the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. You
         may find it useful to have had sight of that letter before we arrive.

         I look forward to meeting you on Friday subject, of course, to no
         British Rail delays! Should we have any reason to be delayed I will
         telephone you on route.

         Yours sincerely

Mr. G.J. Dear, Q.P.M. D.L. LLB,

Dear Mr. Dear,

TrrT.TfiBOROPGH -DISASTER - CORONER*S INQUIRY.

As you will of course know I in common with other coroners in
the country have been and am still very well served by the
appropriate police forces in connection with coronal inquiries.
In my case, the police force usually involved is the South Yorkshire
Police. The inquiries as well as the preparation of documents etc.,
axe undertaken on a no charge basis.

However, in the matter of the Hillsborough Disaster, you have
been dealing with the matter on behalf of the Public Inquiry as well
as myself for reasons which I do not have to set out.

I understand that the oral evidence side of the Public Inquiry
is now probably over and understand that Lord Justice Taylor*s
interim report is expected shortly, and that consequently your
involvement as far as the Inquiry is concerned may diminish if not cease.

As you know, the inquiries on behalf of the coroner have not yet
been completed and I believe that considerable work has still to
be done before it will be possible for the necessary report(s) to
be prepared and handed over to me. In addition, I anticipate
that there will be quite a lot of other matters which will require
the attention and time of members of the police force before and
during the Inquest(s) and possibly though less likely, after
completion of these.

 It would I suppose be possible for the coronal inquiries no* to be
 +nw»r> over by the South Yorkshire Police and for them to handle them
 in the conventional manner. In this instance however, I think
 that it would be a grave mistake if this were to take place.

 I say this not because South Yorkshire would be incapable of carrying
 out such an inquiry nor because I have not been very well served both
 in the past as well as at present by South Yorkshire Police in the
 many inquiries which have and are being undertaken by them, but
 because rightly or wrongly, the South Yorkshire Police have been
 critized in connection with their hand! Ing of the disaster. Vere
 they now to take over the coronal inquiry, they as well as possibly
 myself would lay ourselves open to criticism over, for instance, possible
                                                                                             cont*d....

Chief Constable C.J. Dear (confd).




 lack of impartiality. The efforts of your force have been rightly
 praised at the Public Inquiry and I do not think that should be
 dissipated.

 Furthermore, in view of certain allegations which have been publicly
 made (and I express no view with regard to these allegations at the
 present time) I think that it would be unwise for South Yorkshire
 Police to take over the running of the coronal inquixy(s).

 I also think that a transfer of the inquiry to South Yorkshire
 at the present time would cause delay and probably duplication
 of effort which can be in nobody's interest.

 In all the circumstances I think that it would be best if you
 continasdto act as the coronal officers and continued to undertake
 the inquiry on behalf of the coroner on the usual basis, that is,
 no charge or cost until it is completed*

 I would also like to take this opportunity of saying what excellent
 help and relationship I have had from Mr. M. Jones and the members
 of his team, and it would be good to see it through to the end.

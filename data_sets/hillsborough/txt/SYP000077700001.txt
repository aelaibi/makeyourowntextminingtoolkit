Halfway           along          the    driveway             I saw       t h at     two    Police         officers,            who       I di d

them     to       continue             on    their          way.        Although          they     di d      so    I noticed             that

they     were         the        worse       for       d r i n k as      were       many     of     the      supporters           who         were

continuing                to     urinate          at    the       sides       of    the     driveway.

Under        normal            circumstances                 I would          consider           arresting          any     person

behaving            in s u c h a m a n n e r                but    there       was       so m a n y     of    them       it w as

gasping          for       breath,          coughing             violently and                  clutching            their          ch e s t s .         I

directed          a    number          of      these        people          to    sit      against           the     advertisement

1't w a s    obvious             that       these          injured          people         had       been      involved             in    crushing

trying       to       pull       the       fencing          apart        I realised                t h at    something              had    gone

seriously             wrong.           A    number          of O f f i c e r s          around        me all         realised             this       at

the    same       t i me     and       we      a ll    moved          towards           the     goals        but     by the           t i me    I got

there       it wa s         obvious            that        too m a n y         officers            trying       to    get       i n v o l v e d was

going       to    be a h i n d r e n c e .                 There       were       a number            of     supporters              around          the

goal    area          who    had       obviously                suffered minor                  injuries            and    I escorted

them    back          to    corner          of    the       ground where                  the      S t . Johns        Ambulancemen

were    st i l l       giving          first          aid       to    injured           supporters.

Whilst       I w as         doing          this       my a t t e n t i o n        became           drawn      to a news               cameraman

Some     of    these        supporters                were       quite         obviously             grief      stricken             but

others        were       obviously             worse        for     drink           and       their attitude               was       so

menacing        and       threatening                 that       I was         becoming          concerned            for       my       ow n

safety.         None        of      us     had     radios          so we         could         not    summon assistance

I tried        to    reason           with       the       supporters               that       they    were      not       helping              the

I was        returning           to      the     Leppings           Lane         end      I found        two     groups          of

supporters           and       stewards            wandering             about           with    stretchers-                   I told           them

             for       the    Football       Association.                     I went          along    with my          fourteen         year     old

 have     lunch and a               drink.                   I

 We    l ef t    the     pub at           about       2.15pm         (1415)         to m a k e      our w a y         to    the     ground

 which       is a b o u t      three        quarters             of a m i l e         away.      We      walked         along

 Penistone          Rd    then        turned          left       up P a r k s i d e     Rd     then        into C a t c h b a r           Ln    to

 make     our w a y       down        into       Leppings            Ln    turnstiles.              Whilst           we w e r e     walking

 to H i l l s b o r o u g h ,       I saw Notts                Barest         fans     drinking            from       b eer      cans      but

 there       was    no     problems             witjjr t h e m , as           we w a l k e d     further             on we       were

 approached             by Li verpocyr s u p p o r t e r s                 on a n u m b e r         of     occasions             asking         if

 we    had      tickets        for f k 1e . O n at                  l e ast     two    of    those         occasions             I could

 tell     that      the Li we r poo 1 s u p p o r t e r s                  had      been     drinking            but a g a i n        there

 was    no      problems        with        them.

 We    turned       into L e p p i n g s           Ln which a l th ou gh                busy with               people        making

 their       way    to    the       g r o un d was          easily         negotiable            u n ti l       we    got     to    the

 actual         entrance         to       the    ground.

 It w o u l d      n o w be     about 2.35pm                   (1435)         and     the    crowd waiting                  to     get-

 through         the     terrace           turnstiles               were      massed        together            from       the

 turnstiles             out    onto        the     edge        of    the L e p p i n g s       Ln     roadside,             so m u c h         so

 that     we     had     to    cros s       over       Leppings            Ln    to    go    round         them       to m a k e      our       way

 to    our      turnstile,            which        I think           was      turnstile          ’G ’ . In f act              after

 walking         round        t h e m we        had    to      then       struggle          through         a    l a rge      crowd        of

 Liverpool          fans       who        were    making            their       way    towards           the m a s s        of     people

 queueing          to    get     in t h r o u g h        terrace           turnstiles.              I was        surprised            at       the

 mass     of     people        st i l l     outside            the    g r o u n d at        that      t ime      on a       semi-final

 occasion.          It t oo k         a    purposeful               physical          effort        to     keep       the     f our       of    us

 together          during       t his       time       when         1 would         normally          expect          to w a l k      through

 a W Stand          turnstile              at    t hat      time wi t h o u t          any     problem.              In f act       because

 we    were      having        to     queue        I looked           behind          and    saw      that       there        were        still

 hundreds          of    people           arriving          in L e p p i n g s        Ln and        I actually              said      to

* many    f an s w e r e         arriving           late.

 We    eventually              got     into     the     ground         getting           on    for 2 . 5 0 p m        (1450)          a n d was

 making        our w a y         to    the     entrance          to    the W S t a n d w h e n             I saw Liverpoo 1

 fans     climbing             into      the    ground        o ver        the     turnstile             building         and     dropping

 down     to w a i t i n g        Policemen,            although            I did        hear       them       saying      they        had

 tickets.

 We    then made            our w a y        onto      the W S t a n d a n d a S t e w a r d                   showed      us w h e r e          to

 sit,     which was              in    row     16    immediately             behind           the    goal,       w h i c h we

 found       quite        easily,           but as      expected            the     W St and was               quite      full        at    this

 time.       We    sat      down       then     shortly afterwards                       the     players          came     out

 onto     the      pitch and Liverpool                       came      to     our    end.        During         the      k ick    in       I saw

 Bruce       G R O B B E L A R , the         Liverpool           goalkeeper              look       at    the     crowd and            I

 commented           on     how       ugly     his     face      was,       but     on    reflection              I think         he

 probably          saw w h a t         was     happening.

 As    the     teams        lined        up to       k ick    off      I saw        f ans       climbing          over     the        fence

 behind        the      goal      onto       the     track       and       I thought           at    t hat      t ime     t hat       there

 must     be      s ome     s ort      of    crush      down       in the          terraces,             although         I could           see

 that     there         was      plenty        of    room     on the          terraces           to m y        left.      I think           it

 was     also      about         t his      time     that     I became             aware       of    the       lar g e    number           of

 people        standing           in the        aisles        of      the W S t a n d ,          which         I c o u l d n ’t

 understand.              The     match        kicked        off a n d        then       I saw Police              Officers

 standing          on the w a l l            by the       fence        beckoning              the L i v e r p o o l       fans        to    stop

 pushing          and     to     pull       back.      I also         saw P o l i c e O f f i c e r s           pulling          people

 over     the      fe n c e ,     leading           to m o r e     and      mo/-l p e o p l e        climbing            over     of       their

 own accord.              Th e    nex t      thing      I remerj^Ber w a s               that L i verpool                hit     the       bar

 more     people          climbing           ovej/The         fence         to     get    out       of    the     terraces            a n d my

 thoughts          at     t hat       time     was     that as         a    result        of L i v e r p o o l        hitting

 the     bar,      there         had     been       a surge        in the          terraces.             The    next      thing        that

                    * s topped and           I saw more          people         getting        out       from     the     terraces          over      the

                     By    now there          were       people       l y ing     flat       out    on    the     pitch and           I saw      the

                     Police       a n d St J o h n s        people       giving         both mouth             to m o u t h a n d      heart

                     the    pitch,       making          it d i f f i c u l t     to    tell       who    was     h ur t a n d w h o        w a s n ’t a n d

                     to a t t e n d     to    the    injured.          I then          saw    the P o l i c e      a n d St J o h n s        people

                     they    put a       coat       over       him,    t hat      was       when    I realised            t hat      people      were

                     dying.

                     I then       realised          t hat      this    match would             never        be    re-started           so     I made        my

                     We    were     standing         by the         snack       bar     talking          about      what      had     happened         when

            FINAL;      LIVERPOOL V NOTTS FOREST,             PLAYED AT

            HILLSBOROUGH ON 9th April            1988,




            Sir; On the date shown above,              I was engaged on duties            in connection

            with the FA Cup %emi final, Liverpool v Notts Forest.

            On that date I was irX® serial            of men, mostly comprising the Rotherham
                                                           13>ST-
            A/ea Constables           led by PS^SJ'^I Pat Keenan,  O u r ^ d ^ i e s ^ n ^ ^ ^ of

            PoliSbi>ng the outside area of the Turnstiles at the entrance to the
\ Urv(iX                ^         ,
            ’L e p p i n g s X ^ n e y stand.   ihe area concerned was a rough triangle,               being

 1 ^ 5 ^    widest at the road and narrowing down towards the actual                         turnstiles

            We understood that supporters of Liverpool FC would be using                         ’o u r ”
                                                                             PAGE         2
                                                                             S3216

turnstiles.

Prior to taking up our duties we had a briefing,            given by Chief Sup *t

Mole.

We took up our duties at the turnstiles around 12 noon and at that

time    it was very quiet.

PS Keenan had split us into pairs,        each pair covering one turnstile

ent ranee,

As time progressed towards kick off          (3pm)   the situation got far

bu s i e r .   Liverpool fans arrived by the coachful and up to 2.30pm the

crowd f 1ow was heavy but without tr ou bl e.        The atmosphere was

generally jovial and *tongue       in cheeked * and I re-cal1 that we had

built up a fine pile of beer and lager cans            (all full) at the side of

the entrances,       taken from fans en                 round.

Between 30 mins before kick off u _____________ e of minutes after the

kick o f f , the s ituat ion altered dramat

arrived and within minutes a crush situation developed.             The

geographical       lay out of iiiose turnstiles was not conducive to large

numbers of people trying t                   ugh them, and very shortly,     all     of

the officers       in our serial          j o s h e d back firmly onto the w a l l

where the actual       turnstile gaps are.    We were fairly helpless to react

to any situation but we were fortunate          in that, although the

atmosphere was boisterous and reeking of alcohol,            the general mood of

those     people remained happy.

A large part of that crush was caused by people trying to use the

turnstile whose number was shown on their ticket, when in fact all of

the turnstiles       led to the same standing area within the ground.          The

stewards on the turnstiles were told to let people through just as

long as they had a ticket for the enclosure and once we were able to

communicate this to the crowds,       they quickly and safely entered the

g round.
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          33216

At no time did we operate any type of cordon system to relieve the

crush.    Such a system would have been totally impracticable          in such a

dense crush,    one just gets swept along with the crowd until one hits a

wal I .

At no time were any of the main gates opened.            I do not know whether

there were other officers      inside the ground directing fans to various

enclosures,    but later on I saw the entire crowd in the Leppings Lane

stand and it seemed very well shared out albeit f u l l , with a slight

excess of numbers directly behind the goal.

During the match itself,     our serial was called upon ad-hoc to deal

with spontaneous bits of trouble but nothing related to mass crowd

trouble, merely minor disputes.

I have visited 82 football      league grounds    in England.     I have always

considered Hillsborough one of the safest and best.             I know the ground

very well and the only detremental aspect of the entrance facility is

the narrowing triangular forecourt       leading to the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.

On 9 April    1988, my feelings after the crush I had experienced were of

relief    it was over.   It was h o t , breathless,   s wea ty, painful and

smelly,    ingredients one quite readily accepts on semi final day,           (viz

if it were not crowded and jostly it would be s tr ang e) and as such I

do believe that no one from my serial made any representations about

the crush situation.

After the match had finished,      we were delegated public order duties

around the ground.       I did not witness any trouble.       I made no arrests,

the mood of the crowd remaining carnival         like.

             On S a tur day,          15th April          1989,     (150489)       I was     on duty at H i l l s b o r o u g h

             A m ai n briefing            headed by Ch.             Supt.     D u c k e n f i e l d was   held    in the North

             w hi ls t    in the N o r t h S t an d           I spoke w i t h S er ge an t                C h a p m a n who was

             in charge          of serial         1.      This    serial       consisted       of 20 C o n s t a b l e s      who

             were    d e ta i le d     to w ork        round the       p erimeter        track.       T hese     officers were

             all F 1 C o m m u n i t y C o n s t a b l e s who w or k e d          this     particular         duty for every

             m a t c h at H i l l s b o r o u g h .       I went      t h r ou gh the m a tc h order w it h PS

             C h a p m a n and     he stated           there were        no   problems.          I did     not a ll oc at e

             part ic ul ar       gates      for    individual          officers.          This       I left    to PS Chapman,

             t ho u g h   I understand            that       these o ff icers work           in the same          position

             each week.            S e r g e a n t C h a p m a n then took his serial                  onto    the     perimeter

             t rack.
At    '1055 a m      I spoke       to the whole             of the     serial      2 in the N o r t h Stand.

I w ent      t h r ou gh the       details         of the m a t c h order,            leaving                the sergeants

to    i d entify o ff i c e r s         for     particular        duties.         I s tr essed to these

o ff i c e r s    that t he y      needed         to be f ully a w a r e o f the e m e r g e n c y

evacuation           proce du re s and            pointed out        to them the fact that the upper

s e c t i on of the S o u t h S t a n d was made m a i n l y                of timber and any                                   risk of

fire was g r ea te st             at that end.

At    1110 a m        I spoke      to the w hole            of serial      in the upper                      level              of the

S o u t h S t a n d w h i c h was w here             that    serials     duties were.                        The          briefing

was    the same as for Serial                      2, a g ai n the S e r g e a n t               having         the

r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of giving           individual        offic er s      their            particular                      duties

in    line w i t h        the     order.

At    1120 a m        I   b r i ef ed the stewards who were work in g                             in     the         S outh S tand
                                                                             —    mill '<   in         I I M B W IM I —   — m M m r o n i i i ii in m   >


both upper a nd             lower       levels.         This    took    place       in the upper                          level              of

the S o u t h Stand.              I e x p l a i n e d to the       stewards        the            procedures                    to be

f o ll o w e d    in the        event       of an e m e r g e n c y e v a c u a t i o n after w h i c h                         I a sk ed

if there wre any queries                        or doubts.         There were               none.             I reminded

t hem that their                duties were          in the S o u t h S ta nd w h i c h was                         c on st ructed

m a i n l y of w oo d a n d        that any          l i ke li ho od of a fire                   in the ground was

g r ea t es t at the            end.        I e x p l a i n e d that a capacity                   crowd was                  expec te d

a nd that         sa fe ty was         of    paramount       importance and that                       it was                essential

that     the      stewards        a nd Police must work                in close             liaison.                  If there

was a ny hint of a n y                 problems       they were        told to        contact a Police

O ff ic er       of w h i c h    there were          over 20 w o r ki ng         in that stand.                              I asked

the stewards              if they had an y que st io ns                or a n t i c i p a t e d an y problems at

that     stage.           Two     problems were             i d en ti fi ed by stewards who hd wo rk ed

the Semi          Final     the    previous year,              these weres

Following           that     b ri e f i n g    I spoke       to the S e r g e a n t s      in S e r ia ls 2 an d 3,

advised        them of         these         two    points and        instr uc te d them to             inform

s o me ti me       before 2       pm     (1400)       v is it in g    the      room under         the S ou th S ta nd

where      the      cameras       an d       crowd    counting m a c h i n e r y         is held.           The   comment

was made           by some on e         in there       that     there were          12,000        in the g ro u nd at

that      time,      a nd at      the        same    time    the     previous year             there    had been

20,000       in the        ground.

Sometime around 2                  pm    (1400)       I n o t ic ed      problems were            being      ex pe ri en c ed

had an e a rpiece              extension            in use.        I took       this     off    but    it made          no

difference^.            I m ade my way               to the     'tunnel'         an d spoke w ith

and made           s imilar      comment.            He then st at ed that               he w o ul d go to the

P o l i c e C on tr ol       R o o m and advise             the staff          of the     problem.           As he was

a bo ut    to go      I saw one of the                 radio       t ec hn ic ia ns walk in g a long              the

crowd had c o n t i n u e d             to    rise and the noise                they were         creating was

c ons i.derabl e .           R e c e p t i o n o f radio m es sa ge s            was     poor due       to the noise

At 2.40        pm    (1440)       I was at           the    players tunnel              when    I d e c i d e d to walk

round the           per im et er       track for the          last      time       before    the    commencement

of the match.               I w a l k e d along         the S o u t h S t a n d and towards L ep pi ng s

L ane      terrace.         The L ep pi ng s Lane            t e r r ac in g was      becoming       full,      t hough

t here was          still       room for further             people,       p a r ti cu la rl y outside          the

moved       to the L e p p i n g s       Lane end,         which       I refused.           Speaking       to them at

a d istance          of some 3 feet              proved di ff ic ul t          due to the noise                 the

time w ou ld be a b o u t 2 . 3 3               pm   (1453)     and     the    players had either               just

come onto           the    pitch or were about                to.       I i nstructed PC G ro om who was

on the gate n e a r e s t              to these s u pp or te rs          to escort          them to an area             in

the S p io n Ko p near              to the N o r t h S t a n d w hi ch had been s p e c ia ll y

w h i c h w ould      be my        p os ition during          the      game with S er ge a n t         Chapman.

The time was              just a bout 3 pm and               the game         ready to start.              I was

u naware at that                time    that     there were         or had been any             problems        with

sure       if this was           due    to     continued      int er fe re nc e       on the       radio      or the

v olume      of noise           g e n e r a t e d by the     crowd.        I think         it was    probably a

c o m b i na ti on of       the     two.       The    game    had been u nd erway for a few minutes

and     I was at          the    track       perimeter       near      to tunnel.           Supt.    G r e e n w o o d was

            br in gi ng       bodies     out      From the terrace and take                     them onto the                 pitch.        I

            d id not k now w h i c h were                  dead and w h i c h were         simply unconscious;,                      I

            just h elped          to    pull      them from the             terrace and take             them onto             the       pich

            a t t e nd i ng    to them.           O nl y    slowly as the           dead and        injured were               brought

            onto      the     pitch did        it become          s li g h t l y easier        to bring more fro m the

            terrace,          t h r o u g h the    gate and onto             the    pitch.      I a l t e r n a t e d between

            assisting with              this and helping               others who were              climbing           over the

             p erimeter        fencing.           I lost all          track     of time as this             c on tinued until

             the     central      section         of the terrace             had been      cleared.              D ur i n g    this

             time     I cannot         recall       having      heard any          radio messages,               but    the noise

             from     the g ro un d was           deafening.           W he n the       terrace was          clear        there were

            m an y of the         fans    obviously            in a very d i s t r e s s e d        state,        some were

             crying t o get her          in groups,            others were          shouting abuse at Police

            officers - some abuse was                        d ir ec te d at       blaming Police O f f i c e r s               for

            w ha t    had happened.               That      c riticism was always               d ir e c t e d     in the terms

             ’I t ’s your        fault,     y ou should have                g iven us more t i c k e t s ’ .

             I became a ware            that a police             cordon had been formed                   towards            the Spion

South       side     of    the centre          I could see           there were         people         crushed up

against        the    p er imeter         fencing.         Some were             obv io us ly unconscious,             m any

PETER COLIN DARLING


POLICE INSPECTOR

 HAMHERTON ROAD




On Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on duty at Hillsborough Football Grounfl in
connection with the Semi Final Cup tie between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
I was in charge of sub sector 1 which covered serials 1, 2 and 3« In broad terms
these serials covered the following duties within the ground-
Serial 1   Perimeter Track
Serial 2   South Stand lower level
Seraa 1 3 South Stand upper level

A main briefing headed by Ch Supt Duckenfield    was held in the North Stand at 10am
after which officers took their meal. At 10.k5 am whilst in the North Stand I spok
with Sergeant        Chapman who was in charge of serial 1. This serial consisted of 20
Constables who were detailed to work round the perimeter track. These officers Here
all F1 community constables who worked this particular duty for every match at
Hillsborough. I weruct through the match order with Ps Chapman and he satated there
were no problems. I did not allocate particular gates for individual    officers. This
I left to PS Chapman, though I understand that these officers work in the same position
each week. Sergeant Chapman then took his serial onto the perimeter track.
At 10.55am I spoke    to the whole of serial 2 in the North Stand. I went through the
details of the match order, leaving the sergeants to identify officers for particular
duties. I stressed to these officersthat they needed to be fully aware of the emergency
evacuation procedures and pointed out to them the fact that the upper section of the
 South Stand was made mainljr of timber and any risk of f&re was greatest at that end.
At 11.10£m I spoke to the whole of serial in the upper level of the South Stand which
was where that serial’s duties were. The briefing was the same as for serial 2, again
the Sergeant having the responsibility of giving individual officers their particular
duties in line with the order.
         At 11.20affl I briefed the stewards who were working in the South Stand, both
upper and lower levels. This took place in the upper level of the      South Stand. I
explained to the stewards the procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency
evacuation wui     after which I asked if there were any queries or doubts. There were none •
I reminded them that their duties were in the South Stand which x was constructed mainly
of wood and that       khxgMzMiamx ttoac liklihood of a fire in the ground was greatest at
that end. I explained that a capacity crowd was expected and that safety was of
paramount importance and that it was essential that the stewards and Police must work in
close liaison. If there was any hint of any problems thajr were told to contact a Police
Officer of which there were over 20 working in that stand. I asked the stewards if they
had   any questions or anticipated any problems at that stage. Two problems were identified
by stewards who had worked the Semi Final the previous year, these were      -
1.Supporters without tickets jumping over the turnstiles.
2.Exit aisles from the stands being congested during the game by officers taking        up
positions there.
Following that briefing I spoke to the sergeants in Serials 2 and 3 « advised them of these
two points and instructed then to inform constables under their command accordingly.
From that moment I patrolled those areas I had responsibility for i.e. South Stand and
perimeter track. There was a slow build up of crowd from that time       ,though it appeared
that Nottingham Forest supporters were arriving in greater numbers than the Liverpool
supporters. I made comment on this to several officers as I spoke to them during my patrol.
I recall sometime before 2pm visiting the room under the South Stand where the cameras and
crowd counting machinery is held. The     comment was made by soeone in there that there
were 12,000 in the ground at that time , and at the same time the previous year there had
been 20,000 in the ground.
Sometime around 2pm a noticed problems were being experienced with         fj radio. There
was an inermitent buzzing typ<t noise which made    receptioffery poor and difficult to
understand. At this time I had an earpiece extension in use, I took this off but it made no
difference. I made my way to the ’tunnel* and spoke with Superintendent Greenwood and
Sergeant Chapman. They confirmed that they were experiencing similar problems. Inspector
Harvey joined us and made similar      comment. He then stated that   that he would go to
the Police Control Room and advise the staff of the problem. As he was about to go Isaw
one of the radio technicians walking along the perimeter track towards me. He was with a
Police Officer, I believe Ch Insp Beal and they stated they were on the may to the Control
Boom to sort out the problem. By 2.30pm the size of the criwd had continued to rise and
the noise they were creating was considerable. Reception of radio messages was poor
due to the noise created by the crowd and the interference earlier described.
At 2.if0pm I was at the players tgrnnel when I decided to walk round the perimeter track for t
the last time before the commencement of the match. I walked along the      South   Stand end
towards Leppings Lane terrace.    The Leppings Lane terracing was becoming filled, though
                                                                        page 3            ,i S
                                                                                      ^y\\



there was still room for further people, particularly      outside the central two pens
which were almost full, but were not posing any undue problems or concern. There were
 a number of officers on the perimeter track along Leppings       ane at the time , though
I cannot recall wxactly which ones. I made my way along the Leppings Lane end , along
the North   tStand    and down towards the   Spion Kop end. As I walked along the Spion
Kop end b Liverpool supporters attracked my attention. They were obviuosly at the
’wrong end’. They asked to be moved to the Leppings ^ane end , which I refused. Speaking
to them at a distance of some 5 feet proved flifficult due to the noise — the time would
be    about 2.55pB and the players had either just come onto the pitch or were about to.
I instructed Pc Groom who was on the     gate nearsest to these supporters to escort them
to an area in the Spion Kop nearto the Nofcth Stand which had been specially          earmarked
for depositing Liverpool supporters who had got into the Spion Kop terrace.           There
were already   a number of Liverpool supporters in that section. I then made my way to
the players tunnel which would be my position during the game with Sergeant Chapman.
The time was just about 3p® and the game ready to start . .            I was unaware at that
time that there were/anyhprolflms with supporters outside the ground at the Leppings Lane
end. I am not sure if this was due to continued interference on the radio or the
volume of noise generated by the crowd. I think it was probably a combination.of the two.
The game had been underway for a few minutes and I was at the track perimeter near to
the tunnel. Supt. Greenwood was also there and we were moving on a number of photographer,
who were congregating around the tunnel waiting for Mr Clough, the Nottingham Forwst
manager to take up his position in seats immediately behind the ’dug out’.
As the photographers were moved on it would be about 3*055® and I was about to take my
 place   just iaside the tunnel when I looked towards the Leppings       ane terracing and
saw what appeared to be some sort of commotion taking place immediately behind the goal.
I made my way round to that location, Supt Greenwood was some 20 yards in front of me,
     {h’ i§ tw?Setg4heie S ^ g eSfe4 a e?erSS?e 85 ?6SiS5«t6, 5fdSWfttK , i« itr .    I cou Id
see there were people crushed up against the perimeter fencing. Some were obviously
\inconscious, many othersclearly could not mave at all       and were having difficulty
 breathing. The gate which gave access to this pens was open and officers            were trying
 to pull people through. I went to the gate and tried to assist but the gate was
so narrow that only    a certain number of officers could be effective , otherwise            we
were simply getting in each others way. Just inside the gate I could see that injured
people were pilled on to    of each other , unable to move. Police officers were pulling
them out and onto the perimeater     track, but this was proving difficult as many of
the injured in thads Pile of bodies jusjr inside the gate were unconscious and unable to
assist themselves     in any way. I stood on the advertising boards on the perimeter track
and shouted to the crowd further back to push backwards. '-^he mood of a large section
of this crowd was angry, and they were shouting abuse back at me.        Some fans on the
outside of the central pen managed to climb over the metal fence into the outer pen
                                                                                 page b
  »                                                                                  gL.~■ v
                                                                                     f
and I remember that there was sufficient room in the outer pen for them to gsJc            climb
down from the fence fairly easily. Some officers had made their way into this outer pen
and were assisting people over.        Despite this there was still many people crushed and
unable to move       at the front of the cebter pen. One or two managed to    climb over
 the perimeter fence and onto the track. I went back to the gate and         started to assist
bringing bodies out from the terrace and take them onto the pitch.         I difl not know
which were dead and which were simply imconsciaus , I jsut helped to pull them from the
terrace and take them onto the pitch where other officers, St John         Ambulance staff and
©thers    wer® attending to them. Only slowly as the      dead and incurred were brought onto
the pitch did it become slightly easier to bring more from the terrace , through the gate
                            a
and onto the pitch. I altermed between assisting wth this and helping otheu who
were climbing over the perimeter fencing. I lost all track of time as this continued
until the central section of the terrace had been cleared. During this time I cannot
recall having heard       any radio messages, but the noise from the grounfl was deafening.
When the terrace was clear there were many of the fans        obviously in a very distressed
state, some were crying together in groups, others were shouting abuse at Police of icers
- fcks some abuse was directed at blaming Police officers for what had happened. That
criticism was always directed in the        terms   * Its your fault, you should have given
us more tickets.•
 ife     I became aware that a police cordon had been formed towards the Spion Kop         end
 preventing Liverpool supporters going to that end. As order began to slowly restore
andvthe gxxiut       pitch cleared of bodies I tried to assemble a serial of officers      ±x
         together.    Those I assembled were officers mainly from serial     2. We then assisted
in slowly clearing the pitbh after it was announced that the match had been cancelled.
After the pitch was cleared I did not assist in any particular duty.

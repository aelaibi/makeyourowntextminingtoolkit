HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL BELL


I am writing further to my note of 5 July. At this point in the financial year we are unable
to highlight any non-running cost subhead from which this expenditure could be vired. It is
also unlikely, given their projected overspend, that the Fire Service College will be able to
help although they will look at the position again later in the year.

2.      My reason in returning to you is to ask again if there is any other source of funding
from which the £37k could be provided. You made the point in your note of 26 June that
provision should have been sought in PES. However, the final bill for the legal costs of the
Hillsborough Steering Committee, was not presented for payment until 31 January 1990.
The Home Office Inquiry Team disbanded on 9 February 1990. Even with the knowledge
that the bill would be disputed it would have been too late for a PES bid for 1990/91 and
certainly it would not have been anticipated that the matter would not be resolved until
1991/92.

 3.     I realise that an underspend in 1989/90 on the Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry subhead
 of £297k and £100k in 1990/91 on the Football Licensing Authority subhead cannot be used
 now but nevertheless it would be appreciated if you could advise me if another source could
 be found.

 4.     I should perhaps mention that the payment of £33,070.40 has been made from a
 suspense account to Cuff Roberts North Kirk, Solicitors.

 5.         I look forward to hearing from you although I fear the news will not be good.

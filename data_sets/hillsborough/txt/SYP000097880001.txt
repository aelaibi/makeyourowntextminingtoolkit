the    assistance           of M o u n t e d        Officers          the      situation was                 eased

shouted       comments          to     the     Police        Officers           that       if       the

the    disaster.                Whilst       in the       premises           he    heard a                conversation

between          three men          sat      nearby.           Two    of     the m e n           spoke          with

Liverpool          accents          and      he a s s u m e d      they were               supporters               of       that

club.        He    heard         them     talk      about       Leppings           Lane          and       that         they

would       meet       up w i t h      others       outside          the L e p p i n g s             Lane

outside          the    public, house.               He w o u l d       estimate                that       25      of    them

were     Liverpool              supporters.              He    got    into        conversation with

two    of    them.          They       did    not    mention          tickets,              neither             did

Mr.    MARJORAM            see    them       in    possession           of    one.              At 2 . 4 5         pm

       joined         by Mr.          MARJORAM           sometime,              he     says,      after         2.00     pm.

       He    corroborates                that       one       of     the       two L i v e r p o o l       supporters

       he a n d Mr.             MARJORAM were                 talking           to     said words           to    the     effect

       that      they were             confident              of     getting           into    the        ground       because

       the      gate       would       be     open       or     opened.              The m a n n e r       in w h i c h    this

       remark         was       made     did       not     suggest             that     they      intended         to     force

       entry         into       the    gr o u n d .        He      describes            the    two m e n as            decent

       persons            and    they       di d    not       say       t hat     they      had      tickets       for     the

       match and            he    did       not     see       them        in    possession             of any.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER 15TO APRIL, 1989

I have to report that I have been investigating the behaviour pattern of
Liverpool Football Club Supporters at matches played away fran home. I
have limited this enquiry to the 1987/88 and 1988/89 Football Seasons.

There have been a number of areas which I have looked at including the
behaviour of fans on the day of the disaster. I have categorised the
various enquiries and will outline the sailient points under each heading.

1.      POLICE REPORTS CONCERNING LIVERPOOL AWAY MATCHES WHERE PROBLEMS
         HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WITH LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

1.1     Everton versus Liverpool, the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
         on 10 May 1986. There was a capacity crowd of 98,000. Over
         1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in possession
         of forged tickets. 25 Police Officers were injured.

1.2     Tottenham Hotspur versus Liverpool on 28 November 1987. Enquiries
        with New Scotland Yard Public Order Branch and having seen the Police
        Report on this match,it was declared 'all ticket1 with a capacity
        crowd of 47,363. A total of 10,311 Liverpool Supporters visited
        White Hart Lane out of which 2,000 Liverpool Supporters were
        locked out of the ground. This group caused policing problems
        in that shop windows were broken in Tottenham High Road but they
        were eventually dispersed into an underground station.

1.3     Watford versus Liverpool on 13 February 1988. This match was
         declared 'all ticket' with a total crowd attendance of 23,838
         which included 6,200 Liverpool fans. 1,500 Liverpool fans, some
         of whom had been drinking, arrived without tickets. Given that
         it would have presented severe policing difficulties and problems
         were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and run the town of
         Watford and frequent local public houses, consultations between
         Club Officials and the Match Conrmander ended in a decision to
         allow the fans into the ground on payment.

1.4     Liverpool versus Wimbledon the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
        on 14 May 1988. Again there was a capacity crowd of 98,000, 92
        fans were arrested, 85 of them from Liverpool. Over 3,000 persons
        were ejected from the Stadium for possession of either forged
        tickets or no tickets at all. The Stadium authorities recovered
        478 forged tickets. Seven Police Officers were injured. The
        majority of those rejected were Liverpool fans and the majority
        of forged tickets were presented by Liverpool supporters.

1.5     Southampton versus Liverpool on 24 Sep tarter 1988. This match
        was declared 'all ticket'. 150 Liverpool fans arrived without
        tickets. Those fans were isolated outside the ground and again
        because manpower would have been soaked up by allowing the fans
        to roam Southampton, they were allowed into the ground on payment,
        after discussions between the Match Commander and Club Officials.
Arsenal versus Liverpool on 9 November 1988. The Match Commanders
report that a capacity crowd attended the match with approximately
6,000 fans being locked out of the Stadium. The kick-off was
delayed for 15 minutes to allow the fans to get into the ground.
Many of the locked out fans attempted to climb or break into the
Stadium. Reinforcements had to be called in. Not all of the
locked out fans were Liverpool supporters.

Southampton versus Liverpool on 12 December 1988. This match
was also declared 1all ticket1. 750 Liverpool fans arrived at
the ground without tickets. Many related a story of being unable
to purchase a ticket from the Office at Liverpool because it had
not been opened to sell tickets for a sufficiently long enough
period. The ticketless fans were isolated and although the situation
was tense for a while the Southampton Football Club agreed to
open a turnstile and after payment allow all the fans into the
ground.

Millwall versus Liverpool on 29 January 1989. The match was declared
'all ticket', with a crowd of 23,615 of which 2,900 were Liverpool
supporters. Several hundred Liverpool supporters attended without
tickets and forged tickets were being sold outside the ground.
No other problems were encountered.

Hull City versus Liverpool on 18 February 1989. This was an F.A.
Cup Round and a particularly troublesome match for the Section
Commander in charge of the Liverpool fans. Forged tickets were
in evidence and a number of fans arrived without tickets. There
was evidence that the majority of Liverpool fans had been drinking
heavily. 100 ticketless fans outside the ground rushed a gate,
when it was being opened by Stewards to allow someone to leave
the ground, and at the same time Liverpool fans inside the ground
also rushed the gate and attempted to pull it wide open. With
the assistance of Mounted Officers the situation was eased but
ticketless fans outside, when the turnstiles were closed, shouted
carments to the Police Officers that if the turnstiles were not
opened they would rip the gates off and 'nobody closed doors on
Liverpool supporters'.

Norwich City versus Liverpool on 1 April 1989. This match was
declared 'all ticket' but information was received by the Club
that 1,272 tickets allocated to Liverpool had not been sold and
would be returned to Norwich on the team bus on the day of the
match. A number of Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets
and gave varying reasons for not knowing the match was 'all ticket'
or that they had cane from areas distant fran Liverpool. It was
decided to sell the 1,272 unsold tickets returned by the
Liverpool Club to get them into the ground. All the tickets were
sold although it is believed some Norwich supporters also
benefitted this way and got into the ground.
Wimbledon versus Liverpool on 13 May 1989. This match was declared
'all ticket' with a capacity crowd of 14,730 of which 6,473 were
Liverpool supporters. Enquiries with the Public Order Branch
at New Scotland Yard reveal that Liverpool F.C. was allocated
6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for supporters to
be advised by means of local radio and the press that the fixture
was an 'all ticket' one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned
to Wimbledon F.C. On the day, nearly 6,500 Liverpool supporters
attended the game, excluding a number who entered the hone supporters
parts of the Stadium. It was clear that a large number of
Liverpool supporters attended without tickets despite publicity
before the match. Turnstiles were opened to facilitate those
supporters who had come without tickets.

Everton versus Liverpool on 20 May 1989. This was the F.A. Cup
Final played at the Wembley Stadium, some 5 weeks after the
Hillsborough Disaster. The report from the Section commander
tends to show that Liverpool supporters had not learned from this
disaster. Ticketless fans caused considerable problems for the
Police and when they were clearing the area of those fans, bottles
and cans were thrown at them. Just before the end of the game
all gates to the Stadium were opened in preparation for the exodus.
An equalising goal was then scored by Everton which resulted in
an influx of fans who had been leaving and also those still around
the ground without tickets. All managed to get into bays around
the Stadium to watch extra time.

Detailed reports are attached under Appendix 'A'.


WITNESS STATEMENTS WHICH SHCW HCW CERTAIN LIVERPOOL FANS INTENDED
TO GET INTO THE MATCH

Julie Dawn SHELLEY is a part-time barmaid who assists behind the
bar at her         licensed promises, The Matilda Public House,
Matilda Street, Sheffield. Fran mid-day on the day of the disaster,
she had a conversation with three to four male persons who described
themselves as Liverpool supporters. They told her they had cane
fran Liverpool on the train, had no tickets for the match but
it was their intention to go to Hillsborough and gain entry.
They further told her that it was easy because they had done it
previously and there were other Liverpool fans who had cone down
with them without tickets who were going to get into the ground
as well. They left the public house by taxi to the ground between
2.30pm and 2.45pm.

Garry TAYLOR who is a retired Sales Director was drinking in The
Sicey Public House, Sicey Avenue, Sheffield, some 1% miles fran
the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the disaster. Whilst in
the promises he heard a conversation between three men sat nearby.
Two of the men spoke with Liverpool accents and he assumed they
were supporters of that club. He heard them talk about Leppings
Lane and that they would meet up with others outside the Leppings
Lane entrance. They would organise as many other people as possible
to cause whatever trouble they could. If enough trouble was caused
the gates would have to be opened. Mr. TAYLOR concluded that
this had happened before and the person doing the talking appeared
confident that this action could be forced. More detailed evidence
can be read in his statement.
Peter Kevan MARJORAM is a Company Director who visited The Pheasant
Public House, Oughtibridge, sane 2^ miles from the Hillsborough
Stadium, on the day of the disaster. He arrived at 2.35pm to
find numerous persons both inside and outside the public house.
He would estimate that 25 of them were Liverpool supporters.
He got into conversation with two of them. They did not mention
tickets, neither did Mr. MARJORAM see them in possession of one.
At 2.45pm he mentioned to the two that they were leaving it late
to get to the ground and one of them replied 'Don't worry about
that, we know either a gate will be open or opened'. Both men
laughed at each other. The two left shortly afterwards.

              is a Quantity Surveyor who was also in The Pheasant
Public House on the date of the disaster and was joined by Mr.
MARJORAM sometime, he says, after 2.00pm. He corroborates that
one of the two Liverpool supporters he and Mr. MARJORAM were talking
to said words to the effect that they were confident of getting
into the ground because the gate would be open or opened. The
manner in which this remark was made did not suggest that they
intended to force entry into the ground. He describes the two
men as decent persons and they did not say that they had tickets
for the match and he did not see them in possession of any.

Statements fran the four witnesses are attached to this report
under Appendix 'B '.


SCHEDULE SHCWING EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE GIVEN FRCM WITNESSES REGARDING
LIVERPOOL FANS ATTENDING THE MATCH WITHOUT TICKETS

There is ample evidence of fans arriving at this match without
tickets to get into the Hillsborough Ground. Attached is a schedule
showing that 25 Police Officers have subnitted reports showing
numerous fans without tickets, fans asking for spare tickts, fans
asking for the tickets of those arrested, evidence of fans coming
to the match expecting to buy tickets from touts, evidence of
fans having tickets snatched, evidence of seeing stubs fran tickets
being thrown back into the crowd and evidence of persons complaining
of having their tickets stolen.

The 25 reports submitted showing this evidence appears to be only
'the tip of the iceberg'. Further reports are still being processed
fran other officers which will no doubt contain a lot of similar
material.

Further evidence in relation to this matter can be given by civilian
witnesses listed under Appendix 'B'.

4.     EVIDENCE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF FANS AT THE SEMI FINAL MATCH BETWEEN
        NORWICH AND EVERTON PLAYED AT VILLA PARK ON 15TH APRIL 1989

4.1    A statement from Chief Superintendent Mellor, the Match Commander
        at the Sami Final match played the same day between Norwich City
        and Everton at Villa Park, showing the behaviour of the fans,
        especially those supporting Everton, together with two of his
       Mounted Officers is attached.

4.2    Whilst the evidence does not have any bearing on the match played
       between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, or the
        fans who attended the match, the Everton supporters behaviour
        at Villa Park shows a remarkable coincidence with the Liverpool
        supporters at Hillsborough which may indicate sane Liverpool
        characteris tic.

4.3    Statements fran the three Police Officers are attached and have
        been listed under Appendix 'D'.


5.     OBSERVATIONS AND CCMMENTS

5.1    It does appear that there is a nucleus of Liverpool supporters
        (unidentified) who do travel to matches played away fran Liverpool
        without tickets and cause severe policing problems. At the end
        of the day, rather than soak up Police manpower, it is felt better
        to allow them into the ground, if possible, rather than them cause
        havoc in the town, their team is playing. Whilst there is no
        direct evidence to support this, the fans do appear to know this.
        In the case at Watford where numerous ticketless fans arrived
        they did imply that if they were not granted admission to the
        ground they would go into Watford and cause havoc.

5.2    The evidence in the attached reports etc., has been gathered fran
       material in possession of the South Yorkshire Police. Given the
        opportunity to read and study the many civilian statements taken
        by the West Midlands Investigation Team, it may be that the
        evidence to hand could be enhanced further.

5.3    Since the 1 January, 1989, the F.A. Cup match played at Hull and
        the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley both show a similarity in
        crowd behaviour to that displayed on the date this disaster occurred.

  RE:      LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

  Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
  played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
  13 February 1988, the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
  included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

  Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
  this particular game.  I was responsible for policing outside the
  Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx­
  imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had arrived without tickets.   The
  game, which had been declared 'All Ticket' at Police instigation, was
  well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
  attending were in possession of tickets. Some of the 1,500 fans had
  been drinking and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
  behaviour was generally good. The prevailing weather, without doubt,
  assisted the policing of the crowd and after consultation with
  Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to’ hold the 1,500 supporters in the
  Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
  Stadium. Given that it would have presented severe policing
  difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
  run the town and frequent local public houses. After further consul­
  tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
  prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment.   I was aware
  that there would be sufficient room in the Stadium to accommodate
  these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
  I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
  attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates. The match was
  relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
  and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

  At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
  visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
  Stadium.

     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws etc.:



         Searching carried out at turnstiles. Escorts to Shuttle Trains from Stadium
         to Watford Junction. Large number of Liverpool Supporters travelled back into
         London on the Local trains* No problems.

         The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non-ticket holders was a
         success and will be done at future all-ticket games where this is likely to
         prove a problem.

The g en eral behaviour o f the fans at the turnstiles Iwas peaceful but; '-:4.,;
it was evident that the majority of the Liverpool fans had been
drinking intoxicants heavily,.

I was informed by Stewards from inside the ground that several i                                           i

there was a danger of them being serious ;.v in ju re d along w ith polioelt^

            I am Police Sergeant                            j a mounted officer with the West Midlands
            Police. On Saturday 15th. April 19&9 I was with other Mounted
            officers posted to Villa Park Football ground, Birmingham, to assist
            police the semi-final football match between Norwich and Everton.
            I was posted as the officer incharge of the mounted contingent
            required to control the supporters entering the ground via R and S
            block turnstiles and escorting the supporters from Witton Railway
            Station to che football ground, only Everton supporters were allowed
            access to the ground by R and S block. All Mounted officers were on
            post at R and S block by 1330 hours. Between 1330 hours and 1M *0 hours
             the supporters using R and S block arrived in small groups and there
            were no problems gaining access through the turnstiles. At about
             iMfO hours the crowd began to increase at R and S block and in order
             to prevent crushing on the steps, myself and two other Mounted officers
             blocked off the bottom of the steps and directed all supporters up
             an adjacent ramp which facilitated better queuing. By about 1515 hours
             a n the Everton supporters at R and S block had gained access to the
             football ground.I did not encounter any form of dissorder at R and S
             Block turnstiles while I was present,,

fran them.    They took the trouble to secrete them in shoes, socks and
other places, which made it difficult when production was demanded. The
nuifaer of street robberies for this event are much higher than for similar
events.

Ttere were now seme 300 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
have tickets but were still anxious to find a way into the.Stadiisn. Rather
'than leaving the ryyflfon as a fixed target, I decided to commence a sweep
of thff concourse,, pushing these fans towards the Royal Tunnel and away
fran the vulnerable area.

When the sweep from the other side, turnstiles JA' to 'Ef, reached the
Royal Tunnel, the crowd which numbered about* 500 began throwing bottles
aral m n s at police. A nurrtoer of arrests were made during the completion
of the sweep.

Despite the sweep, small pockets of ticketlese fans returned to the concourse
during the progress of the game. At about half time, there was a determined
attempt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadium
Offices and turnstile ’H ’. This was successfully repelled.

Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadivm were °P®n®°
in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
and fans were starting to leave.     However, the equalising goal was then
scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
and aicn those still around the ground without tickets. All managed to
get into bays around the Stadiun to watch extra time.

 The nunfcer of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadiun, does not fully
 reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Rather a balance
 is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
 the number of police left to control the crowd.

 On this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool and Everton
 supporters.   Had this not been the case, I believe much greater disorder
 would have emanated from the section of fans determined to gain entrance
 to tte Stadium, regardless of the cost in any terms, to others.

 Having described a lot of bad behaviour on the part of sane fans, I should
 say that the majority were well behaved and concerned for the safety of
 themselves and others*

                 went     down       to    help    her     out.

                 We    opened        the    pub at a b o u t 1 1 . 3 0 a m        (1130)        and      business         was    quiet.

                 At    12 m i d d a y      <1200)       about      3 or 4 Liverpool                 supporters          came     into          the

                 pub,     they       ordered       their         drinks    and    stood        by    the      bar,     talking        to me,

                 they     i n f o r m e d me      that     they were         Liverpool          supporters            and     t h e y all           had

                 Liverpool           accents,        they were           dressed     casually            not     in the L i v e r p o o l

                 Whilst        they were          in the         pub    they were        well       behaved        in g o o d    humour          and

                 could       be d e s c r i b e d as      merry although             they were             not     drunk.

                 They were           polite       and    talked         to me    on a n u m b e r        of    occasions,            in

* between        serving         customers              from      the     conversation               I had w i t h       them         I

 ascertained             t hat      they       had      travelled           on     the      train     from Liverpool                  to

 Sheffield with                other         Liverpool            supporters              and although            none       of    them

 had tickets             for     the      semi       fina l       match       it was         their        intention          to go         to

 the H i l l s b o r o u g h        ground and              gain     entry         into      the     stadium.

 They      even asked            me      to go       to     the     ground with              them and         I said         t ha t       t he y

 would      not     get     in w i t h o u t         a ticket,            but     although           I cannot       exactly

 remember          how    they        said        that      they were            going       to     get    in t h e y    said         it

 would      be     e a s y as       they       had      done      it b e f o r e       and      there      were    other

 Liverpool          f ans      who       had      come      down with            them,       without        tickets          who were

 going      to get        in the          g r o u n d as well.

 Also      in the        pub at          the      s am e    t ime    there        were       a small        group       of

 Nottingham Forest                    f ans       but      they did         not     have any          conversation with

 myself       or    the L i v e r p o o l          f ans      and    these         people         left     the    pub at a b o u t

 •1.30pm      (1330).

 At about          1.45pm        (1345)           I wa s      asked       by the          Liverpool         supporters             to

 call     them a         taxi       to    take       t h e m to      the      Hillsborough                football       stadium,

 the     first      two     occasions              I tried          to    p h one      for a taxi           the    line was

 engaged.           I eventually                  got      t h r o u g h at      about       1.55pm        <1355)       and       booked

 a   taxi    for     them with a                  company         c a l l e d C i t y Car s ,         1 thi n k ,       t his      taxi

 eventually          arrived             at a b o u t 2 . 3 0        (1430)         to 2 . 4 5       <1445)       and    t ook        the

 Liverpool          supporters               to    the      ground.

 During      their        s t a y at         the     pub      I am u n a b l e         to    sa y    exactly       how m u c h            they

 consumed          in the w a y           of a l c o h o l i c       d r i n k s , but          they were         drinking

 s t e a d i l y all      the       t im e     they were            ther e.

 The     group      of L i v e r p o o l          supporters             we re a g e d       in t h e i r    mid    t w e n t ie s ,

 they     t o l d me      about          not      having       tickets           was      not     true.

 I left      the     pub at a b o u t              4.30pm         (1630)         t ha t     da y a n d m a d e     my way          home.

                 On S a t u r d a y           15   A p ril    1989     (150489)         I       planned          to   play     g o lf        at       Concord

                 G olf       Course           in   S h e ffie ld ,     and      had   arranged              to    meet      s ome    frien d s               there

                 at     1 pm ( 1 3 0 0 ) .          The      course     is      about       4    m iles      from      my     home,          and       my

                 route            there       takes     me    past     H illsb o ro u g h         F o o tb all        Ground.            Knowing              that

                 the        FA C up S e m i         F in al    was     being       played         at    the       ground       on    that             day     I

                 set        off     e arly,        in   case     of    tra ffic       congestion                 in   the     v ic in ity ,             leaving

                 home        about        11.45am         (1145).           I   drove       alone       in       my   car,     and       was

                 surprised               to    fin d    very     lit t le       a c tiv ity       near       the      ground        as       I       passed.

                 My     route          was      from    M alin      B ridge      along          Dykes       Lane      down     Wynyard                Road,
                              !                                                                         .


                 le ft       towards           Lappings        Lane     tra ffic        lig h ts ,          up H a l i f a x    Road             -    passing

                 along            Leppings         Lane,      and     past      the   ground           entrance          at    that          point.               I
                                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                                        S43

passed        there       about       11.50am       (1150)       and    saw    very      few football

supporters           and     traffic         was    light.        I saw       t h at    th e P o l i c e    had    blocked

off    the     side       roads       to    protect       r e s i d e n t s ’ parking,         and     I saw,      I think,

about    50       policemen           in that       area.

Having        time       in h a n d    before       meeting       my    friends,         I s t o p p e d at       the

"Sicey"        on S i c e y A v e n u e       to    pass    time       until     I met        them.        I went       into

the    pub a n d o r d e r e d a h a l f            pint    of    lager,       and      sat    down       in the       bar

1o u n g .

I sat        just    to    the    right       of    the m a i n    entrance.             There       were

approximately              fifteen          people       in the    pub.        The      r o o m h as      ’bays*       around

its    circumference              and       I sat at       the    end    of    one      of    the    'bays*       nearest

the    entrance,           with       my   back     to    the    next    ’b a y ’ .      Sitting          b e hi n d me were

three    men,        who     were      already          there    when    I arrived.

After    a few m in u te s             I became          aware    of    their       conversation.                I cannot

now    remember           the    exact       words,       but    I gathered            first    of all        that      they

were    football           supporters,             intending       to go       to      the    semi-final          at

Hillsborough.

As    I went        to    sit    down       I had       noticed    that       these      three       men were          as

followss~

•1.    Hid     thirties,          black       or    dark    brown       hai r , cut          slightly       longer          than

normal,        w i t h a dark          moustache.           He w a s w e a r i n g       black       leather       hip

length        coat,       dark    trousers.

2.     Mid     t w e n t i e s , l i ght      sandy       hai r , cut     very         short,       but    not a       crew

cut,    clean shaven,                 wearing       red    sweater,       crew         neck    and a       pink    shirt

collar        worn       outside,          light    grey    trousers.

3.     Mid     twenties,          hair       li g h t    brown and       cut     ear     l e n gth,       wearing a

tweed        sports       jacket.           I cannot       describe       t h i s m a n a® w e l l          as    the

others       as     he    sat    farthest          away    f r o m me.

As    I listened           to    this       conversation,          I heard          this      older man          (n o . 1)

talking        to    the     others,        saying        that    they    should         not w o r r y a b o u t        not
                                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                                     S45

having        tickets.              The y w oul d meet                up w i t h       "the       others"          outside

Leppings           Lane       entrance.              They would             organise             as m a n y    people          as

possible           to    cause w h a t ev e r           trouble            they       could.          If e n o u g h       trouble        was

caused        the       gates       would      have        to    be    opened.              I gathered             that     this       h ad

happened           before,          and   this man              seemed          confident           that      this       action        could

be    f or c e d .

The    sandy         haired man           (no.        2)    asked          how    the       "others"          would        know      to

meet     up at          the    right      time.         (No.         1) T h e     other man             said       if t h e y       got

there       for      about       2 . 1 5 pm    (1415)           he    knew most             of    the     other         lads     and      they

could       quickly           be g o t    organised.                  He    said       " W e ’ve     got      to g e t      as      close

to    the     turnstiles             as   possible."                  He    s a i d w h e n th e          gate was          opened,

they would              force       their      way      through            to    "the       back     of    the      go al " .

At    this     point          one    of   the        three men             noticed          I was       listening,             and     they

g l a r e d at me          in a n      u n f r i e n d l y way. I h u r r i e d l y               drank            the    remainder

of m y      drink        and     left     the        pub.       The         time w o u l d         then    be a b o u t        12.H Opm

(1 2 2 0 ).

I was       in the         pub      for a b o u t       te n to       fifteen minutes.                         I was      able       to    see

t h e s e m e n as         I walked           from      the bar             to m y      seat,        and   as I s t o o d           up to

leave.

I know        that       these       men were           Liverpool               supporters           because            nos.     2 and 3

had Liverpool                 accents.             N o . 1 h a d a n E a s t M i d l a n d s / N o t t i n g h a m s h i re

they were            well      aware      that        this was             their       team's        end      of    the     ground.

I did       not      place      too m uc h           importance             on    the       conversation                I had       heard,

and went           to    play       g o lf.        On my way           home       in the          car     I heard         on the

radio       t ha t      there       had   been an           incident             at    the       semi-final,             and

thereafter              the    conversation                became          more       significant             to me.           The

course        of     the      public      hearings              of    the       enquiry          currently          being

I must        say       that     I gained           the     impression                that       the P o l i c e        were     being

             unfairly          blamed    for    this     course    of    events.

             On    the       day after    the H i l l s b o r o u g h   tragedy,   I discussed with a golfing

             friend,                              what    I ha d    heard    in the    pu b on   the       p r e v i o u s day.

             He    suggested       I t e ll     the P o l i c e   about    it,   but   I did   not    do     so

             immediately.

One     of    the      two m e n        then     said     to me          " D o n ’t w o r r y a b o u t       that,         we     know

               During           the m o r n i n g    of S a t u r d a y    15 A p r i l      1989      (150489) I was            working

               at     the a b o v e      d e v e 1o p m e n t   unti1 approximately                    1 2 . 3 0 p m (1230) w h e n        I

                left a n d v i s i t e d         the W h i t e H a r t       public         house      which      is      situate       at the

                junction           of O r c h a r d S t r e e t    and     the    main       road      l e a d i n g to

               Stocksbridge.                 I had a r r a ng e d         to m e e t    a friend          called                             at

                the       public      house.                    is a j o i n e r       and     he    is s o m e t i m e s    employed          by

               my     company         on a s u b - c o n t r a c t   basis        as    and when work             of      that   nature         is

                required.

               When        I arrived        at      the   public      house       I saw        the     landlord,                    I

                                    standing         at   the     entrance        and       he w a s    obviously           vetting

                people          before     he a l l o w e d     them access            to    the     premises.

                I was      aware       that      a semi-final             football          m a t c h was    being        played    later

                                                                                                                                 S47

that    day at           the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m a n d            the W h i t e      Hart      public          house

is    positioned            on     the m a i n       road       leading           from Sheffield,               over       the

Pennines,           to M a n c h e s t e r        and     the N o r t h W e s t          of the      country.              This

public     house           is     regularly          frequented,              on m a t c h      days,      by f o o t b a l l

supporters.

I went     outside              the     public       house        and      I would        estimate         that       about        SO

persons were              within          the     bar a r e a ,        a mixture          of    football         supporters

and    local        p e ople.

I easily as cer t ai ne d                    that    the       football           supporters         were       from Liverpool

as    I could        tell         by    their       accents.

These     people were                  behaving          in a n      orderly manner              and      there       was     no

trouble.

The    premises           were         very     full      and     I was       subsequently             joined         by my

f r i e n d ______________.                We     ha d a      couple         of   drinks       and   due        to   the

premises        being           b u s y we      decided         to     visit       th e P h e a s a n t    public          house

which    is s i t u a t e d            on S t a t i o n R o a d        at O u g h t i b r i d g e    and    is a s h o r t

distance        away        from        the W h i t e         Hart     public       house.          The    r e a s o n we        c h ose

that    public           house         is due       to    it b e i n g       located         on a q u i e t      side       r o a d off

th e m a i n    h i g h w a y a n d we a s s u m e d              that       football          supporters            may    not     have

found    it.

                         and myself             arrived         at     the    Pheasant          public      house          at a b o u t

1.15pm     (1315)           a n d we         discovered           that       these       premises         were       also     being

used    by L i v e r p o o l           football          supporters.               The    premises         consist          of 2

rooms,     the       loung         bar w h i c h         is    comfortably             furnished and             the       public

bar w h i c h       is    used         for    games       etc.         Outside         the     premises         there       is a

terraced/paved                  area where           benches           and    seats       are    used      by    customers

wishing        to    remain            outside.           The     terraced          a r e a wa s     busy and          I quickly

ascertained              t h at   a     l a rge     number        of    the       people       outside      were       Liverpool

football        supporters.

We    entered        the        premises          via     the     front       d oo r     and    turned      r i gh t       into    the

lounge       bar w h i c h w a s          very       busy and           contained a               l a rge    number        of    people

which       included         the     regular           customers           and Liverpool                 football

supporters.             The       supporters               were    in the m a i n well                  behaved      although

several        were     rather          noisey         but       nothing         unpleasant.                I believe           that    I

overheard         the    landlord              _______ f‘ s a y         t ha t    several          of    the     supporters            had

booked a table               at     the    premises              for a m e a l         and    that       this     was      a    regular

conversation with 2 Liverpool                                supporters               who    were       standing        at      the    bar

next    to     us.                  [a n d m y s e l f       were       wearing         our w o r k i n g        clothes         and    it

would       be o b v i o u s      that     we       ha d    been working               on a b u i l d i n g       site         as we

were    covered         in     cement          dust        and    other       debris.             They asked          us w h a t       our

occupations            were       and     it s o o n        became       apparent            that       they were          a ls o

employed         in the        building             industry.            The      m e n are        described          as       followss-

1.     M a l e , white         about       30-35 y e a r s , medium                    build,       5*7      tall,      li ght

       brown      hair,        collar          1 ength.

2.     As    above.

I cannot         describe           them       further           other     than        they       both      spoke    with

Liverpool         accents.

One    of    them      stated        t ha t     he w a s         a joiner         and       the    other       being       a mason/

p a v ier.

At    about     2.00pm         (1400)          my    e m p l o y e r , Peter           Marjoram,            a r r i v e d at     the

premises        and     he     joined          us    in the        lounge         bar.

We    continued         to     talk       to    the 2 L i v e r p o o l           supporters             about      the        building

industry        and     I believe              the     conversation               related          to    payments          of

c r a f t s m e n as    it     is    part       of a n y         duty    to w o r k         our    payments         for        sub­

contractors.

At about        2.30pm         (1430)          I asked           the    men      if    it was       about        time      they

were    leaving         as     it w a s a           considerable              distance            between Oughtibridge

and    the     football           ground and               I would       estimate            the    d i s t a n c e at a b o u t
                                                                                                                                         PAGE       4
                                                                                                                                         S47

            two     and a half          miles.

            We    told    the m e n       that       they would             have     to    park       their      car     in the

            v i c i n i t y of    the T e x a c o         Filling Station,                 near       to M i d d l e w o o d H o s p i t a l ,

            and walk        to    the     ground          from    there.           One     of    the m e n       said words            to     the

            effect       that     they were            confident            of    getting        into      the    ground          because

            the     gate w o u l d      be    open        or o p e n e d ,       I am     not    sure      w h i c h w o r d was         used.

             ( O p e n or o p e n e d )      Th e   2 men        did    not a p p e a r         to me      to    be     potential

             trouble makers             and     they appeared                to    be     decent        p e o p le .     I d i d n ’t hear

             them    s a y t h at      they     had       tickets       for       the m a t c h ,      nor      did     I see      any

             t ickets.

            The     manner       in w h i c h       one       of t h e m s a i d     that       the     gate w o u l d       be    open       or

            opened       di d    not    imply        to       me that t h e y        were       going      to a t t e m p t       to   force

             entry     into      the    ground.

            The     2 m e n w i t h w h o m we              ha d b e e n s p e a k i n g    left       the      public       house       at

            about      2.40pm       (1440)          and       at t h at t i m e      the    public         house       was    almost

             vacated      by all        the L i v e r p o o l       supporters             leaving         only        the   locals         in side.

            As    far as        I can     re c a l l      there was          no    trouble        at     the     premises.

There      were        groups      of        f a ns    walking           up a nd      down Leppings                 Lane      asking

others       for       tickets,             t h is    went      on      from   the       t i me    of    my      arrival         at    the

point      until        j us t    before             kick-off.            I saw       several           instances           of

spectators             purchasing              tickets          I think          25      was      the a s k i n g       price.




The    mood       of     th e    f an s      arriving           wa s     generally          happy/boisterous/singing,

obviously          looking             forward          to the          match.        X did        not      see a n y       bad

behaviour          as     such         but     as     time      got      nearer       kick-off             there       were      still

many      asking         for      tickets.



From      about        2pm       I was        with PS           1561     Reynolds          standing            in f r o n t      of a

private        garage            area       almost         opposite        Eskdale          Road         ju st      after        I think

Bickerton          Road.           This        was      a result          of    a    complaint             from an          elderly

couple       who       were       washing            t h eir      car    in th e      garage          area       regarding            fans

using       the    garages             as     a to ilet.



From       that    point          we    c o u l d see           down Leppings              Lane       to      the    b o t t o m at      the

roundabout, at P e n i s t o n e                     Road,        during       that       t i me    there        was    a    continuous

stream       of    f an s        arriving,             causing          problems          for      traffic          on t h e      road,

one       fan was        spoken         to      by P S R e y n o l d s         for       deliberately walking                      on    the

road       in f r o n t       of a bus.                Th e m o o d      was     ge n er al l y good             natured and

enthusiastic.                    There        seemed         to    be    no    let       up of      numbers          arriving and

about       2.50pm         1 made            the      p oint      to P S R e y n o l d s          that     there was             no w a y

could       they        get      into        the      ground       for     kick-off,            and      for     them       to    do so

the       kick-off         would        have          to   be     delayed.           About         3pm     1 heard          on P S

Reynold's              r a dio    that        t h e r e was        a    large       c r o w d at        the    turnstiles             and

apparent           trouble         there.



As    a    result         together            with PS Reynolds,                     PC    B r a d l e y a n d PC S e v e r n we
went    directly             to    to       the     turnstile            a r e a,     large        numbers          of    persons

the r e ,    I saw       some          climbing            up o ve r       the w a l l        into       the       ground and many

of    them     running            up a n d        climbing          o ve r      the     turnstiles             themselves.                  The

time    then w o ul d             be a b o u t        3.05pm        just        after        the m a i n       b ulk      of    them        had

been    let       in t h r o u g h          the     gate w h i c h        had        been     opened.              Not    knowing           at

that    t i me     t hat         the     gate       had     been opened               I prevented              several          youths

from    climbing             over        the      turnstiles             and moved            others          to    the    other          side

of    the    gates        in f r o n t         of     the    turnstiles.                   Remained           there       and       several

'fans*       leaving             the     ground         then     i n f o r m e d me          that      there        were       serious

problems          in s i d e ,     one       described           it      it as        being        worse       than       the       Heysel

disaster.




Many    people          leaving             the     ground       now a n d           the     general          attitude          n o w was

of a n g e r      and    sheer           hatred         towards          the P o l i c e ,         many       threatening

officers          and     calling            us m u r d e r e r s ,        the m a i n        were       very       hostile          towards

us,    so m u c h       so       t hat      I was af ra id            for       my    own and          other        officers

safety.           Many       of    them were               in tears.




About       3.20pm        I was          in d e s p e r a t e       need        of    th e    toilet,          so    I went          into

the    ground and                walked        down        the   side        of      the     North Stand             to    the       toilet,

there were             lar g e     numbers            leaving         the       stand        by    them,       while       in       the

toilet       ( alone)            I was       subjected           to a b a r r a g e           of       threats and             abuse        from

about       3 0 m en ,       3    or 4       t ol d     them     to      leave        me     alone       as    it w a s        not m y

fault,       if t h e y          had     not      d o ne    th is     I feel          sure        that    I would          have       been

assaulted.              On       leaving          the      toilet        I walked            around       the       back       of    t he

West    Stand          trying          to    find a way             on     to     the      playing        a r e a,       but    not

knowing        the      ground           could        not    get      on.         Unable          to    get    on to       the       pitch        I

then    had       to    return           outside           the   ground           and      join        other       officers          the re .

Ambulances             and       fire       tenders were              arriving             now and a steady                    continuous

stream       of    people           leaving           the    ground and               the a b u s e       &nd       threats

Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when shouted

at by myself, carried on regardless.                 At this time my attention was drawn to

back of turnstiles            for North Stand where          Police     Constables        from my serial

had come through the turnstiles.                 Entrance gates       'A' were shaking violently.

Fans    coming      through turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting                         THEY RE GETTING

KILLED OUT THERE,            THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS,'                   and screaming for

gate 'A' to be opened.

Gate    'A' opened and crowd surged               forward    through       the    gate.     The     gate was

closed again only seconds later.

Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool                        fans coming through suddenly a

crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are closed.                               Only people now

attempting       to    get     in   are   very    drunk    Liverpool       fans.    Turnstiles        closed

 scuffling breaking out between Liverpool fans and in one occasion a drunken

 Liverpool fan lashed out at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle. Suddenly

 Special Inspector beckons wildly at me.                     I ran to gates         'B' where I saw an

 obviously dead boy being put in an ambulance,                       passed a near naked dead man

 at    gate   'B'     and    into   the   area   between     gate    'B'    and    the     tunnel    for   the

 terraces.       In this area approximately 10 dead people were strewn about.

 I    checked    these      to ensure     they   were     dead   then   assisted      with    the    injured

 people some of who were also lying in this area.                           I then,       after seeing the

 arrival of ambulance crews, ran through the tunnel to the terraces where I

 was met by a wall of Liverpool fans, looking over them I could see the pitch

 had been invaded,           people around me in the tunnel began moaning, I assisted

 to    escort       these    people   out   of    the     tunnel    where    if    they     were     injured,

 directed ambulance crews to them.

 Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair haired boy

 in a Liverpool shirt and light trousers in the lane running adjacent to the

River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.

Attention      called   for    Leppings    Lane     terraces      where    Liverpool   fans   were

attacking another Liverpool fan who they say was picking up belongings from

the terraces and putting them in his               pocket.

Called by another officer to go to                 Leppings      Lane.On   the way assist to

remove    bodies   from back of terrace            tunnel      to lane running adjacent to the

River    Don   then   form    cordon helping       fans   to     leave ground, stream of urine

running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans leaving ground violent and asking if the match is off.

Ambulances convey bodies away.

Liverpool fans leave, then instructed to go to North Stand for de-brief.

Throughout these events I felt nothing, I just helped where I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what to do but help with the dead and

injured.

I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous occasions and

usually have policed the same turnstiles without any trouble.

there       was      a    lot    of    p'ushing       towards          the     turnstiles.                 None       of    the

A s .the      time        got    towards          3,00pm       there      were       stili       hundreds             of

It   became          increasingly                impossible        to     direct       t h ese        people          and    from

problems,,               I tried       on    several       occasions            to    get       into       tne    crowd          to

split       it      up    but    it    became       increasingly               impossible             to    penetrate             it,,

Among       the      crowd       ju st      a few     feet      from      me    1 saw       one       youth       selling

within          seconds             I neard        someone         offer        hi m      35.00 and           he m o v e d         on.




At a b o u t         or    just       after        3.00pm,         I saw        t h a t :?A*     Gate        t hat      gives          access

to    the       North          Stand       and     either        58 3 or        *C * G a t e s       were     opened          and       this

instantly             eased          the    density         of     the       crowd       outside.            T hese         gates       f r o m my

recollection were                         only     open     for       a f ew       seconds.            Supporters             were        stiIi

corning         to    the       ground          after      the     n or m a l      k i c k off       time     and       there- was

still       a    crowd          o'utsids.            The    supporters                that     wer e      outside           the    ground

pr ior      to       the       gates       b e ing     opened were              in a v e r y a g i t a t e d            mood and were

clearly          very a n n o y e d             that    they       could        not      get    in on        time.




Some     time a f t e r              3.00pm        1 received            a    ra dio      message          t h at      requested              ail

officers             to    attend          in si d e    tne      ground         at     the     Leppings           Lane       end.         X

then     ran         through          'A'       Gate    and      into        the      North Stand            and       on    to    the

pitch.           When          I first          entered         the     inside         playing         area       of    the       ground        I

saw a mass                of    people          including          Police          Officers          on    the      t rack        behind

the    Lappings                Lane       end    goalmouth            and     actually          on     the    pitch.              My    fi r s t

impression                was       that    there       had      been        s o me    sort     of     pitch        invasion.

There       were          many       supporters            climbing           o ve r     the    m e ta l     fencing.              As     I got

to    the       front          of    the    terracing            it     became         obvious         that       a serious

incident,            was       taking       p lace      and      1 saw one m a n on the p i t c h wh o was

being       treated             by    the       Sit J o h n s    Ambulance             Service,,           Th e     man      appeared           to

be    dead.           Supporters                continued          to    dime          over     the       fencing,           many       of

whom     w ere        in a highly                distressed             c o ndi tion and             some     collapsed.                  I

could       see       that          the    crowd       in the         centre          pen w e r e      being        crushed            and

pushed          right          up    to    the     fen c i n g .        People         were     climbing            o ver     each        o t her

to    g e t 'out          of    the       pen.       The    scene        rapidly          became          chaotic           with       w ha t

seemed          to    be       hundreds          of P o l i c e       and     supporters             on    the      pitch.             I was

continuously                   giving       assistance             to    those         wh o    had     got    over          the    f en c e

              saw    that      one       of     those      bodies         was     a man      who      I now       know     to    be a C a r A

             Brown.          I checked              hum    for      s i gn s    of    life      but     he w a s     dead.        With       tne

              help    of     some        of     the    Liverpool            supporters           I carried           the    body       on a

             wooden         placard           and     t o ok   him     to      trie g y m n a s i u m      where     I stayed          until

              fat h e r .      T he      body       showed       no a p p a r e n t      signs        of    violence        other       than a

              mark    on     this        head,,         1 handed          the     body     ove r      to    the    mortuary        staff          at

              My    feelings          at      the     time     of     the      incident         in si d e    the     ground       were       of

              disbelief           and      a thought           that       such a thing             couldn't          happen       at

             climbing           from       the       stand- into          tne       terrace,,

             The    fans        behind          us w e r e       fairly       quiet          and    seemed         to    sense        that

             s a me t h m   g    was       am i s s .

             A   scuffle         began          in the       area       below         the     Police       co n t r o l        box    a n d as        we

             moved       forward           it a p p e a r e d      so     did       the      crowd       and a      cry        rose,       so we w e r e

             ordered         back         by one       Senior          Officer         in f r o n t       of    the      line.

             Standing           on    the       line,       the    ground           appeared         to    be a b s o l u t e l y          packed          and

             I felt         that      the       c he e r    from       the    E>pion K o p w o u l d            have         brought        the       fans

             out    of    the        Liverpool             terraces          and      onto     the       pitch.

             We w e r e      then         directed          to    leave       the      ground        and       deal      with        crowds

             leaving         Ihe      ground.

             there       was     no       trouble          with    cro w d s        after      the       match      at       the     junction          of

             fielding           Road      and       Penistone           Hoad,        although            I received            a number           of

             questions           along         the     line       of w h e r e       wa s     the    nearest            pub/off        lice n c e .

             I remained             in s i d e    the    g ro u nd ,         on    the     pitch,         until    most       of    the

             supporters             ha d   left        the    gr o u n d ,         I was       completely          stunned          by all       that

             ha d     happened         and       could       not     initially             understand            how     it    could      have

             happened,              1 was        not    in the         ground           when    the       incident        began,       but      it    is

             my     opinion         that,        being       present          outside          the L e p p i n g s      Lane       entrances,

             it wa s        extremely            lucky       that      no     serious          injuries          ha d   occurred          outside.

The     Duild       up of        fans       in the L e p p i n g s          Lane       area      obviously             increased            as

During        the    afternoon             1 was      asked          by    possibly               7 or S fans              if      I knew

the    location           of     any    ticket        touts          for       them      to       buy    tickets.               I wa s       not

aware        of a n y     i rt the      area.         This       seemed             strange         in so m u c h             as    tne

previous         year       when       tne    same       two     teams          p l a y e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h              I saw

the    answer        wa s      no.

As    the     kick      off      approached           I was          not       near      the       Leppings             Lane

Once     tne     fans       had      cleared         in L a p p i n g s         Lane         1 began making                   my way         to

Uniform           O fficers           were        on     duty        in    that           area,        o fficers          were           at       each

tu rn stile             entrance            gate,        and       officers               were     on    duty        at     a barricade                      on

the       driveway             to    the     rear        of    the        South           stand.

Further            o fficers          were        on     duty        as        a    coach     reception              party              in    the       area

im m ediately              in       front        of     the     tu rn stiles.                 It       appeared            at       that          time       the

number            of     uniform ed             P olice        officers              was     in    the        region           of       40.

At       this      tim e       the     crowd          which         had        started        to       gather        was        mixed             with

many        fam ilies           being           present.            The        behaviour           of        the    fans        was          good

humour e d .

As       the      afternoon            wore        on    the        crowd           steadily           b u ilt      up     and          the       mood

became            fa irly       h o stile,            because             numerous           fans        were       m illing             around

w ithout           tickets,            at       th is        time    I     lost           count    of        the    number              of        peole       who

approached                me a n d         asked        whether            I       had     either        tickets           to       sell           or    just

spare.

 I       personally             saw    a    number            of    men            selling        tickets          w ith        large             groups          of

 people           stood        around            them,        who    were            obviously           trying           to     buy          tickets

 for       the         game.        Due     to        this     the        area        around           the    corner            shop          which          is

 d irectly              adjacent           to     the        football               stadium        became           particu larly

 congested.

 The       vehicular                tra ffic          along        Leppings               Lane     its e lf         appeared                 to       grind       to

 a       h alt,        w ith    the    odd        vehicle            passing,              although           it     should              be       said       that

 numerous               coaches        and        Public           Service            Vehicles           came        along              that          road

 under          P olice         m otorcycle              escort           to        the    reception               area.

 The       uniform ed               o fficers           in    that        location           attended               those           vehicles             and       a

 search            of     persons           leaving           the        vehicles           was        undertaken.

     I   recall         seeing        two        coaches            arrive           at    the     s a me      tim e,          two       officers

 approached                one       vehicle            and    the        remainder               of    the        serial           6    or       8

     o fficers          approached               the     other           vehicle.             I recall              thinking                 that       there

 was        less        o fficers           in    that        area,            than       there        had     been        in       previous

     years.            However         I must           say        that        I    had    several           arrests            take          place

                                                                                                                               _/7Q

and      believe           that        this       ma y       have        drawn         strength           away       from         the        reception

party.

At      this     tim e       there          were        no    problems               and     no     real        cause        for          concern

involving             public           disorder.

It      should        be        pointed           out    that           Mounted         o fficers          were        operating                   in     the

Leppings             Lane        tu rn stile            and        paddock           area,        the     number           of      officers

being          two        sergeants,              one    of        those        being        a    South         Yorkshire                 O fficer,

four      Police            Constables,                 two        of    those         being        male        M erseyside                officers.

The      Merseyside                  officers           operating               in     the       area     directly                in      front         of

the      Paddock            and       tu rn stiles.

At      around            1.15pm        (1315)          together               w ith    the       other         members              of      the

Pickpocket                 Team,       I    walked           along           Leppings            Lane,      due       to     reports               of

pickpockets                 operating                 further           along        the      road,        at     this       time            numerous

people          ju st       hanging           about,           sat       on      the     pavement            leaning            against             the

w alls,         sat        on    the        parapet           of     the       bridges,           many       of      these            people        were

I       even    recall           seeing           a    very        attractive                young        lady       w ith        two        friends,

drinking             from        cans        of       lager.            In     the      space       of     approxim ately                     half           an

At       around           1.30pm        (1330),               together w ith                  D e t . Con.        Hallam          and         remainder

 of      team,        I    walked           down        Leppings             Lane       in    the       directio n              of     the

 roundabout,                the        observations                  went         as     far      as th e         c h i p shop            situated                at

Due    to     the        density           of    the          crowd,        observations                   regarding            pickpockets

W hilst       at       th is       location           I       recall        moving            numerous           bottles             of    both

alcohol           and        soft     drinks          which           had        been    discarded               underneath                the

standing              about,         these        people             obviously            had        no    tickets.              This           was

At     2.20pm           (1420)        or        thereabouts               the      crowd            became       very         dense,            so    mu c h

 entrances              to     the    West        stand.

W hilst          at     that        location              repeatedly              asked        for        spare        tickets             or    tickets

 for    sale,           those        persons              obviously              now     getting           very     w orried               about

 enquired              about        tickets,              moved        into       the     paddock           area        and      towards

 tu rn stiles            which         by       now       had       large        queues.

we    had       now     taken          up,     which              was     d irectly           adjacent            to     the     roadway                  and

is    on    a    lip        which        affords              a    view        which        is    slig h tly           elevated              and          looks

it     seemed          that        from       the      area             near    to     the       shop       some        considerable

distance             away         right       up      to      the        ground        was       to tally          blocked            by     people

moving          towards            the       ground.               By     this        tim e      vehicular              tra ffic           had         ceased

paddock              area     which          was      now t o t a l l y           fu ll        w ith        people        and      s t ill           more

walking              towards           the     ground,              I    saw    groups           of        young       men     pushing                into

the     crowd,           the       m ajority             of       these        being        the        worse       for        drink,            I    saw

several              carrying           and      drinking                from        large        2    litre       bottles            of        both

 lager       and       beer.

At     this          tim e    I     noted        that           the      Police         horses             were    moving          amongst                 the

My     im pression                of    the      situation                was        that        the       crowd       wa s    becoming

 desperate             due        to    having             no     tickets         and       w ith          no   hope      of     getting

 tickets,             also        the      fact       that          the        ones     who       had       tickets           would          miss          the

 start          of    the     g a me       due      to      large         amount          of      people          trying         to     gain              entry

 I cannot             recall           the     tim e,             but    w hilst        stood          at       this     location               a     Police

id en tity                  unknown.

PC B u x t o n                  the    driver           of     the       vehicle,              alighted          and        stood      on      the        body

of           the      vehicle               and    w hilst          doing          so    he     was       using       the     vehicles              PA

    the       front             being        crushed'.               I       noted        several           large         groups       of      young

    Liverpool                   fans,        who    were         pushing             into       the        crowd      and     making           some

    headway                towards           the    tu rn stiles,                   these       fans        pushing          others           out        of   the


    way.

    I        spoke         to    several           fans        saying              ’ Don’ t     go        forward,          stay       back’ .            Many

    ignored                th is.

    At        this         point        I    saw     several                 people       clim bing             on    the    fences           around          the

    paddock                area.            Once     clim bing                into       that       position              those    people           were        then

    helping                others           up     onto       the        fence        tops.           I    then       saw    one       fan     climb          over

    into             the     actual          ground,            he     was         then     follow ed            by       others,        I    then        saw

    Inspector                   Bennett            appear         on         the    roof       of     the       tu rn stile        area.             I    saw

    the          o fficer             assist        several              fans       to    clim b          into       the    ground           area.

        It    was       obvious             at     this       stage           that       many        people          were    being           crushed           at

    the          tu rn stiles,                people          were           not    moving           through          the    actual           tu rn stiles

    and          I    recall           thinking              that        I    couldn’ t          see       any       Police       helm ets           at       the

        tu rn stiles.

        Both         PC B u x t o n          and    the        unknown             uniform           Inspector             were     now        using          the

        PA    system,             repeatedly                 asking           the       crowd        to    stop       pushing          and      that          there

        was      people           being           crushed.               I    recall           one    of       the    officers               stating          that

    people          to            gain        entry           to    the     ground.          S till          no    one       taking            any       notice

    I       observed               the        Police           Mounted            Inspector,           obviously                 shouting               at     the

    crowd,           I       noted            that        his       horse         seemed     to    be        going          under         due       to        the

             I am       presently             stationed             in D o n c a s t e r        Town    Sub Division,              Doncaster

             Division,             as    a uniform             patrol          sergeant.

             Doncaster             Police          Station          for    my       duties       at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,     I knew       from

             correspondence                    received          same      days       earlier          that     I was       in    charge       of a

             serial          of    eight          officers          arm    that       our       duties     were       to    be at       each     end

             of V e r e       Road       and Fielding                Road       at    tneir       junctions           wiih Leppings              Lane

             anyone          except          residents.

             We       were    transported                to H i l l s b o r o u g h        by    bus    and were           briefed       in the

             North Stand                at     10 am       that      morning.

             Shortly          after          11 am,        the      e i g ht    officers          in m y       se r ia l    in f o u r    pairs,

             took       up d u t y       at       their     points,.            Metal       barriers           were    placed       across         the

             road       junctions              immediately             the      officers          got     to    their       points.

             The       Inspector             in    charge        of my         serial       was     Inspector          Belwood.           I saw

             h i m at        the    briefing             and     several            times       throughout         the      day.

             I wa s      issued with                a    radio       at   the        briefing,          the     officers          on my       se r ia l

             were       not.        I nad          therefore           no w a y       of    contacting            them      other       than     by a

             personal             visit       to    their        place         of    duty.        This     could       involve          a walk        of

             perhaps          three          h u n d r e d y a rd s ,     from        one       point     to    the    next.

Offitsrs          working          at    the      Leppings             Lane        end were            involved          with

L iver p o o 3. s u p p o r 1 8 r s ,

I visited           alternately               all     four        p a irs        of     officers            in my      serial,,

At    the     junction            of V e r e      Road        ana Peru stone                  Road         North,      there       is a

fish ana          chip       shop       on one        side        and       an     off       licence         on    the      other       side,,

From    q u i te      early        in the         day,        l arge        queues           had    formed        at     both      shops,,

A    large      percentage              of    supporters               of    doth          c lubs      were       drinking         as    they

were    walking             along       and     carrying            cans         of     beer,,         I saw       one      youth

drinking          from       a seven           pint      party         can       of     beer..

It was        also     apparent              that     both        sets       of       supporters             were      intermingling

at    both      sides        of    the       g r o u nd ,     mainly         I think             by a c c i d e n t      having         got

Throughout            the     day,       I di d       not      see      any        problems            involving            rival       sets

of    supporters,,                The    mood       of      the     fans         going        to    the      match       wa s     good,       and

I saw       no a n i m o s i t y        from      them        towards            either          the       Police      or    fellow

supporters,

I was       approached             by    several            persons          from about                2    pm a s k i n g       where

there       were      some        public        toilets,,              I did          not     know         of a n y    and       told    them

that     as     far    as     1 Knew          the     only        'toilets w e r e               inside        the     ground,,          All

said     that       it wa s        too       early       to    go      in,       obviously             because         it w o u l d      s t op

them     f r om     drinking.                I was       also       approached                by    several           obvious

At   about        2,, 2 0    pm    I joined           two      officers               PC     2526 Ayres            and      PC    2042    Drury

of    the       turnstiles,                 I could           see        that     there          were       Police       officers            there

with       the        crowd,         I could           see        the     mounted           officers           above        tne    heads         of

the       crowd.            I did        not    appreciate                the     seriousness                of    this      crowding

something              was     not       done      about          it,     there        would        be a n o t h e r        Heysel

a    call     for    an       ambulance           because           someone          was     seriously                injured          but       was

still        unaware          of    the    situation               ins ice      the       gr o und.

Shortly        after          the    incident           developed,              a few        people           started            leaving

had     no     idea       of tne d i s a s t e r         which        ha d      occurred            but       were       aware         that

It w a s      only       then,       perhaps           ED m i n u t e s        after,        that        1 realised               the

seriousness              of    what       ha d    occurred.              it was           too     late        by      then       to    be     of

any    help        inside          the    ground        and        in any       case,        a    lot       of     people         were

leaving        the       ground          requiring           supervision.                   Some       of     them?       mainly

teenagers           who       had    been        drinking          were        snouting           and       swearing             at    the

             when       the      crowd       began      to    leave        entnass,         Even more           people       were      shouting

             accusations               at    the    Police         although        I wouia             say    that    they were          only a

residents.               This       did        not       deter          them       as       m any    stated                 th a t     it    was        early

about       2    hours.

By    1.30pm          (1330)          there          were       hoards              of    people             on L e p p i n g s       Lane       and

outside          the       tu rn stiles              on       Leppings              Lane.

At    about          2.10pm       (1410)             I    remarked                 to    PC    Patterson              th a t       the    train

carrying             Liverpool             supporters                was           just       pulling           into     W ad s 1 e y         Bridge

couldn’ t            possibly          keep          to       the    pavements.

stewards             was       poor    and       I       would       have           expected             better         from        th e m     towards

us.       If     th e y        treat       us    as       they       did           what       would          they     treat         the       fa n s

people          stating          that       they          had       tickets              for       seats        in    the      North          stand      and

I    returned                 back        to    the       b arrier             at        the    top        of    Fielding              Road        w ith

informed          him       that       we       had    some       property          which          was    handed             to      us

personally             in    the       day       to    hand       to    central          control.

We    then      w ent       into       the       ground          still       not    aware          of what             had       occurred.

Property          was       handed          to    a sergeant             and       we    t hen      looked             for       a

telephone.              I remember                looking             through       the       passageways                   under         the

North       stand       and       seeing          debris          scattered             on    the       floor.

I proceeded             towards             the       gymnasium          in    order          to    find       a       phone          and      once

inside          I was       met    by       a    mass       of    people       standing             around.                 As       I walked

through          I was       aware          of    bags       of       clothes       and       directly             behind             I saw       one

body       on    the    floor          apparently                being       searched.              Curiosity                got       the      better

of    me    and    I noticed                rows       of    dead       bodies          with       no    real          outside

injuries.              I wasn't             aware          that       they    were       dead       at    this          time.             I just

remember          feeling          numb.              I eventually             found          a    phone       and          tried         to    get

an    outside          line       to    no       avail.          As    I hung       the       phone       up       a    policewoman                  in

the    police          room       went          hysterical             and    I knew          something                was       wrong         but

what       I didn't          know.          I proceeded                with    PC       Patterson          to          Claywheels               Lane

where       I awaited             the       rest       of    our       serial.          Eventually             retiring                from

duty       at    6.45pm       (1845).                 On    my    way    back       to       the    car    I remembered                        seeing

a    helicopter             hovering             over       the       ground.       Once          alone    in          my    car       and

travelling             back       home          I remember             listening             to    Radio       Hallam.                 My      mind

             a t Barnsley Police Station for the FA Cup Semi             F i n a l ,   together with         j

             PS 1341 Crawford and other officers from B1, I travelled to

             Hillsborough Football Ground.          On arrival we were briefed by Senior

             Off i ce r s .
             At 10.50am (1050) together          with PS 1341 and officers of- serial 14                we

             attended at the West stand          for a further briefing by Inspector White,

             who went         into detail as to the duties of serial        14.

             BEFORE KICK OFF serial         14 was deployed on the inside              of the

             turnstiles A-G to search all fans entering the ground.

             KICK OFF         When all fans had entered the ground all of serial                 14 was to

             stand by in the tunnel of the West stand which leads to the centre

             enclosures.
              In the event of the emergency evacuation procedure being effected my

              duty was to attend at the gate in the fence between the Centre South

              and South enclosures.
              For the duration of the match I was to work in company with PC 1002

              Wild and we both were instructed by PS 1341 Crawford to pay attention

                 to the snack bar which was situated at the rear of the West stand on

  /er brief 1 ng« by Inspector White all officers of serial   14 took up

positions at turnstiles A to G, PC 1002 Wild and myself and PC 1278

Lang and PC 3232 Burton took up positions at turnstiles A and B.

When the turnstiles opened there were not many fans outside the

ground and prior to entering the ground were subject to a search and

were then subject to a further search once inside the ground.       Due to

this double searching of fans     I anticipated that there would besome

objections or adverse comment     regarding this but neither were

forthcoming at this time.

As the morning progressed and     the number of fans increased I saw

several   fans attempt to gain entry to the ground    via turnstiles A and

B, only to be told by the turnstile operator that they were at the

wrong turnstile.    They then had to force their way back towards the

other turnstiles onLeppings     Lane end.Around 1.00pm (1300) the

number of fansoutside    theground had greatly increased   and we   then

had to be more selective in our searching.     Around 2.30pm (1430) a

few fans cimbed the perimeter wall and were stood on the roof of the

turnstiles A to G; they were instructed to get down and were ejected

from the ground by other officers.

At this time there were several hundred people hanging around the

area of the turnstiles and due to the amount of fans now entering

the ground were asked to move from that area to allow fans in.

Several   people who had entered the ground complained that people at

the back of the crowd were pushing towards the front, and that the

Police should be aware of this.

At this I looked through the turnstiles towards Leppings Lane,

although my view was restricted I could see officers on foot and on

horseback who appeared to be attempting to control the surge towards

the turnstiles.

People were now struggling to enter the ground and in fact were being
                                                               PAGE   3

pushed into the wall and turnstile entrance itself.    Many fans were

now complaining that someone would be injured, and all officers at

the turnstiles should go outside.    All fans were informed that

officers inside had a task to perform and that officers outside

would be doing everything possible to alleviate the problem.

Around 2.40 pm I saw that several fans had again climbed the outer

wall and were on top of the turnstile entrance roof, they were

instructed to get down.   This they flatly refused to do.   I saw two

youths on the roof showing their tickets to Police officers they

were again instructed to get off the roof, but again refused.

By now many fans had congregated around the turnstiles and several

officers including myself were being surrounded by fans who were

being abusive towards us because they had been subjected to the

crush outside the turnstiles.    Fans were now being allowed into the

ground without the ticket stubs being torn off (this I presumed was

to allow quicker entry) and these were being passed to fans on the

roof who in turn began to throw them over the wall to fans awaiting

entry.

It had now got to the stage where searching was impossible due to

the amount of fans congregating inside the turnstile area and

together with several other officers we attempted to clear the

area.    This was met with verbal hostility towards the Police and

many fans appeared to be losing their tempers.

I formed the opinion that before too long a Police officer would be

physically assaulted, and due to the fact that only serial 14 was

deployed in that area, had an officer been assaulted then

assistance would have been very limited and the situation got out

of hand.    Thankfully this did not occur.

Whilst speaking with several fans I was approached by a man who

stated that he was a Merseyside Police officer, he said that

something             had       to       be    done       outsiae        or    people        would         be    i nj u r e d .          He

appreciated                the       pressure             we w e r e     under        but    something              had     to      be    done

and     f a st.

I informed                him       that       the    officers           outside            the      groundwould               be    doing

everything                possible.              At       this    he     left        and     w e n t into the              ground

without          formally                identifying             himself           to me.

Fans      were        still          congregating                round        the     area       inside         the       turnstiles               and

I made          several             request          for     them      to m o v e      away       to a l l o w        people         to       get

through          the       turnstiles                as    this     in    itself           was    creating            a    p r o b l e m for

fans      entering              the       ground.            I saw       fans         c l i m b i n g o v er the           turnstile               and

entering          2 at          a    time       but wa s         unable        to     prevent         t h i s due         to     the      number

of     f a ns    around             the       turnstiles.              These         people       j u st    disappeared                  into

Shortly          before             3.00pm       (13005          the m a i n        exit     gate       situated            near         to

turnstile             G    suddenly             opened        and      fans        began     to      surge       into       the      gr o u n d ,

several          officers                from    the       serial        ran       towards        the      gate and            1 joined

them      in a n          effort          to    close       the     g at e     Cl w a s      of      the    opinion            that       the

gate      had     been          forced          open       by fans)            but     this       was      impossible.

As     the      fans       surged             into    the     g ro u n d ,     many        chanting         as    they         ran,       I

turned          and       saw a gap             in the        centre          of    the     f an s    and       people         moving          to

the     left      ana       rig ht .            People        were       screaming           and      shouting,             I went            to

that      area        with          other       officers          and     found        that       people         were       on the            floor

having          tripped             or    been       pushed       over        in the        rush      to get          into      the

ground.           These             people       were       quickly           put     on    their       f e et    and moved               away

to     the      side       walls          away       from     the      rush.         Wot     one      person          complained               to

me     about      being             injured,,

The     majority            of       the       fans       went    towards           the     tunnel         leading         to       the

central          enclosure                but    some       did     go   to        the S o u t h     side        of   the W e s t             stand.

Eventually                the       gates       were       closed,       s om e       fans' w e r e        st ill     coming           through

t he    turnstiles               but       the       numbers        outside          were        greatly         reduced. -
Most     of    the      f an s      had      gone       into-the              stand and            the     rear w a s        almost

clear     with        just       a fe w f a n s             mi 1 1 ing a r o u n d .

Serial        14 w a s        then      deployed             onto        the      pitch after              a    report       of     a     pitch

invasion.             Access         to the            pitch       wa s       gained         via     the       gate       leading         from

the    South         side      of    the W e s t            stand        i n to     the      South       stand        and    walking

down     through           the      s e a t e d a r e a.           Whilst           walking          down'the S o u t h           stand          1

could     see        several         fans         climbing           over         the     perimeter                 f e n c e o n t o the

track     area        and      t h er e      were       a     l a rg e    number          of      fans     already          on    the

pitch.         There          were      a    la rge         number        of P o l i c e          officers           and    stewards           in

the    area      of     the      centre           enclosures              assisting               fans     to       get    out    via      the

emergency            e xi t    gates         or    over        the       perimeter             fence.

Some     officers             had     climbed           the        perimeter            fence        in a n         effort       to a s s i s t

people        over      the      fen c e.          I went           over       to    the       perimeter             fence       covering

the    central          south        enclosure               and     saw       t ha t     people h ad b e e n c r u s h e d

against        th e     perimeter                wall       and     fenc e ,        I would          estimate             that    about        40

to 3 0    bodies           were       la i d      up a g a i n s t        the       wall       on t o p        of    one    another.

Some     who    were          in a s t a n d i n g            position            up a g a i n s t       th e       fence    were         unable

to    move,      being         trapped            by    the        lower       half       of      their        body.        Some        were

still     breathing              but        it w a s        apparent           th a t     many were             dead.

The    area     around           the        emergency              exit       gate      of     the      centre        south       enclosure

was    congested              with      people          trying           to    get      out       and Police              officers

attempting            to      get     inside           to     rescue          the    i nj u re d.

I looked         towards            the      centre           north       enclosure               and    saw        that     p a r t of    the

perimeter            fence       ha d       been       pull e d away,               allowing            fans        greater       egress

onto     the     p it c h .         I then         climbed           the       fence         of    the     centre          south

enclosure            and      began         to    sway        on    the       fence       hoping         that        this    would         give

way    and     afford          greater            entry        into       the       enclosure.                 The    fence       di d     not

give     way    and        I climbed              down        onto       the      track.           I could           see    PS    1341

Crawford        was        s till       on       the    fence a s s isting                   a youth           over,       who    had

caught        hi s    clothing              on th e         top     of    the       fence         and was           in a    precarious

position.             I    moved          over       to ass-tst P S C r a w f o r d a n d                 as      I did          so the

youth        became        free       and       dropped          onto      the    track.            At    that      point          the    top

p ar t    of    one       of   a     crush          barrier       was      thrown       from        the     centre           south

enclosure            towards          the       pitch,          it wa s     about       5    i n ch      in d i a m e t e r ,        7 feet

It    hi t     the    to p      cf    the       perimeter           fence,        at    the       side      of P S       Crawford,

and      began       to    fall       towards             the    track      1 ducked          to a v o i d         it    hitting          me

and      caught       it w i t h          my    left       hand.          I managed          to     keep       hold      of       it a n d     it

did      not    strike          any       persons,            1 then       removed          the     item       onto      the       p i t c h to

avoid        any     person          fallmg            over      it.       By    no w m a n y       injured and                  dead    had

been      removed          from       the       enclosure           and were           being        attended            to       by St.

John      Ambulance             brigade,             s om e     fans      had    torn       down adve r t i s i n g               boardings

and      were      using        these          as    make       s h ift    stretchers             to     remove         people          from

the      pitch.

I then         saw Chief             Superintendent                 Nesbit        near       the       emergency             exit       gate,

he    was i n s t r u c t i n g o f f i c e r s to f o r m a line e i t h e r s i d e of the g a te to

allow        for     quicker          evacuation                of the      injured and                dead.

I formed           one     of      the      lines         and    assisted         in the          evacuation,                handling

many      bodies          n o ne     of     which         I can d e s c r i b e .

A f t e r al l       the       injured          and       dead     ha d    been     removed            from       the    enclosures

and      pitch       I remained                in the         a r e a and. j o i n e d       several           other         officers

from      our      se r i a l ,      we     were       instructed           by P S C r a w f o r d          to     r e m a i n at        that

location           until        he    had       established               the    whereabouts              of      all    officers

from      the      serial.

Several         fans       were       going          round and            shaking       officers            hands,           thanking

them      for      what        they       had       done.

A message            was       then       passed          over     the     public       address           system         by       p ol i c e

control         stating            t ha t      the     match       had     been     abandoned,              and     that          fans

would        be a l l o w e d        to     le a v e      once     emergency           services           had      c l e a r e d away,

from      the      ground.            When          the    fans were            allowed        to      l e av e    serial          14 was

  Eventually           th e    majority       of    the     serial    were      released        from    the   ground

                       Evidence concerning events of Saturday 15th April 1989             C-




        On the day in question I paraded for duty at Ecclesfield Police station
        at 0900 hours, I was then transported by Bus to Hillsborough football
        ground where upon arrival X confirmed that I was be part of serial ^9
        patrolling the Foxhill area of Sheffield in a Transit van, Tango


        Myself and other meabers of this serial took our seats in the North Stand
        for the breifing by senior and intelligence officers before collecting our
        meals and comencing patrol at approximately 1 0 ,5 0 hours*


        Our first port of call was “The Fox public house situated on Foxhill Road,
        This is a fairly large pub with a very large tarmacadam carpark and grassed
        area ooening onto the above road. At about 11,05 hours myself and Inspector
        Robinson visited the Landlord in the Lounge Bar of the premises. He stated
        that he had five extra staff cm duty and had retained the services of "a big
        lad" as doorman. He also said that he had extra beer and lager on and that he
        would be welcoming Liverpool supporters. At this time there were a few locals
        drinking in the pub and about two "families'1 of Liverpool supporters with
        y m m g children. These supporters were quietly minding their own business ,
        The manager was advised that we would be patrolling the area and calling by
        regularly and that we should be contacted in the event of any need for assistance.


       " We then resumed patrol , checking-visually other pubs in the area. Most were
         either quiet ofcloded. However during this time many supporters began to flood
         into the side streets' in this area and park their private cars and vans.


         At 11.30 hrs we again checked The Fox public house. It was staaing to fill up
         with crowds of LFC fans standing outside drinking in the sunshine. The surrounding
         streets in Foxhill and uptowards Grenoside were now very busy with the vehicles
         of arriving fans ; to the extent that it made maneuvering of our shortwheelbase
         transit van very difficult. We then observed that traffic       flowing freely down
         Halifax Road from the North with many supporters,    arriving in private cars, vans
         and hire minibuses. These vehicles were turning off into the Foxhill and Parson

         Cross estates; presumably to park.


         At 12.10 we again during our patrols checked The Fox pub. The car park was now
                                                      _____________ a                     cont/-


                                                          V   T
full to capacity with people standing very close to each other, sitting
on cars and standing on the boundary wall ; all drinking alcohil.


At 12.30 we were directed by control to attend at Wilcox Road, Foxhill
where youths were reported to be acting disorderly manner and urinating
in peoples front gardens. At the scene we liaised with PCs stationed at
the bottom of the road who stated that 5-6 liverpool fans had passed them
being abusive and throwing down beer cans. Some of this team were observed
to go up Wilcax Rd and urinate in gardens. We saw this group of youths
walking up that road and stopped and spoke to them. All had been drinking
heavily and were in a very boisterous mood. They were advised and pointed
inthe direction of the ground. We followed then down the hill and near the
bottom they all boarded a SYPTE bus bound for the town centre.


At 12,50 we again visually checked the Fox pubilc house. By now the car park
was bursting to capacity and fans stood drinking some distance up and down
Foxhill Road on the Pavement on both sides drinking alcohol purchased from
The Fox. I would estimate the number in the car park and walls alone to
be in the region of ^.bout 300 to **00. With a further 200? standing on the
pavement and pull-'in on the opposite pavement.   Thssre was in there number
a large drunken, rowdy contingent who cat called as we passed and who
continued to do so when we paused for observations.


At 1300 hours we checked the White HORSE public house on Halifax/Southey green
Road. This, too, was full of LFC supporters and the scene was very similar to
that at The Fox.


At 13-05 hours we receive a message from control to attend at|              ,a
newsagent,tobacconist and confectionary shop opposite the Fox pub. The
manegeress stated that six drunken LFC fans had come into her shop and
acted disorderly before stealing cigarettes and sweets. She followed them
outside where they were very abusive and threatening and saw them drive off
in a White 'Renault van registered number


At 15.15 hrs I saw the van being driven on Halifax Road. We followed to the
car park of The White Horse pub where it parked up. After a short conversation
the six occupants of the van were arrested by me and placed in our police
van. They were then transported to EPS arriving at 13«l+0 hours.
                                                                   cant/-

 The prisoners were all Liverpool supporters1ranging in age from 18 yrs to
 37 years. They had.    1 been drinking both in the van on the way over and
 at The Fox public house. They stated that they had arrived in planty of
  time at about 12.15 hours. When booking the prisoners property in it was
  found that not all of then had tickets for the match.



 It was ascertained that all six had attended Sheffield for the match with only
 TWO West stand ticket between them. They had managed to swap one of these
 tickets for TWO lepping lane terrace tickets; brining the total held to T5SE5
 between SIX. The prisoners told me that they had heard that tickets would be
 on sale from touts at the ground and that last year the officials at the ground
 had let some in without checking tickets owing to the rush because of the
 match starting. It.was further noted when booking in property that there was
 very little cash between them. And certainly some of those without match tickets

 did not have sufficent funds -to purchase tickets at TOUTS prices;' indeed thay
 only had loose change.


 This was noted at the time and subject of discussion between myself and the
 custody officer. Obviously the full significance of this information did not
 become apparent until later* but the custody records corroborating this
 evidence re property are a v a H i b l e for examination at Ecclesfield .police station.
 It appeared to me at the time that if these prisoners had insuficient funds        to
 buy tickets and that they -ere determined to get into see the mafcch ( this was
...more than apparen by the noise and ^complaints comraing from the cells when they
 were detained) then they were going to attempt to gain enrty by some means. This
 is again corroborated by the fact that they had turned up on spec without money
but with the knowledge that people had some how gained enrty at the last minute last
year because of the rush.


The prisoners were all held whilst     I liaised with CID regarding their interview.
At about 15.15 hours I was in the CID office when PC 12^2 Armitage called me
and told me that OPERATION SUPPORT was required at the ground. My transit had
departed earlier so I was driven in a police car to the ground in co PC 12^2
Armitage, PS 2269 Strafford and Inspector Hudson. We arrived at the Leppings
lane end at about 15*30 hours. We parked the car in a side street and all headed
towards the tumsiles. Fans were pouring out of the ground some confused, some
angry and others obviously distressed by s o m e t h i n g . _______________   j- /______
As I approached the gate in front of the turnstiles, a few paces behind
Inspector Hudson, I saw a LFC fan attack him and try to punch him.            Hudson
managed to restrain the youth who was upset and crying, I assisted him and
pulled the youth off and took him away from the scene.          During the struggle
I received an injury to my right foot; it was not serious and the bruise
only lasted a few days.     I tried to calm him down but he kept shouting
"There is fucking dead bodies in there".       I released the youth to the
custody of friends and returned to the main gates.


I had NO personal radio so I was unaware of the circumstances of the
incident however I assumed there had been some sort of crush, perhaps a wall
collapse.    A mass of people were pouring out of the gates at Leppings Lane.
Most of them did not know what had happened either and seemed mostly
concerned with the fact that they had not gained entry or wished to know if
the. match was abandoned.


However quite a few of their number informed me that some supporters had
been crushed because of a massive surge or that a gate had been opened by
the police or stewards.     I was on my own now so I tried to move fans out of
the path of oncoming emergency vehicles; the progress of which they were
hampering.    I sensed that something very disasterous had happened from the
mood and tears of fans.     I continued to try to clear the roadway but the
mood of some fans was very aggressive fuelled by the fact that they were
heavily under the    influence of intoxicants. I was jostled and abused by
these drunken fans    and whilst attempting tomove a large congregation from
the path of a fire engine, I was punched on the right shoulder by an unknown
assailant and jeered and insulted by the rest of thegroup.         Some   still had
beer cans in their hands.


The situation had become potentially very violent with all the violence and
abuse apparently directed at the police.       I was still in the dark about the
incident or requirements as I was on my own without a personal radio.            After
the task of keeping fans off the road became fruitless and dangerous to my
personal safety, I looked further down Leppings Lane and saw my serial in
their transit van.     PS   2207   Shaw saw me andgot me back into the van.
Crowds of LFC fansjeered and rocked the van as they passed.         Several     police
motorcyclists parked across from us became very vulnerable to attack by fans
and after a few close calls had to move on.       The fans shouted "Murderers" to
us and other officers as they walked by.


The Sgt in the van had a personal radio but the reception and communication
was very bad.    Inspector Robinson got out of the van to go to police control
                                                            ^                  — — ___
to find out what assistance we could render or if our vehicle could be of
any use.    We heard over a domestic pocket radio that fans had been killed.


Inspector Robinson returned and stated that our van was needed as an
ambulance and that we were needed to assist at the mortuary area, situated
in the gym.    We left the driver with the van and walked through the extreme
left hand gate at Leppings Lane and down along behind the North stand
towards the g y m .


I was detailed by the Inspector to go to the gym to ask if any more numbers
were needed inside.     Luckily a Sergeant on the door stated that there was
enough help but asked that we keep fans looking for lost family/friends as
well as sightseers away.     Our serial along with some men drafted in from
Barnsley formed a cordon along a line between the corner of the North Stand
and some outbuildings parallel to the stand.


We allowed only stretchers bearing the dead and injured through as well as
Police, nurses, doctors, ambulancemen and other officials.     Some fans
carrying IPs were allowed to take them through.     Ambulances reversed up to
our cordon and IPs were taken away.     Many fans approached our line in a very
distressed state inquiring after lost party members.     Many became aggressive
and violent at not being allowed to look through the dead and injured for
them.    Again many of the most aggressive and violent fans had been drinking
and still smelled heavily of intoxicants.     At one point I received a kick
from a fan being refused access, to the back of my left knee.        He was
removed after a struggle with sober friends and other officers.


InspectorRobinson and PS Shaw then asked members of our serial to assist
with a makeshift casualty desk.     I took details and descriptions of those
missing from fans and asked them to return to their transport in case the
missing person was looking for them.     Some were bussed down to Hammerton
Road Police Station to give info to the Casualty Bureau.


At about 1800 hours, serial 49 was asked to return to their van at
Claywheels Lane, pending further assignment.     Reunited with the van, we had
to attend several times at the Northern General Hospital to deal with fans
fighting with pressmen.     Other Officers were present at the scene and we
acted as back up.     We were eventually stood down at 2000 hours.     I had a
meal at Claywheels and went off duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 2030
hours.                                                                        _______
On return to Ecclesfield I learned that my six prisoners had all been released
at about 13.15 hours with a warning but no further action to be taken against
themo

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

     15TH APRIL 1989

Report, statements and documents
showing behaviour of Liverpool
fans before, during and after
the Disaster.

          South Yorkshire Police


HTLLSBOROUOi STADIUM DISASTER 15TH APRIL, 1989

I have to report that I have been investigating the behaviour pattern of
Liverpool Football Club Supporters at matches played away from heme. I
have limited this enquiry to the 1987/88 and 1988/89 Football Seasons.

There have been a number of areas which I have looked at including the
behaviour of fans on the day of the disaster. I have categorised the
various enquiries and will outline the sailient points under each heading.

1.      POLICE REPORTS CONCERNING LIVERPOOL AWAY MATCHES WHERE PROBLEMS
         HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WITH LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

1.1     Everton versus Liverpool, the F.A.-Gup Final played at Wartibley
         on 10 May 1986. There was a capacity crowd of 98,000. Over
         1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in possession
         of forged tickets. 25 Police Officers were injured.

1.2     Tottenham Hotspur versus Liverpool on 28 November 1987. Enquiries
         with New Scotland Yard Public Order Branch and having seen the Police
         Report on this match,it was declared 'all ticket' with a capacity
         crowd of 47,363. A total of 10,311 Liverpool Supporters visited
         White Hart Lane out of which 2,000 Liverpool Supporters were
         locked out of the ground. This group caused policing problems
         in that shop windows were broken in Tottenham High Road but they
         ware eventually dispersed, into an underground station.

1.3     Watford versus Liverpool on 13 February 1988. This match'was
        declared 'all ticket' with a total crowd attendance of 23,838
        which included 6,200 Liverpool fans. 1,500 Liverpool fans, some
        of whom had been drinking, arrived without tickets. Given that
        it would have presented severe policing difficulties and problems
        were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and run the town of
        Watford and frequent local public houses, consultations between
        Club Officials and the Match Commander ended in a decision to
        allow the fans into the ground on payment.

1.4     Liverpool versus Wimbledon the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
        on 14 May 1988. Again there was a capacity crowd of 98,000, 92
        fans were arrested, 85 of than from Liverpool. Over 3,000 persons
        were ejected from the Stadium for possession of either forged
        tickets or no tickets at all. The Stadium authorities recovered
        478 forged tickets. Seven Police Officers were injured. The
        majority of those rejected were Liverpool fans and the majority
        of forged tickets were presented by Liverpool supporters.

1.5     Southampton versus Liverpool on 24 September 1988. This match
        was declared 'all ticket'. 150 Liverpool fans arrived without
        tickets. Those fans were isolated outside the ground and again
        because manpower would have been soaked up by allowing the fans
        to roam Southampton, they were allowed into the ground on payment,
        after discussions between the Match Commander and Club Officials.
                                -2-

1.6    Arsenal versus Liverpool on 9 November 1988. The Match Corrmanders
        report that a capacity crowd attended the match with approximately
        6,000 fans being locked out of the Stadium. The kick-off was
        delayed for 15 minutes to allow the fans to get into the ground.
       Many of the locked out fans attempted to climb or break into the
        Stadium. Reinforcements had to be called in. Not all of the
        locked out fans were Liverpool supporters.

1.7    Southampton versus Liverpool on 12 December 1988. This match
        was also declared 'all ticket'. 750 Liverpool fans arrived at
        the ground without tickets. Many related a story of being unable
        to purchase a ticket from the Office at Liverpool because it had
        not been opened to sell tickets for a sufficiently long enough
       period. The ticketless fans were isolated and although the situation
       was tense for a while the Southanpton Football Club agreed to
        open a turnstile and after payment allow all the fans into the
        ground.

1.8    Millwall versus Liverpool on 29 January 1989. The match was declared
        'all ticket', with a crowd of 23,615 of which 2,900 were Liverpool
        supporters. Several hundred Liverpool supporters attended without
        tickets and forged tickets were being sold outside the ground.
        No other problems were encountered.

1.9    Hull City versus Liverpool on 18 February 1989. This was an F.A.
        Cup Round and a particularly troublesome match for the Section
        Ccnrnander in charge of the Liverpool fens. Forged tickets were
        in evidence and a number of fans arrived without tickets. There
       was evidence that the majority of Liverpool fans had been drinking
        heavily. 100 ticketless fans outside the ground rushed a gate,
       when it was being opened by Stewards to allow someone to leave
        the ground, and at the same time Liverpool fans inside the ground
        also rushed the gate and attempted to pull it wide open. With
        the assistance of Mounted Officers the situation was eased but
        ticketless fans outside, when the turnstiles were closed, shouted
        comments to the Police Officers that if the turnstiles were not
        opened they would rip the gates off and 'nobody closed doors on
        Liverpool supporters'.

1.10   Norwich City versus Liverpool on 1 April 1989. This match was
       declared 'all ticket' but information was received by the Club
       that 1,272 tickets allocated to Liverpool had not been sold and
       would be returned to Norwich on the team bus on the day of the
       match. A nurfcer of Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets
       and gave varying reasons for not knowing the match was 'all ticket'
       or that they had come from areas distant from Liverpool. It was
       decided to sell the 1,272 unsold tickets returned by the
       Liverpool Club to get them into the ground. All the tickets were
       sold although it is believed some Norwich supporters also
       benefitted this way and got into the ground.
                                 -3 -

1.11   Wimbledon versus Liverpool on 13 May 1989. This match was declared
       'all ticket' with a capacity crowd of 14,730 of which 6,473 were
       Liverpool supporters. Enquiries with the Public Order Branch
       at New Scotland Yard reveal that Liverpool F.C. was allocated
       6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for supporters to
       be advised by means of local radio and the press that the fixture
       was an 'all ticket' one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned
       to Wimbledon F.C. On the day, nearly 6,500 Liverpool supporters
       attended the game, excluding a number who entered the home supporters
       parts of the Stadium. It was clear that a large number of
       Liverpool supporters attended without tickets despite publicity
       before the match. Turnstiles were opened to facilitate those
       supporters who had come without tickets.

1.12   Evert on versus Liverpool on 20 May 1989. This was the F. A. Cup
        Final played at the Wembley Stadium, some 5 weeks after the
        Hillsborough Disaster. The report from the Section commander
        tends to show that Liverpool supporters had not learned from this
        disaster. Ticketless fans caused considerable problems for the
        Police and when they were clearing the area of those fans, bottles
        and cans were thrown at them. Just before the end of the game
        all gates to the Stadium were opened in preparation for the exodus.
        An equalising goal was then scored by Evert on which resulted in
        an influx of fans who had been leaving and also those still around
        the ground without tickets. All managed to get into bays around
        the Stadivm to watch extra time.

2.      WITNESS STATEMENTS WHICH SHOW HOW CERTAIN LIVERPOOL FANS INTENDED
        TO GET II7TO THE MATCH

2.1    Julie Dawn SHELLEY is a part-time barmaid who assists behind the
        bar at her         licensed premises, The Matilda Public House,
        Matilda Street, Sheffield. From mid-day on the day of the disaster,
        she had a conversation with three to four male persons who described
        themselves as Liverpool supporters. They told her they had ccrns
        from Liverpool on the train, had no tickets for the match but
        it was their intention to go to Hillsborough and gain entry.
        They further told her that it was easy because they had done it
        previously and there were other Liverpool fans who had cane down
        with them without tickets who were going to get into the ground
        as well. They left the public house by taxi to the ground between
        2.30pm and 2.45pm.

2.2    Garry TAYLOR who is a retired Sales Director was drinking in The
        Sioey Public House, Sicey Avenue, Sheffield, some 1^ miles from
        the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the disaster. Whilst in
        the premises he heard a conversation between three men sat nearby.
        Two of the men spoke with Liverpool accents and he assumed they
       were supporters of that club. He heard thorn talk about Leppings
        Lane and that they would meet up with others outside the Leppings
        Lane entrance. They would organise as many other people as possible
        to cause whatever trouble they could. If enough trouble was caused
        the gates would have to be opened. Mr. TAYLOR concluded that
        this had happened before and the person doing the talking appeared
        confident that this action could be forced. More detailed evidence
        can be read in his statement.
                         -4 -

Peter Kevan MARJORAM is a Conpany Director who visited The Pheasant
Public House, Oughtibridge, some 2 \ miles from the Hillsborough
Stadium, on the day of the disaster. He arrived at 2.35pm to
find numerous persons both inside and outside the public house.
He would estimate that 25 of than were Liverpool supporters.
He got into conversation with two of than. They did not mention
tickets, neither did Mr. MARJORAM see them in possession of one.
At 2.45pm he mentioned to the two that they were leaving it late
to get to the ground and one of them replied 'Don't worry about
that, we know either a gate will be open or opened'. Both men
laughed at each other. The two left shortly afterwards.

              is a Quantity Surveyor who was also in The Pheasant
Public House on the date of the disaster and was joined by Mr.
MARJORAM sometime, he says, after 2.00pm. He corroborates that
one of the two Liverpool supporters he and Mr. MARJORAM were talking
to said words to the effect that they were confident of getting
into the ground because the gate would be open or opened. The
manner in which this remark was made did not suggest that they
intended to force entry into the ground. He describes the two
men as decent persons and they did not say that they had tickets
for the match and he did not see them in possession of any.

Statements from the four witnesses are attached to this report
under Appendix 'B'.


SCHEDULE SHOWING EVIDENCE THAT CAN BE GIVEN FROM WITNESSES REGARDING
LIVERPOOL FANS ATTENDING THE MATCH WITHOUT TICKETS

There is anple evidence of fans arriving at this match without
tickets to get into the Hillsborough Ground. Attached is a schedule
showing that 25 Police Officers have submitted reports showing
numerous fans without tickets, fans asking for spare tickts, fans
asking for the tickets of those arrested, evidence of fans coming
to the match expecting to buy tickets from touts, evidence of
fans having tickets snatched, evidence of seeing stubs from tickets
being thrown back into the crowd and evidence of persons complaining
of having their tickets stolen.

The 25 reports submitted showing this evidence appears to be only
 'the tip of the iceberg'. Further reports are still being processed
from other officers which will no doubt contain a lot of similar
material.

Further evidence in relation to this matter can be given by civilian
witnesses listed under Appendix 'B'.

A schedule showing the report number, the time, location, the
officer involved and a brief srnmary of what he could say is
attached to this report under Appendix 'C'.

4.    EVIDENCE OF THE BEHAVIOUR OF FANS AT TOE SEMI FINAL MATCH BETWEEN
       NORWICH AND EVERTON PLAYED AT VILLA PARK CM 15TH APRIL 1989

4.1   A statement from Chief Superintendent Mellor, the Match Comnander
       at the Semi Final match played the same day between Norwich City
       and Ever ton at Villa Park, showing the behaviour of the fans,
       especially those supporting Evert o n , together with two of his
       Mounted Officers is attached.

4.2   Whilst the evidence does not have   any bearing on the match played
       between Liverpool and Nottingham   Forest at Hillsborough, or the
       fans who attended the match, the   Everton supporters behaviour
       at Villa Park shows a remarkable   coincidence with the Liverpool
       supporters at Hillsborough which   may indicate some Liverpool
       characteris tic.

4.3   Statements from the three Police Officers are attached and have
       been listed under Appendix 'D'.


5.     OBSERVATIONS AND CCMMENTS

5.1    It does appear that there is a nucleus of Liverpool supporters
        (unidentified) who do travel to matches played away from Liverpool
        without tickets and cause severe policing problems. At the end
        of the day, rather than soak up Police manpower, it is felt better
        to allow them into the ground, if possible, rather than than cause
        havoc in the town, their team is playing. Whilst there is no
        direct evidence to support this, the fans do appear to know this.
        In the case at Watford where numerous ticketless fans arrived
        they did imply that if they were not granted admission to the
        ground they would go into Watford and cause havoc.

5.2    The evidence   in the attached reports etc., has been gathered from
        material in   possession of the South Yorkshire Police. Given the
        opportunity   to read and study the many civilian statements taken
        by the West   Midlands Investigation Team, it may be that the
        evidence to   hand could be enhanced further.

5.3    Since the 1 January, 1989, theF.A. Cup match played at Hull   and
        the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley both show a similarity in
        crowd behaviour to that displayed on the date this disaster occurred.

                        arrested.   Outside the stadium 7 Everton and 21 Liverpool
                        supporters were arrested.

                        Over 1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in
                        possession of forged tickets. Twenty five police officers were
                        injured.
       (b)     On l^th May 1988 the F.A. Cup Final - Liverpool -v- Wimbledon.

               A capacity crowd of 98,000 attended; 92 fans were arrested, 85
               from Liverpool and 7 from Wimbledon. Over 3,000 persons were
               ejected from the stadium for possession of either forged
                       or n® ticket at all, The stadium authorities recovered
                7” forged tickets.   Seven police officers were injured.


I hope that the brief summaries of the above matches, in addition to that
already furnished in respect of the 1989 P.A, Cup Final held on the 20th May
1909 , will be of assistance.

 RE:   LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
 played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
 13 February 1988,  the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
 included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

 Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
 this particular g am e . I was responsible for policing outside the
 Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx­
 imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had arrived without tickets.     The
 game, which had been declared 'All Ticket' at Police instigation, was
 well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
 attending were in possession of tickets. Some of the 1,500 fans had
 been drinking and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
 behaviour was generally good. The prevailing weather, without doubt,
 assisted the policing of the crowd and after consultation with
 Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to- hold the 1,500 supporters in the
 Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
 Stadium. Given that it would have presented severe policing
 difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
 run the town and frequent local public houses. After further consul­
 tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
 prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment.    I was aware
 that there would be sufficient room in the Stadium to accommodate
 these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
 I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
 attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates. The match was
 relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
 and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

 At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
 visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
 Stadium.

8.   COM MENTS ON POLICING TACTICS

     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws etc.:


         Searching carried out at turnstiles. Escorts to Shuttle Trains from Stadium
         to '-.'atford Junction. Large number of Liverpool Supporters travelled back into
         London on the Local trains* No problems.

         The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non-ticket holders was a
         success and will be done at future all-ticket games where this is likely to
         prove a problem.

                    I submit tliis report at the request of D.I. KING of
       Sfluth Yorkshire Police, Hillsborough Incident Room based at Police
       Headquarters, Sheffield, Fax. No. 0742 523243. Tho report has been
       requested to assist tho Barrister representing Police at the Hillsborough
       Enquiry In connection with the behaviour of Liverpool fans at other all
       tfcket matches in recent years.

         |          I have to report that the First Division League match
       bitween Southampton and Liverpool on Saturday, 24th September, 1900
       w is an all ticket m8lch and had been advertisod as such. Pre match
       ii formation was that only 1,700 tickets had been sold to Liverpool
       fins, although tho whole of the Archers Road end (capacity 4,000)
       h id been, given over to their fans. Concern was expressed that a
       lirge number of Liverpool fans might therefore turn up without tickots
       a Liverpool Foolball Club had only sold tickets to callers at their
       g ound and not sent any tickots out by post as a postal strike was
       taking place at the time. Plans wore therefore made in advanco
       tq ask any fans who arrived without tickots, to queue in Silverdalo
       Road, noar to the ground so Police could identify the scale of the
          oblem in terms of fans without tickets. Such fans wore told that
          ere was no guarantee of them getting in. 150 of those who arrived
          thout tlukols chose to queue in this fashion.

                   Near kick off time it was decided by Superintendent
         IOMPSON that an approach would be made to tho club to open a
       cjsh turnstile to allow these fens access.

                   The main reasons for this wore that:

                   1.    Manpower on the     day was limited to 0 P.S.U.s and
                         tho crowd had exceeded the previous Liverpool
                         fixtures by 3,000 on ticket sales, so it was felt
                         that 150 fans wandoring in the town, frustrated
                         at not getting into the match, could have soaked
                         up manpower, which would havo boon better
                         committed at the ground.

           2, A local couple had booked tho Church next
               to the ground in Archers Road for a wedding at
               15,30 hours in the mistaken belief that It was
               not b match day. They had phoned the Police
               3 days before requesting assistance to avoid
               disruption of the service. The presence of 150
               frustrated fans in the area would not have boon
               a good start to married life,

           3.   It was felt that the postal strike had frustrated
                the 'all tickot1 systom.

           The Club Secretary agreed to open a cash turnstile

i
hortly after 15,00 hours and the fans were let in.

             The Liverpool fans behaved well throughout the match
 ,nd there was little evidence of drunkcness.  Five Liverpool fans
were ejocted from the ground for breaches of tho ground
iegulations. Two Liverpool fans were arrested for being drunk
 tnd disorderly before the match. Two were arrested in tho ground
 or drunkenese. This is        bolow the 8ver&g© for matches     the
 )ell during the 1988-09 season.

           I ask that this report bo Faxed to the Incident Room
>n the above number for the information of D.I. KING.

COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS:

Late arrival of fans estimated 30 to 40 thousand arrived after 7pm

Radio reception on Force radios intermittent.

Intelligence from TO 20 Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC indicated a crowd
of 45,000 to 50,000.

A crowd of 54,000 inside the ground and approximately 6000 locked out
was beyond the police resources employed as per grade 'B' matches.

The presence in Gillespie Road of a considerable number of fans before
the turnstiles opened prevented police removal vehicles operating and
therefore parked cars added to the obstruction.

Turnstiles at Gillespie Road ran out of change causing delay and further
congestion in Gillespie Road.

Fans ignored Police instruction to form queues not enough Police present
to enforce instructions.

Kick Off delayed by me until 8pm but many of the locked out fans attempted
to climb or break into the stadium.

The only police available to police outside the ground after kick off
were Mounted Section and Dog Section until reinforcements arrived from
West Ham FC match and Commissioner's reserve.

While Mounted Branch, Dog Section and local officers were splendid ’Aid
serials’ generally seemed overwhelmed by the situation and were not as active
as one would hope.

Searching at turnstiles had to be abandoned because of crush.*

There were few problems inside the stadium during the match.

Due to late kick off and extra time match finished at 10.20pm in nil nil draw,
therefore fans only interested in getting home and the dispersal prsented
no problems.

Future Plans

Due to Arsenal's successful season and Tottenham's failures crowds are larger
than expected at Highbury therefore policing levels are to be reviewed.

For evening matches Commissioner's regulations will have to be 3 hours before
kick off instead of 2 hours to enable vehicles to be removed before crowds
arrive*                                                       “

Turnstiles will be opened earlier and Arsenal are to supply a PA System into

           For the Attention of Chief Superintendent T.J.WAIW


           Dear Sir,

                                            Re:    Letter dated 7th June 1989

                     On Saturday 12th December 1988, I was on duty in uniform as the
           Superintendent in charge of the First Division Football League match between
           Southampton and Liverpool at the Dell, Southampton; kick off 1500 hours.

                      The match was an ’all ticket' match in that entry to the ground for
           Liverpool fans would only bo allowed if they arrived with a ticket already
           purchased.


                     At 1345 hours it became obvious that a large number of fans
           supporting Liverpool did not have tickets.

                     Our strict and rigid policy at the Doll has always been that fans
           who arrive without tickets will not be allowed entry and that the Club will
           not open a turnstile.

                     However, on this occasion there were about 750 Liverpool fans
           without tickets. Many related a story of being unable to purchase a ticket
           from the office at Liverpool because it had not been opened to sell tickets
           for a sufficiently long enough period.

                     Therefore, I got all 750 into an orderly queue and Southampton
           Football Club opened a turnstile and charged them all £5 per head entry
           instead of tne usual £3.50.

                     The situation was extremely tense for a while and we had to use much
           tact and good humour to avoid a situation of serious disorder.

                     We were helped by the fact that we still had room inside for those
           750. Had that not been so then controlling those locked out would have been a
           major problem.

                                                  Yours faithfully,

                                                   \ A \

           a Razor ttlade or a Stanley Knife. He was unable to identify his attackers* Liverpool
     .     supporters,.walking to the rear of the ground via a Walkway, threw stones into Cold
         'Slow Lane; but they fell amongst other Liverpool Supporters*
     '(b) Inside Ground:             '              .   a

            Only Minor problems inside the ground during the game. One Millwsll supporter got
            over the fence on to the pitch but was detained* After the final whistle, Millwall
            Supporters forced two gates and got out into rear car park.


         (c) Immediate vicinity of Ground:
            As a result of the above incident, serious disorder took place in the car park. A
              total of Fourteen Officers were injured. Four Police Vehicles were damaged One
              seriously. Three Liverpool supporters were seriously assaulted and several Liverpoc
              Coaches damaged. .

8.   COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS
     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws, etc:

     All the Liverpool Coaches attended the meeting point at Sower Bridge as .arranged. They
     were escorted to the ground without any incidents. Several hundred Liverpool Supporters
     from the London Area attended without tickets. An unknown stale obviously “from Liverpool
     was selling forged tickets in the car park for £15- Several persons obtained entry to
     the ground with these tickets but several were noticed at the.turnstiles and the holders
     refused entry. The seller was not located. Apart from the supporters who attended by
     Coach, the rest arrived via service trains and by their own means. In the main, they
     were well behaved. Because of the position of the Turnstiles i.e. only at each end of the
     ground, the main problems were getting all the Millwall supporters into the ground before
     the start. Many arrived late the worse for drink. The game took place with only minor
     incidents. Considering Millwall were well beaten, not too much was thrown onto the pitch.
     Some damage was caused inside the ground when Millwall supporters forced their way out

     into the car park. Lack of lighting in the Car Park was again the main problem together
     with all the debris lying about. The Liverpool Supporters who had attended by train
     were escorted to the railway station and seen off to London without any problems. To look
     back on the day, a total of 52 persons were injured. The Dog Section suffered the most,
     with Seven Officers injured One with serious back injuries. Following many games without
     any disorder, this one game showed that the Hooligan element is still present waiting to*
     strike. The main targers being visiting supporters, their coaches and Police Officers.
     The Chief Superintendent from Liverpool attended the fixture                as an observer together
     with Inspector CLOW the F.L.O. $nd a Sergeant. We were unable to offer them any decent
     hospitality but they seemed to understand. I think they also appreciated the problems in
     Peliceing First Division fixtures with a Third Division ground surrounded by waste land*

HULL C UT V LIVERPOOL, SATURDAY 1 8 .2 ,8 9
P A CUP 5 th ROUND MATCH ~ VENUE B o O m M Y



Further to the general report sent on the 8 June 19&9 with regard to
a summary of the day’s events, I submit my observations as to the
conduct of Liverpool supporters at the turnstiles atf the North East
corner of Boothferry Park, Hull which are used by a^ay supporters
wishing to enter the ground.

I was the Sector Commander responsible for the Nortfy East turnstiles
and the two designated areas allocated to Liverpool:supporters,
these being the North Stand and the enclosure on th& north end of the
East Stand which are connected by a large gate close to the perimeter
wall of the playing area, allowing free access to ai|d from the two
areas,                                             .!

Prior to the match I was engaged outside the turnstiles, all of which
were open, admitting Liverpool supporters upon production of a match
ticket (this being an all ticket match).

F orged T ic k e ts                                      j
                                                         !
It was discovered that many fans had several batches^ of tickets all
bearing the sam e serial number, there being severalj different numbers
used.   Some of the tickets appeared to have been pointed and others
were poor quality photocopies, all being of a similar colour to the
genuine tickets (yellowish). The fans stated they!had bought them
close to the ground and inLiverpool fromtouts.     Arrests of the
sellers were made byofficers otherthan my Sector i t a f f .
                                                         s

Offers   of Cash                                     :
I was approached, as were my staff, by Liverpool f a i l s with £10 or
£20 notes held in their hands asking if we could possibly get them
into the ground.   T h e y were informed this was not possible and
several made attempts to several different officers 1
                                                         !
Behaviour of .E^ns                                   !

The general behaviour of the fans at the turnstiles jwas peaceful but
it was evident that the majority of the Liverpool fins had been
drinking intoxicants heavily.

        The fans formed up at the turnstiles and were marshalled into orderly
        lines with officers carrying out good hearted searches,

        I was informed by Stewards from inside the ground tljiat several
        fans had jumped over or crawled under the turnstile!and entered
        the North Stand.

        There are 2 wire meshed gates between the turnstile* and fans who
        had entered the ground were passing their retained tjialf of the
        tickets to fans outside who tried to gain entry alleging they had
        lost the other part of the ticket or had it snatched from them.

        The crowd were physically pushed back from these gates at which
        point the fans inside crumpled up their retained paij*t of the ticket
        and threw them out of the ground for fans outside t<i> pick up*

        Then, shortly before the kick off time, I had my bacfck to the wire-gates
        observing about 100 fans who were without tickets aijid had gathered
        close to the turnstiles.
                                                                I
        From their conversation they were of the opinion thit we would let
        them in the ground shortly after kick off.   They wire informed this
        was not to be the course of action we would take and they would not
        be admitted without tickets.   From the replies I firmed the opinion
        that this was an expected course of action and had happened at other
        grounds.

        These fans then started to rush towards me at which1point I noticed the
        gate had been opened by a Steward to allow someone to leave the ground.

        Fans from inside rushed to the gate attempting to pUtll the gate wide
        open and appeared to be trying to lift it off the hinges which they
        could not do because of restraining pins through th4 hinges.

        A short struggle ensued and with the help of Mounted Officers fans
        were bodily thrown and pushed from the gate and we Managed to re-
        secure the gate.   Prompt action by my staff and Club Stewards
        prevented the gate from being fully opened and only Ia small number
        of non-ticket holders entered the ground and ran into the crowd
        knocking fans out of the way in their efforts to mingle with the
        standing crowd.   I instructed my officers not to pursue these
        fans.                                               I

        After this the Mounted Section pushed all fans without tickets onto
        the car park.   I then lined officers from the Dog Section with their
        dogs on leads across the front of the turnstiles and the Mounted
        Section allocated me two officers, one to each wirejgate between
        the turnstiles to preserve a sterile area.   After all fans with
        tickets had entered, the turnstiles started to clos4, at this
        point about 30 fans in the over 30 age group staggered, they had
        obviously consumed a lot of drink and started to shdut comments
        to the effect that if the turnstiles were not opened they would
        rip the gates off and nobody closed doors on Liverpool supporters.

     At this time I only had two officers outside the ground.   We calmed
     them down, checked their tickets and they entered by a turnstile.

     During the match I received a report that due to attempts to reach
     in and steal stock from the refreshment hut it hac been closed and
     fans in the North Stand round the hut were startir g to damage it.

     I requested fans to back off from the hut so that my officers could
     supervise an orderly purchase of refreshments and the hut would re-
     open.   Despite several requests there was no raov•etoent even though
     there were areas away from the hut.   I therefore used uniform
     officers who in the end had to bodily fight their way into the
     crowd to prevent fans banging and pulling at the %ooden end of the
     hut.   After a bitter struggle we managed to bodil y force them away
     and preserve a sterile area around the refreshment hut.      At no
     time did any of the fans assist in clearing the ar ea, they acting
     in a mindless way pushing towards the hut.

     For the rest of the match officers physically reta ined a small
     sterile area and supervised sales.

     Holdback after the Final Whistle

     It is the policy of the Humberside Force to allow home supporters to
     leave the ground and holdback the away supporters to prevent any
     confrontation on the car park or around the ground

     This was the case of this date, announcements were made over the
     public address system to this effect

    The holdback is achieved by a cordon of uniformed officers across the
    entranceway from the two areas.   After a short ti © I could see the
    fans at the back pushing the fans in front of then forward and
    pressure started to build up at the front.   Verb;>al requests were
    made to fans at the back to ease back and stop pu.staing, this was
    totally ignored and they just pushed all the more from the back.

    It was obvious to me that fans at the front were bjeing crushed and
    there was a danger of them being seriously injured along with police
    officers engaged on the holdback.

    I instructed my officers to ease back and allow tlhe fans to leave in
    an orderly manner.   As we started to move back a large cheer went
    up from the away supporters and a big surge forwa;rd broke through the
    cordon.   The fans then rushed out in an uncontro;11ed manner, best
    described as a herd of wild horses knocking their w n supporters out
    of the way.   My staff were unable to prevent this because of weight
    of numbers against us.

    At no time was any request by myself or my officerfe willingly 'ollowed
    and various degrees of force had to be employed to achieve our
    requests.

       "I was the officer in charge "of the policing uf the •Norwich isCifcy
   Football Club versus Liverpool football Club football match at Carrow
   Road, Norwich on-Saturday, 1st April, 1909.
         It is usual procedure to categorise football, matches as of high,
    medium or lot priority in our pre-season planning. Tills match had been
    categorised as high priority even before the result became of greater
    significance In the Division One Championship Competition,, The Carrow
    Road ground capacity ie 26,81,2 and for this reason it was also decided
    that the match would have to be all ticket, a fact which-would, be well
    publicised in advance.

         Carrow Road offers limited options for the accommodation of
    visiting supporters and the total available space, taking into account
    the need for segregation and accommodating home club members, is 5,000,

         There is terracing behind both goals at the football ground. The
    River End terracing is part of a 51% membership scheme and, therefore,
    always occupied by home fans, The Barclay Stand terracing is divided
    into 4 enclosures to limit lateral and forward movement an d segregate
    opposing factions. Hie pens are numbered 1 to 4, pens 1 and 2 are
    always occupied by home fans, pen 3 at medium and low priority matches
    remains empty and pen 4 is for visiting supporters. In addition there
    is another area of terracing, the Triangle, which faces obliquely across
    the pitch and is adjacent to pen 4 and seating in blocks F, G and E
    normally taken up by visiting supporters. Pens 3, 4, the Triangle and
    blocks F, G and M were allocated to Liverpool supporters for this match,
    4,800 tickets were sent to Liverpool for sale in advance.
         Access to the visitors enclosures is through turnstiles at the
   'rear of the Barclay Stand which are completely independent of the
    access points available for home supporters. The rear of the Barclay
    Stand borders the main A.47 Norwich to Great Yarmouth trunk road.

         Ifc-was obvious, owing to Liverpool's recent success that there
    would be a large, if not capacity, crowd for this match. Local interest
    was also very high and policing arrangements included the highest level
    of policing for any match during the season. This level was 313 officers
    including Special Constables.

         J 1 Thursday, 30th March, 1909, I saw the Norwich City Football
    Club Chairman, Mr. Robert CHASE, at the football ground. He told me
    that ticket sales for the match were not selling as well as expected in
    Liverpool. He had been told that 1,272 tickets would be returned and
    would be brought to Norwich on the club coach on Saturday. Mr. CHASE
               t^at P®n 3 now be allocated to home fans as pen 4, the Triangle
    and the seating coulu accommodate the reduced away support. I told him
    it would be imprudent to take that decision in the light of experience
    which showed that Liverpool always attracted considerable national
    support. The probability being that many people would attend who either
    could not obtain tickets because they were only on sale at Liverpool or
    unaware that the natch was in fact designated as all ticket. 1
    suggested that the decision be delayed until themorning of the match
    and I would then consider the situation with regard to pen 3, although
    because of access and egress to this enclosure for home fans it was
    most likely that the space would still be allocated to Liverpool
    supporters,

         On Saturday, 1st April, 1989, there was a significant crowd
    assembling outside the Carrow Road Football Ground by midday. Almost
    ail were Liverpool supporters and the majority had tickets. By 1300
    hours there was a considerable crowd gathered, a number of whom did not
    have tickets. Many said they were not aware it was an all ticket match
    at ot lers that they could not obtain tickets because they came from
    areas distant from Liverpool. I decided, therefore, to open 2
    turnstiles and sell the returned tickets, after agreement with the Club
    Chairman, to Liverpool supporters for access to pen 3. All the
                                 f®shlon and there is    doubt that some home
                                this way* They were, however, met by officers
    just inside the ground who directed them to accommodation reserved for
    IlrULnUpI>°5ter? ’ 1116 viBitltIS fans were quite well behaved and formed
    S er { and ^ et queues outside the ground. They did not arrive late

1 an a Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police, attached to Wembley Division.
    My duties include the policing of events at Wembley Stadium and                I have been doing
this in my present rank since January, 1987.

 The Hillsborough tragedy, after the initial stock, gave me tope for the future,
 ttds hope was that .the, behaviour .of fans., in-, typings; Lane, ,wMch.:l...recognise as -

On the 20 Hay 1 was in charge of the concourse at Wembley Stadium from the Royal
Tunnel round Westwards to Turnstile ’K ’. This area has two groups of turnstiles,
’P* and 'G*, which are approached by flights of steps and are relatively safe from
crushing.   It also has three groups of 'turnstiles, *Hf, ‘J 1 and ’K*, approached
by level ground and which are liable to crushing problems» .The stedium offices
are close to *H', 'J* and *K* and likewise on level ground.

1 saw the first Liverpol supporters on my way into Wembley at Stanmore Broadway,
seme six miles frcm the stadiim, where a nurriber were sitting on the pavement drinking
cans of beer or lager# at about 9,30 a.m.

Hie closer to Wembley, the more fans I saw who were drinking in the street, often
carrying more cans with then.
1 arrived at Wembley Stadium at about 10.30 a.m. and saw that alarge number of
fans were already on the ccnplex, perhaps as many as 10,000.Again, many   of than
had cans of drink, i.e. beer or lager with them. 1 was dismayed to find that many
of those present did not have tickets for the game. My advice to them to leave
the area went for the most part, unheeded.
On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile 'H' a small section of
fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
cant breach of the fence could be made, giving access to the circulating
corridoir.  From the enquiries I made it appeared that this hod been done
by fans during the nic£it, no doubt intending to apply pressure at the
right moment to gainjentry to the Stadium.

inforrration was passed to officers under my cormand by an unidentified
Liverpool police officer, that he had heard fans planning to rush the
'H', 'J* and 'K' turnstiles. This confirmed my own view that these were
the most vulnerable areas and therefore the most likely to be attacked.

As time progressed, I noticed that there were more people in that area
suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
This culminated in a nunfcer of fights at the 'pinch point', the narrowest
point of the concourse, outside the Stadium Offices.       The fights were
caused apparently by tlie uale of tickets by 'touts'. Although well known
touts were not evident! there seemed to be a number of people selling
one or tvro tickets.   The fans were keen to attack such people and yet
also to buy the tickets at inflated prices.

By 12.30pm, the crowd was building up generally, but especially so outside
turnstiles *H', 'J* and 'K'.     Because this area is confined, l had to
put in a cordon of police horses and foot police between the T.V. compound
and turnstile 'H' to prevent the danger of crushing.

Outside of the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder among fans
who had been drinking and I personally received a blow to the head whilst
assisting one of my officers in making an arrest.

Ihe tumst iles were late in opening because a lorry was still carrying
out some work in the circulat ing corridor. H'vis lorry could only make
an exit through a gate at the s i d e o f t u m s t i l e 'K'. it did this just
before 1.15pm but caused quite severe problems with crowds waiting for
the turnstiles to open.   The gate stuck when it was only half open and
a lot of effort was required to prevent a large nuirtoer of illegal entries
to the Stadiun.

Cnee the turnstiles opened, 1 expected the crowd to ease considerably
and to reduce the complaints of crushing I was getting frcm people in
the crowd.   That people were obviously pressing forward and causing a
crush in these circumstances, in the wake of Hillsborough, amazed me.
I was more amazed, however, to find_that the crush was not diminishing
as I expected •it to at turnstile 'H1. This was because of ticketless
fans forcing their way through the turnstiles with ticket-holders and
having to be removed through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the
operation.

Whilst a lot of illegal entrants were removed, I believe an appreciable
number were not. The most intense crush was at turnstile 'H1, which had
had a fence weakened during the night, and in my mind must have been pre­
planned by a large number of fans hoping to breach the security of the
fence, if they were unable to get in through the turnstiles.

By 2.30pm, the number of people going in through turnstiles 'H‘, 'J' and
'K' had reduced greatly.   This had been achieved by having tickets for
turnstile 'H' accepted at 'J ' and 'K* turnstiles and filtering people
at the cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
from them.    T5iey took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks and
other places, which node it difficult when production was demanded. The
nunfaer of street robberies for this event are much higher than far similar
events.
There were now earns 300 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
have firfcpt? bat were still anxious to find a way into the Stadium. Rather
'than leaving the <?orflon as a fixed target, I decided to ccrrcnence a sweep
Of       concourse,.pushing these fans towards the Royal Tunnel ana away
from the vulnerable area.

When the sweep from the other side, turnstiles JA' to 'E', reached the
Royal Tunnel, the crowd which numbered about* 500 began throwing bottles
and cans at police. A nurrber of arrests were made during the completion
of the sweep.
Despite the sweep, snail pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
during ti« progress of the game. At about half tine, there was a determined
attenpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windews at the Stadiun
Offices and turnstile *H’. This was successfully repelled.

Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadiun werecpenea
in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
and fans were starting to leave.     However, the equalising goal was then
scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
and a1cn those still around the ground without tickets. All managed to
get into bays around the Stadium to watch extra time.

 Ihe         of arrests, 76 on the outside of the stadiun, does not fully
 reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Father a balance
 is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
 the nunber of police left to control the crowd.
 Cn this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool.^ a n d E v e r t o n
 supporters.   Had this not been the case, I believe nuch greater disorder
 would have emanated from the section of fans determined to gain entrance
 to the Stadium, regardless of the cost in any terms, to others.

 Having describea a lot of bad behaviour on the P=rt
 say that the majority were well behaved and concerned for the safety of
 themselves and others.

                  went      down        to h e l p    he r    out.

                  We    opened          th e    pu b at      about    11.30am      (1130)          and      business         was    qui e t .

                  At    12 m i d d a y         (1200)      about     3 or 4 L i v e r p o o l          supporters          came     into          the

                  pub,      they        ordered       their     drinks      and    stood          by    the      bar,    talking         to me,

                  they      informed           me    that     they were Liverpool                  supporters            and    t h e y all            had

                  Liverpool             accents,        they were        dressed        casually            not     in the L i v e r p o o l

                  colours          although          I think       one w a s    wearing           a Liverpool            scarf.

                  Whilst       they were             in the     pu b t h e y w e r e        well       behaved        in g o o d    humour             and   1

                  could       be    described           as m e r r y a l t h o u g h    they were             not     drunk.

                  They were             polite       and     talked     to me     on a n u m b e r          of    occasions,            in
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    S53

between          serving          customers              from     the       conversation             I had w i t h        them       I

ascertained               that      they       had       travelled           on the          train    from Liverpool                 to

Sheffield           with         other        Liverpool           supporters             and    although           none       of    them

had     tickets           fo r    the     semi       final        match        it w as        their       intention           to    go    to

th e   Hillsborough                 ground          and     gain      entry        into       the    stadium.

They     even asked               me     to    go    to     the      ground with              them and        I said          that       they

would       no t    get      in w i t h o u t        a ticket,              but a l t h o u g h      I cannot        exactly

remember            how they            said that          they were               going       to    get in t h e y       said       it

would       be      e a s y as         they        had    done       it b e f o r e a n d       there were          other

Liverpool           fans         who     had       come     down with            them,        without        tickets          who were

going       to     ge t    in the         g r o u n d as wel l.

Also     in t h e         pub at         the       same     time      there        were       a small        group       of

Nottingham            Forest           fans        but    they       di d    not    have       any     conversation                with

myself       or     the L i v e r p o o l           fans     and      these        people        left      the     p u b at        about

1.30pm       ( 1 3 3 0 ).

At     about       1.45pm         (1345)           I was     asked          by the L i v e r p o o l         supporters             to

call     t h e m a taxi             to    take       them       to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h         football        stadium,

the     first       two      occasions              I tried          to     phone       for    a taxi        the    line was

engaged.            I eventually                   got    t h r o u g h at       about         1 . 5 5 p m (1355)        and       booked

a    taxi    for      them with a company                         called         C i t y Cars,            I think,       this       taxi

eventually            arrived            at    about        2.30       (1430)       to 2 . 4 5       (1445)        and    took       the

Liverpool           supporters                to    the     ground.

During       their         s t a y at         the    pub     I am unable                to    sa y   exactly        how much             they

consumed           in the w a y           of a l c o h o l i c        drinks,           but    they were           drinking

steadily           al l    the      time       they were             there.

The     group       of L i v e r p o o l           supporters             were     aged       in t h e i r    mid    twenties,

well     presented               in c a s u a l      dress.           I had        no    doubt       to    believe        that what

they     told       me a b o u t         not       having       tickets          was     not     true.

I left       the      pu b at a b o u t             4.30pm        (1630)         that        day and m ad e         my w ay         home.

The     M a t i l d a P.H.          is    situated about                    five miles           from      the H i l l s b o r o u g h

                  wife.

                  On Saturday                 15 A p r i l    1989      (1 5 0 4 8 9 )    I planned          to   play      golf    at    Concord

                  Golf       Course           in S h e f f i e l d ,    and    had a r r an ge d         to m e e t    some      friends        there

                  at     1pm      £1300).           The      course      is a b o u t      4 miles         from my         home,    and my

                  route        there          takes     me    past H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l        Ground.          Knowing        that

                  the       F A C u p Semi          Final       was     being      played       at     the    ground        on   that     day     I

                  set       off    early,          in c a s e    of     traffic          congestion          in the        vicinity,        leaving

                  home       about        11.45am         (1145),          I drove         alone        in m y    car,      and was

                  surprised             to     find     very     little        activity         near       the    g r o u n d as    I passed.

                 My      route         wa s    f r o m Mai in B r i d g e        along       Dykes       Lane     down W y n y a r d Road,

                  left       towards           Leppings         Lane     traffic          lights,        up H a l i f a x    Road    -    passing
                                                                                                                                                          !
                 along         Leppings           Lan e ,    and       past    th e      ground       e n t r a n c e at    that    point.            I
                                                                                                                           PAG E
                                                                                                                           S45

passed        there        about       11.50am       (1150)       and    saw very           few    football

supporters            and     traffic was            light.        I saw        that    the       Police       had       blocked

off    the     side        roads       to    protect       r e s i d e n t s ’ parking,           and      I saw,        I think,

about     50       policemen           in t h a t area.

Having        time        in h a n d    before meeting             my    friends,           I s t o p p e d at       the

"Si cey"           on S i c e y A v e n u e    to     pass t i m e       until        I met      t h em.      I went        into

the    pu b        and ord ere d a half              pint    of    lager,        and    sat       down      in th e       bar

loung.

I sa t     just       to    the      right     of    the m a i n    entrance.               There       were

approximately               fifteen          people     in the      pub.         The    room has            ’bays*        around

its    circumference                 and     I sat at       the    end     of    one    of      the     'bays*       nearest

-the e n t r a n c e ,      w i t h my       back    to the       next     ’bay *.          Sitting         b e h i n d me w e r e

three     men,        who w ere a l r e a d y         there       when     I arrived.

After     a        few minutes I became                aware       of    their     conversation.                    I ca n n o t

now    remember            the    exact       words,       but    I gathered           first       of a l l       that      they

were     football           supporters,             intending       to     go    to    the      semi-final           at

Hillsborough.

As    I went         to    sit    down       I had    noticed       that        these       three       men    were       as

follows
    *
1.  Mid        thirties,             black     or d a r k    brown       hair,        cut    slightly          longer           than

normal,        with a dark              moustache.           He    was     wearing          black       leather          hi p

length        coat,        dark      trousers.

2.     Mid twenties,                 light     sandy       hair,    cut     very short,               but     not    a    crew

cut,     clean        s ha v e n ,     wearing       red s w e a t e r ,    crew       n e ck     and a       pink       shirt

collar        worn        outside,          light    grey    trousers.

3.     Mid     twenties,             hair     light     brown and          cut    ear       l e n g t h,    wearing.a

tweed      sports          jacket.           1 cannot       describe        t h i s m a n as w e l l           as    the

others        as     he    sat    farthest          away    f r o m me.

As    I listened            to    this       conversation,          I heard           this      older       man     (no.        1)

talking        to     the     others,        saying        that    they     should          not w o r r y      about       not
                                                                        "                                                            P AGE
                                                                                                                                     S45

having       tickets.              T he y would meet                  up w i t h       "the       others"          outside

Leppings          Lane       entrance.              They would              organise             as m a n y     people         as

possible          to    cause       whatever             trouble         they         could.           If e n o u g h     trouble           was

caused       the       gates       would        have      to be o p e n e d .               I gathered             that     this       had

happened          before,          and      this m a n       seemed          confident              t h at    t h is     action        could

be    forced.

The    sandy       haired man               (no.     2)    asked         how      th e      "others"          would       know       to

meet     up at         the    right         time.        (No.     1) T h e        other          man     said      if    they       got

there       f or a b o u t        2.15pm        (1415)       he k n e w m o s t             of    th e      other       lads a n d        they

could       quickly          be    got      organised.             He       said       "We've          got    t<? ge t      as      close

to    the    turnstiles             as      possible."             He       said when             the       gate    was     opened,

they would             force       their       way       through        to       "the       back       of    the    goal".

At    this       point       one     of     the     three men           noticed             I was        listening,            and     they

gl a re d at       me        in a n       u n f r i e n d l y way. I h u r r i e d l y            drank            the    remainder

of m y d r i n k        and       left      th e    pub.        The         time      would        then      be a b o u t      12.20pm

(1220 ).

I wa s      in    the        pub    for a b o u t         te n          to       f i f t e e n minu te s.I was a bl e                  to    see

these       men    as        I walked          from       the           bar to m y           seat,       a n d as I s t o o d        up     to

leave.
    *
I know       that       these       men were             Liverpool           supporters                because          nos.     2 and 3

had Liverpool                accents.              No.    1 had a n E ast                Midlands/Nottinghamshire

accident.              They       spoke       of    the L e p p i n g s          Lane       end a r r a n g em e nt s          as    though

they were          well       aware         that     t h is w a s       their          t e a m ’s e n d of t h e            ground.

I did       not    place          too m u c h       importance              on    the       conversation                I had heard,

and went          to    play golf.                 On my w ay          home       in the          car       I heard       on     the

radio       that       there       had      been an        incident              at    t he      semi-final,             and

thereafter             the    conversation                became        more          significant             to me.           The

course       of    the       public         hearings         of   the        enquiry             currently          being
                                                                                                                                                  i
conducted          by J u s t i c e        Taylor,         prompted me                 to     tell       this      to    the Police .

I must       say       that       I gained          the    impression                 that       the P o l i c e        were     being
I                                                                                                                       P AGE
                                                                                                                        S45

                unfairly       blamed        for    this    course      of e v e n t s .

                On    the    day a f t e r    the    Hillsborough          tragedy,        I discussed with          a golfing
I               friend,                        L w h a t I h a d h e a r d in the pu b on the p r e v i o u s day.

I               He    suggested       I tell        th e P o l i c e   about    it,    but   I did   not   do   so

                 immediately.

I                                                                                                     G.   TAYLOR      SIGNED

these        remarks         he    w as   holding          his      penis         and     shouting             ’B u c k       xhis       yo u

continue.              I remember           thinking            how     each        person          1 spoke            to a b o u t         their

not     want        to be       arrested          prior       to      the      g am e     starting.                  The d r u n k e n

from        the        ground             by     other             o fficers.

At    th is        tim e         there           were          several                 hundred         people             hanging          around          the

the       ground            were          asked           to       move       from            that    area           to     allow      fans          in.

Several            people             who        had       entered                the         ground         complained               that       people          at

At    th is        I    looked             through                 the       tu rn stiles              towards              Leppings            Lane,

Around           2.40       pm I       saw          that       several         fans          had       again      clim bed            the          outer

By     now       many       fans       had          congregated               around          the       tu rn stiles                and       several

being        abusive             towards             us       because         they        had      been        subjected              to       the

roof     who          in    turn       began             to    throw         them       over       the        w all    to       fans          aw aiting

I t    had       now       got    to     the         stage          where      searching                was      im possible                  due     to

the     amount             of    fans       congregating                     inside          the       tu rn s tile         area          and

I     formed          the       opinion             that       before         too       long       a    Police         o ffic e r             would        be

p h ysically               assaulted,                and       due     to     the       fact       that        only        serial             14    was

deployed              in    that       area,             had     an    o fficer           been         assaulted            then

assistance                 would       have          been        very        lim ited         and       the     situ atio n               got       out

Fans     were        s t il l        congregating                   round          the        area        inside          the       turnstiles                 and

I    made     several               request          for       them       to       move        away        to    allow           people          to       get

through         the       tu rn stiles               as    this          in    its e lf            was     creating             a     problem             for

entering         H       at     a     cime      but        was       unable             to    prevent            t h i s due          to       the    number

of     fans     around           the       tu rn stiles.                  These              people        just        disappeared                    into

the     crowd.

S hortly        before           3.00pm           ('1500)           the       main           exit    gate        situated                 near       to

several         o ffic ers            from       the       serial             ran       towards            the       gate       and        I    joined

them     in     an       e ffo rt      to       close          the       gate       (I       was     of     the       opinion              that       the

gate     had     been          forced        open          by       fans)           but        this       was        im possible.

As    the     fans        surged           into        the         ground,          many           chanting           as      they         ran,       I

that     area        w ith       other       officers                and       found           that       people           were        on       the       flo o r

having        tripped           or     been          pushed          over          in    the        rush        to    get       into           the

to    the     side        w alls       away          from       the       rush.              Not     one        person          complained                 to

Eventually            the       gsles        were          closed,             s o me        fans' were              s till         coming           through

people           over     the          fence.               I went          over       to    the        perim eter               fence          covering

the     central           south                enclosure              and     saw      that       people              had       been       crushed

way     and       afford           greater                entry         into      the       enclosure.                     The       fence       did          not

give        way     and       1    climbed                down        onto       the    track.               I    could          see       PS    1341

avoid        any     person             fa ilin g        over          it.         By    now    many         injured             and       dead       had

been      removed             from        the      enclosure                and     were       being         attended                to    by    St.

John      Ambulance                brigade,             s o me        fans       had     torn       d o wn     advertising                  boardings

and    were         using          these          as    make          sh ift       stretchers             to      remove             people          from

tne     pitch.

I    then      saw       Chief          Superintendent                      Nesbit        near       the       emergency                  exit       gate,

I    formed         one       of       the    lines          and       assisted           in    the       evacuation,                     handling

many      bodies             none       of    which          I    can       describe.

A fte r      a il    the          injured          and       dead          had     been     removed            from         the       enclosures

from      our       s erial,            we    were       instructed                 by    PS    Crawford               to       remain          at    that

from      the       se rial.

Several           fans        were        going         round          and       shaking        o fficers              hands,             thanking

them      for       what          they       had       done.

A    message         was          then       pst.sed         over          the     public:      address            sy s t e m         by    police

                            Evidence concerning events of Saturday 15th April 19&9




            On the day in question I paraded for duty at E c d e s f i e l d Police station               ...
            at 0900 hours* I was then transported by Bus to Hillsborough football
            ground where upon arrival I confirmed that I was be part of serial bS
            patrolling the Foxhill area of Sheffield in a Transit van, Tango 4.


            Itself and other meabers of this seriil took our seats in the North Stand
            for the breifing by senior and intelligence officers before collecting our

            meals and caaencing patrol at approximately 10.50 hours*


            Our first port of call was Che F ox public house situated on Foxhill Road.
I           This is a fairly large pub with a very large tarmacadam carpark and grassed
            area opening onto the above road. At about 11.05 hours myself and Inspector
            Robinson visited the Landlord in the Lounge Bar of the premises. He stated
             that he had five extra staff on duty and had retained the services of ”a big
            lad" as doorman. He also said that he had extra beer and lager on and that he
            would be welcoming Liverpool supporters. At this time there were a few locals
             drinking in the pub and about two "famil ies11 of Liverpool supporters with
             young children. These supporters were quietly m inding their own business .
             The manager was advised that we would be patrolling the area and calling by
             regularly and that we should be contacted in the event of any need for assistance.


           - We then resumed patrol , checking'visually other pubs in the area. Host were
             either quiet      cloaed. However during this time many supporters began to flood

             into the side streets' in this area and park their private cars and vans.


             At 31.30.hrs we again checked The Fox public house. It was staling to fill up
             with crowds of LTC fans standing outside drinking in the sunshine. The surrounding
             streets in Foxhill and uptowards Grenoside were now very busy with the vehicles
             of arriving fans ; to the extent that it made maneuvering of our shortwheelbase
             transit van very difficult. We then observed that traffic         flowing freely cown
             Halifax Road from the North with many supporterr        arriving in private cars, vans
             and hire minibuses. These vehicles were turning off into the Foxhill and Parson

             Cross estates; presumably to park.


             At 12.10 we again doring our patrols checked The Fox pub. The car park was now
                                                                   '                 cont/-


                                                                 v    I
full to capacity with people standing very close to each other, sitting
on cars and standing on the boundary vail ; all drinking alcohml.


At 12.30 v e were directed by control to attend at Wilcox Road, Foxhill
where youths were reported to be acting disorderly manner and urinating
in peoples front gardens* At the scene we liaised with PCs stationed at
the bottom of the road who stated that 5~6 liverpool fans had passed them
being abusive and throwing down beer cans# Some of this team were observed
to go up Vile ax Rd and urinate in gardens. We saw this group of youths
walking up that road and stopped and .spoke to them. A l l had been drinking
heavily and were i n ajvery boisterousmood. They:;wereadvised and: pointed          -
in the direction of the ground* We followed thea down the h i l l a n d near .the
bottom they all boarded a SYPTE bus bound for the town centre*


At 12,50 we again visually checked the Fox pubilc house* By now the car park
was bursting to capacity and fans stood drinking same distance up and down
Foxhill Road on the Pavement on both sides drinking alcohol purchased from
The Fox. I would estimate the number in the car park and walls alone to
be in the region of ^.bout 300 to kOO, With a further 20CX standing on the
pavement and .pull:'in on. the opposite pavement.   There was i n there number
a large drunken, rowdy contingent who cat called as we passed and who          ..
continued to do so when we paused for observations,


At 1300 hours we checked the White HORSE public house on Halifax/Southey green
Road. This, too, was full of LFC supporters and the scene was very similar to

that at The Fox*   ...........                                          „


At 13*05 hours we receive a message from control to attend at                , a
newsagent,tobacconist and confectionary shop opposite the Fox pub. The
manegeress stated that six drunken LFC fans had come into her shop and
acted disorderly before stealing cigarettes and sweets. She followed them
outside where they were very abusive and threatening said saw them drive off

in a White * Renault van registered number


At “5.15 hrs I saw the van being driven on Halifax Road. We followed to the
car park of The White Horse pub where it parked up. After a short conversation
the six occupants of the van were arrested by me and placed in our police
van. They were then transported to EPS arriving at 13.^0 hours#
                                                                    cant/-

 The prisoners were a n   Liverpool supporters ranging in age from 18 j r s      to
 37 years. They had all been drinking both in the van on the way over and
 at The Fox public house. They stated that they had arrived in plenty of
 time at about 12.15 hours. When booking the prisoners property in it was

 found that not all of then had tickets far the natch.



It was ascertained that all six had attended Sheffield for the match with only
TWO West stand ticket between them. They had managed to swap one of these
tickets for TWO lepping lane terrace tickets; brining the total held to THEEE
between SIX.'The prisoners told me that they had heard that tickets would be

on sale from touts at the ground and that last year the officials at the ground
had let some in without checking tickets owing to the rush because of the
match starting. It .was farther noted when booking in property that there was
very little cash between them. And certainly some of those without match tickets
did not have sufficent funds -to purchase tickets at TCXJTS prices;' indeed they

only had loose change.


This was noted at the time and subject of discussion between myself and the

custody officer. Obviously the full significance of this information did not
become apparent until later* but the custody records corroborating this
evidence re property are availible for examination at Ecclesfield _police station.
It appeared to me at the time that if these prisoners had insuficient funds             to
buy tickets and that they ■ ere determined to get into see the match ( this was
more than apparen by the noise and ^complaints comning from the cells when they
were detained) then they were going to attempt to gain enrty by some means. This
is again corroborated by the fact that they had turned u p on spec without money
but with the knowledge that people had some how gained enrty at the last minute last

year because of the rush.


The prisoners were all held whilst      I liaised with C2D regarding their interview.
At about 15.15 hours I was in the CID office when PC 12^2 Armitage called me
and told me that OPERATION SDPP03T was required at the ground. My transit had
departed earlier so I was driven in a police car to the ground in co PC 12^2
Arnitage, PS 2269 Strafford and Inspector Hudson. We arrived at the Leppings
lane end at about 15*30 hours. We parked the car in a side street and all headed
towards the t u m s i l e s . Fans were pouring out of the ground some confused, some

angry and others obviously distressed by s o m e t h i n g . _______________ —   + /_
As I approached the gate in front of the turnstiles, a few paces behind
Inspector Hudson, I saw a LFC fan attack him and try to punch him.           Hudson
managed to restrain the youth     who was upset and crying,      I assisted     him and
pulled the youth off and took     him away from the scene. During the struggle
I received an injury to     my right foot; it was not serious and the bruise
only lasted a few days.      I tried to calm him down but he kept shouting
"There is fucking dead bodies     in there".    I released the youth   to the
custody of friends and returned to the main         gates.


I had NO personal radio so I was unaware of the circumstances of the
incident however I assumed there had been some sort of crush, perhaps a wall
collapse^    A mass of people were pouring out of the gates at Leppings Lane.
Most of them did not know what had happened either and seemed mostly
concerned with the Fact that they had not gained entry or wished to know if
the match was abandoned.                       ';


However quite a few of their number informed me that some supporters had
been crushed because of a massive surge Or that a        gate had been opened by
the police or stewards.      Iwas on my own now so I tried to move fans out of
the path of oncoming emergency vehicles; the progress of which they were
hampering.    I sensed that something very disasterous had happened from the
mood and tears of fans.     I continued to try to clear the roadway but the
mood of some fans was very aggressive fuelled by the fact that they were
heavily under the influence of intoxicants.         I was jostled and abused by
these drunken fans    and whilst attempting tomove a large congregation from
the path of a fire engine, I was punched on the right shoulder by an unknown
assailant and.jeered and insulted by the rest of the group~         Some still had
beer cans in their hands.


The situation had become potentially very violent with all the violence and
abuse apparently directed at the police.       I was still in the dark about the
incident or requirements as I was on my own without-'a personal radio.          After
the task of keeping fans off the road became fruitless and dangerous to my
personal safety, I looked further down Leppings Lane and saw my serial in
their transit van.     PS 2 2 0 7 Shaw saw me and got me back into the van.
Crowds of LFC fansjeered and rocked the van as they passed.        Several     police
motorcyclists parked across from us became very vulnerable to attack by fans
and after a few close calls had to move on.         The fans shouted "Murderers" to
us and other officers as they walked by.


The Sgt in the van had a personal radio but the reception and communication
was very bad.   Inspector Robinson got out of the van to go to police control
                                                                   -5-

moving           towards             the        ground.              By        this     time          vehicular               tra ffic             had       ceased

and     the           en tire        carriageway                    was        blocked          by        people.

W hilst          stood          w it-h      DCs        Hallam            and     L ille y            and        looking        down           into          the

w alking              towards            th e     g ro u n d ,       I    saw        groups           of     young           men     p u s h in g , i n t o              -

 the     crowd,           the        m ajority               of     these        b e in g       th e        worse        for       d r i n k , I            saw

 several              carrying             and      drinking               from        large          2     litre        bottles              of        both


 lager        and        beer.

 At    this           tim e     I     noted         that           the    Police           horses               were     moving           amongst                 the

 My     im pression                 of     the      situation                  was     that          the        crowd        was     becoming

 desperate               due        to     h a v in g         no    tickets            and       w ith          no    hope      of       getting

 start           of    the      gam e        due        to     large           amount           of     people           trying           to    gain           entry

    way.

    I        spoke        to    several                  fans               saying                    ’ Don’ t       go        forward,              stay     back’ .             M any

the     turnstiles.                  Many    o l der          people          were        passing               me    and        stating         that

 they       had    no     intention          of         trying          to    get     in       through               the L e p p i n g s         Lane

 uncomfortable.                  All       these         persons             appeared            to     have          tickets             for    the

volume        of     persons          running            from          what    appeared                to       be    other         entrances              to

     wish       1 never            had     contact         with again.               1 felt        as       a Policeman              a sense

     of    disappointment                    in     the    fact       that     1 had       not     g o ne      into        the      ground       to

 From        quite       early       in      the      d a y , large              queues          had    formed          at     both       shops.

 were        walking       along            and      carrying              cans       of    beer.         I saw         one        youth

 i saw        no a n i m o s i t y          from      them         towards            either       the       Police          or     fellow

 s u p po rt e rs .

 i was, a p p r o a c h e d • b y            several            persons           from       about       2    prn a s k i n g        where

 unere        were       some       public          t o i l e ts .         1 did           not    know       of       any and        tola      them

tnat        as     far    as    1 knew            the       only      toilets           were       inside             the    ground.           All

said        that      it w a s      too      early            to     go    in,    obviously              because             it w o u l d      stop

them        from      cringing.                  I was        also a p p r o a c h e d            by    several             obvious

Liverpudlians                  asking        where            the     ticket          touts        were       as      they        had    not    got

tickets.              Only      on e     admitted               to    travelling                 without          a   ticket,           the

others           said    t h ei r      tickets              had      been    stolen.

     a     lot     of    cans       of      beer.

     A     snort        time       after             I first          noticed           the     congestion,                  I saw      t ha t     it was

     beginning                 to clear.              I was       not      aware          of    the        reasons           why    it w a s

     the      crowd and             being             constantly              in    conversation                  with        someone,           it w a s

     easy        to m i s s        what          was       bei n g     said.

     It     seemed            to me         th a t the          congestion              cleared            some     minutes            before           the        t

 at    this    time.             There        were       o v er     a hundred           people         in L e p p i n g s            Lane       who

hurling       abuse          at    him a bout          the      situation.

supporters          urinating                in g e n n e l s       between         the    terraced          houses           and       also

going       into    those          back       gardens          looking         to    gain       entry       to     the    ground          via

the    perimeter             fences          abating       tne       gardens         and       the    ground.            I went          on

to    the    Penistone             Road       e n t ra n t e    and      in    startling             c o n trast        there       were

no    queues       at    any       of    tne       turnstiles            and     ay a b o u t        3 . 0 3 pm    1 haa       gained

access       to    the       terracing.               I sa w        play      stopped          a n d at     first        thought

there       had    been       a pitch           invasion.

As    tne    situation             deteriorated                I decided            that       the    match        would       not

continue,          but       not    grasping           the      full       extent         of    it    I walked           home

presuming          it w o u l d         be    sorted       out      by     the      officers          deployed,,              On

arrival       home       1 heard             the    call       on    radio       for      off    d ut y     officers           to

attend       Hammerton             Road       Police       Station            and    1 went          there        by    car    arriving

at    approximately                4.0Dpm.

I have       attended             such       games     in the         past,         on    numerous          occasions              both       on

and    off    duty       but       I have          never       seen      such       hostile          and    aggressive

behaviour          by    football             supporters.

By    2.00        pm the        pavements                 and      r o ads     were      congested with                  fans       90     were

carrying           alcohol.

Fans        were       asking        fo r      spare          tickets          and    complaining                that     unlike          last

expecting              to    buy     tickets.

The     crowds          were        heavier             and     heavier         and      the    hill        wa s    a total           mass      of

Leppings           Lane        Stand.              I heard          it    said       that      the V e r e         Road       Off     Licence

had     shut       down        due       to    no       stock       left.

A     few    fans       ha d    been          asking          where       the      Beehive          and     another           pu b was         as

they        knew       the     landlord             and were             meeting         there.

3.00        pm as       the     game          started           fans      were       still      pouring            down       the     hill      a nd

running           along        the       roa d s .

People           were       asking        to       pass       our     barrier         and      so 2 d o z e n         old and young

people           were       allowed           down        the      centre       of    the      road.         People           were       still

PC     Stubfains            then     j o i n e d .'us a n d           s a id    to    fans      that        there        w as    no      poi n t

People           were       coming        out       of       the    ground         stating          it w a s       chaos        and      that

people           were       sitting           in    the i r seats              (apparently with                    'tickets).

The     crowd          in the        ground             were       ’roar in g *       constantly             and      still         there

I was        aware          of a     large          Police          gathering            at    the     end       of F i e l d i n g       Road/

Leppings           Lane        but       1 was          unaware          what      was     happening.               People          were

coming           out    saying           its       terrible           in th e r e        'people          ar e     dying'1.           Heard

officers           what        we    should             do    about       the      barrier          and     they      just       told      us       to

hang        on    there.

A     rumour       began        that          the       match       was      off     and      the    pitch         had    been        invaded

       was       decided           that          S73E would             stay with          the    barrier          and    I would          go    into

       Ine sround to assist.

       North          Stand        and       the    S p i o n Hop.

       1 was          directed              to    join       a    line       of    officers       across        the      centre       of the

       the       majority              of    fans       seemed          to    be    dazed       but    there       was    the     occasion

       when       I saw           fans       shouting             at    officers          and    pointing          at    them,       but    oth e r

       fans       tried           to    calm       them          down and          lead    t h e m a w ay.

       The       fans        in the          West       S t an d were             pointing       and     chanting         and     people         were

       climbing              from       the       stand          into    the       terrace.

       The       fans        behind          us    were          fairly       quiet       and    seemed       to     sense      that

       something              wa s      amiss.

       A    scuffle           began          in    the       area       below       the    Police        c o n t r o l .box a n d as we

       ordered           back          by one       Senior             Officer       in f r o n t      of    the     line.

       Standing              on    the       line,       the       ground appeared                to     be a b s o l u t e l y      packed and

       We       were     then          directed          to       leave       the    ground       and       deal     with      crowds

       leaving           the       ground.

       There          wa s    no       trouble          with       crowds          after    the       m a t c h at      the    junction          of

            At    about        9.40     a.m.    we    arrived          at Hi 11 s h e r o u g h        football       ground,        where

            we    were     deployed           into    the       North,Stand              for   briefing.          We w e r e       then

given        a    packed          1unch w h i c h we                consumed w h i l s t               in    the    stand.




At     11.15       a.m.          we    took    up out           positions             at       the     roundabout          at    the

junction           with          Lappings           Lane       and Peni stone                  Rosa     North,          outside       tne O i g

Close        to    the       ground          it w a s      fairly          quiet          to    b e g in with,           but    as    lunch

time     approached                   more    and        more       fans     came         to    tne     ground.           I was

approached              by a n u m b e r            of    fans       during          this       time        who    were    ail       looking

for     tickets             to    buy.        In S e r i a l         30,     there         were        two       people    who       had

personal           r a d ios,          the    Serial           Sergeant,             Police           Sergeant          Ashton       had     one

allocated              to    h i m at        th e    ground and Police                         Constable           £43 Landers,              who

is a C o m m u n i t y            Constable,              had       his w i t h       him.            Police       Constable          Landers

was     on duty               only       feet       away        f r o m me w h e n I h e a r d a m e s s a g e                 come     aver

the     radio          that       there       was        trouble        at    the          Royal        Public House            whicn        is

near     to       tne       ground       at     tne       Nottingham             forest           End.




From     where          I w as         positioned              I c ould       see         up    from        the    roundabout           up    tne

road     towards             the       railway           station where                the       Liverpool           supporters             were

arriving.               There          was    fay no w a c o n s t a n t              stream           of    supporters          walking

from     this          direction             down        towards        the      ground.               At    a    point    about

halfway           up    the       hill       I could           see    that       a    l a rge         number       of    poeple       were

standing           in            the    street           outside       a public house.                      I do not       know       the

name     of       it,            but    I also           saw    that       ail     the c o a c h e s t h a t w e r e           arriving

were     being          directed             to a        parking        area         near       to     this       pub.




At     about       2.00          p.m.    the        flow       of    supporters                wa s    becoming          more    and       more

on     the       edge       of    the    forecourt              of    the     Service             Station.              I became        aware
of    a group          of    about           12 to         15 L i v e r p o o l              supporters                who    were       beginning

to    argue'with             £       Nottingham             Forest                fans.           I    approached             the       group        ana

told       both    parties                to m o v e       on.           Although             the          atmosphere             between          the

ri val      tans       was       hostile,             there             was       no    trouble             and    everyone             else       had

moved       away.           Police          Constable                   Landers          and          Police       Constable             Kitson          at

this       time    had       gone          i ns i d e      the          service          station             to    try a n d           sort       out    a

vehicle          which       had          been       parked             on    the       forecouri                without          permission.




Throughout             the       lat e r        part       of       the       morning             I    saw a number                of    fans

walking          about       carrying                cans       of       alcohol             and       I    indeed       informed                several

of    them       that       there          was       a good             chance          they would                not    be a l l o w e d          into

the    ground          if    they were                drunk.                 As    the       time          got    nearer          to    the       kick

off    time       1 saw          fans        drinking               from          cans       of       beer       one    after          the       other,

as    if    to    be    trying             to    drink          t h e m all,             so       they       d i d n ’t h a v e         to       leave

them       outside          the       ground when                   they went                in.           There       were       still          fans

enquiring          about             spare       tickets                at    this       time.




At    about       2.50       p.m.          1 noted and                   indeed           commented               to P o l i c e        Constable

towards          the    ground.                 At    one       point             there       were          so m a n y       that       not       all    of
     *
them       could       walk          on    the       pavement                and       they       ha d      to    spill       onto       the       road.




At    about       2.00       p.m.          the       Serial             gathered             on       the    corner          of    the       junction

Leppings          Lane       and Penistone                      Road.              We    were          going       to    go       into       Phase       two

of    our    duties          w hic h was              to    be          on    s t a n d b y , but            we    heard          over       a    r a dio

that       there       was       a    p r o b l e m at          the          turnstiles                at    the L e p p i n g s         Lane       End.




Over       the    radio          1 could             hear       a       lot       of    supporters                singing         ana        a Police

Officer's          voice             w h i c h was         saying             that       a    lar g e        number          of    fans          were

outside          the    ground             pushing          against                one       of       the    gates..          I    then          heard

the     gates              was becoming d a m a g e d .                   1    then      heard        that       it w a s       going         to be

necessary             to     open        the    gate       in     order         to     relieve           the     pressure            at     the

front.          I then         heard          the    order        tc      open        the     gate,




After       a    few       seconds            I heard       that          all    available               officers          were        to

attend          on    the      track          around       the       side       of     the     pitch,          at    which        we       started

to    make       our       way      to    the       Lsppings             Lane    End.          I never           neara       anything

An    ambulance              then a r r i v e d         ana       stopped             just     inside          the     gate.           1    then

walked          past       the      ambulance,             I could             see     the     youth        inside,          he      looked

pushing          a Policeman               about        and     shouting,            "IT'S YOUR              FUCKING FA U L T “ .

As    we    neared          to the         tu n n e l      which      leads        onto         the    terracing                other     fans

As    1 entered, onto                the        terracing            1 saw       that      there           was    several          hundred

people          milling        about        on       the     pitch,           I then made              my way          onto       the     pitch

via      on e    of    the     perimeter              fence        gates,        I think          it was          number          M.      I

then       saw    people         lying          on    the     grass        near      to    the        goal.           As    1 entered

over       the    top- of        the       fence.            Although          1 could           reach       the       hands       of     the

behind        the     goal          to     the     left        as     you      stood     on    the       pitch       looking         at    tne

under     the        top       of     the        fence.

room.         I then           went        back        to     the     hole      in the        fence       where       I assisted            to

carry     another              male        youth        on     to     the      pitch.         He    was       passed     to me        by

fans     from        the       terracing.                   The     y o u th was        motionless,             but     very     warm       and

was     Jblueish          in       c o l our.          On     finding          a space        to    lay       nim    down myself            and

another         Police             officer         started            to t r y     and    revive          him.        I searched            for

a    pulse      but       could           not     find        one.        He    appeared           to    be    dead .       Someone

then     came        and       took        over        from        us.      I think       it w a s        an a m b u l a n c e       man.         1

was     then asked                 by a w o m a n           Police        Constable           to    try and          find      some

oxygen        for     a    person            she       wa s    resuscitating,                 so    I found          a medical

person        who was              going         around.            All     the    time       I could          see    people,         fans

and     oTfleers           ali k e ,         trying           to    resuscitte           people,          some       injured         pe o p l e

who     began        to    breathe               again,        were       being        sick,       others       were     just        being

covered         up    by       clothing            because            there       was    no m o r e       to    be    d o ne    for       them.




All     the     time       people           were        running           about        shouting          and    c r y ing,     trying           to

find     persons           they           ha d    lost.            I was       then approac hed                by a m a n      who        had

1ost     h is    youn g            s on    so     1 told           h im w h e r e t h e i n j u r e d          would     be    ta k e n

and     pointed           out       wnere         to    go     in o r d e r       to    find       out    more       information.                 i

then     saw     that          a    large         part        of    the     Liverpool          supporters             began      to       surge

towards         the       Nottingham               Forest           supporters           who       had    been       taunting         th,em,

so    I went         to    the        centre           of     the     pitch       where       1 me t      other       members         from

  Serial     30,       We    then     formed a           line a c r o s s          the     pitch       and      stopped any

  further        Liverpool          fans       from     going       towards         the     kop.        We      stayed        in the

  centre     of    th e     pitch     until          about     5,15       p.m.      w h en,      in    company with

  Police     Sergeant            Ashton,        we     returned         to    the       roundauout           on P e n i s t o n e

  Road     North.




  Whilst     in t h e       centre        of    the     pitch       I saw        several         scuffles           broke      out

  between        the    f an s    in the        seated        area      and      I saw P ol ic e            Officers

  removing        persons         from     the       seated        areas      to    prevent           any    further

  trouble.         Once      outside           the     ground       I never         saw a n y         further        trouDle         an

  At     about    6.E0           p.m. in our      Serial,          we   went       to    the     Road       Traffic

  Department           building       near        to    the    ground         where        we    were       given

  refreshments .



  At     about    7.10      p.m.     we    received           information             to    stand       down        so   we

  returned        to   our       Transit        van and        returned            to D o n c a s t e r      arriving

  at     Edlington        Police      Station           at a b o u t      7.50      p.m.         At    S . 00   p.m.       I went

               On      Saturday           15 A p r i l      1 969      I commenced              d u t y at     9.00am         at    E c c i e s f ieid

                th e      Hillsborough             Football           Ground,        where a           full     briefing            subsequently

                took       place.

                I was        detailed         to S e r i a l         19 t o g e t h e r     with PS 323              Proctor            and    ten

               ether         constables.                Our     duties        were     initially              outside         the       ground,       at

               the        Leppings          Lane    entrances,              supervising               arriving         Liverpool

                public          order       duties.            This       duty was         in f a c t     the       s am e    as    I and       many       of

               officers              present,       were        well      aware      of w h a t        wa s    required.

                I arrived             with my       serial           at    the L e p p i n g s        Lane     end     of     the       g r o u n d at

               briefed           us on       our    particular              du t i e s .        We    then went         out        into       Leppings

               Lane        and       took    up    positions              in the     ’m o u t h ’ of          the    entry         to    the    ground

               On      r e a c h i n g 'L e p p i n g s    Lane       I immediately                  noticed        that      there       were

               already           a large          number        of L i v e r p o o l       supporters           in the         area,          some

               walking           around,          some     stood around              in s m a l l       groups.              The    turnstiles

were     not       open          at    this       point.            From     the     outset,           1 had       cause         to    converse

with     many          supporters,                ail      of w h o m at        this       time were              very amicable.                     I

wa s    corit i nual iy a p p r o a c h e d                  by     supporters            wh o    had arri ved             early           and      who

were     asking             one       of    a    limited          number       of    question,              namely       - Where            was

the     nearest             pub       or    beer-off?               inhere     could       they        get       something            to    eat?

Where        a    particular                entrance           to    the     ground        was?        Did       I know where                •i v

tickets           could          be    bought?

All     the       supporters                were      in g o o d      humour,         and were              dealt       with

accordingly.                     They       continued             to w a l k    around           or    gather        in g r o u p s ,        the

numbers           buiiaing             steadily            all      the    time.          More        and more          f a ns    arrived

and     it       soon       became          noticeable              that     many     ha d       been       drinking,            many       were

in f a c t        walking             around        near       to m y      location          carrying             several         cans       or

bottles           of    bee r,         and       openly        drinking         from       them,,           On    ' n o r m al ' m a t c h

days     1 am          certain             this     in     itself         would      not     have          been    tolerated               by my

serial,           but       the       point       was      reached         where      there were                 simply     too m a n y             of

them     acting             in t h i s          manner.           There      was     the     occasional              loud m o u t h          who.

appeared           worse          for       dr i n k ,     but      again      as    time        went       on,    these         became          more

and more           noticeable.

I cannot           recall             the       exact      time      that      the    turnstiles                 were    opened,            but      I

can     rt?cali         that          when       t h e y w e re,      there         was    no a p p a r e n t        rusn        by    the

supporters              in the             area     to     get      into     the     ground.               They    were     stood about

in g r o u p s         of    increasing              size,          and    then      they        began       taking        up     positions

on     nearby          walls,          sitting           and      drinking          beer     etc.           There       were      many

people           who    had       obviously arrived                       without         tickets,           they were            openly

approaching                 other          people        and a sk i ng         to    buy     tickets.              These         people

were     in       fact       a    continual              n u i s a n c e -, a n d    were        being       repeatedly' a s k e d                to

move     away          from       the       entrance           to    the     turnstiles.

As     time       went       on       it    became        increasingly               difficult             for all        officers,

even     the       Mounted             officers,            to m a i n t a i n       good        order       in the       Leppings.                      *

Lane     area.              The       crowds       were        too    plentiful            and        as   the     day w e n t        on     they
.eemed             less        willing           to       respond                  to          any       Police         advice.              Very           large

ground             as     advised.                  Because           of           the             numbers         involved,                and       the

relatively                    small           number           of    officers                       present          to     deal         with         them,           U

task          soon        became              impossible.                     It          was        not       possible             to      control             the

I      think         that           the       time        would,         be        about              2.00pm         when          .-fcpping.              L “ nt     w

    to       stop        pushing.               This           was       useless,                     nobody         took         any       notice,             and         most

    could           see        that           the crowd             near               the t u r n s t i l e s              was very             tightly              Pa c K e o ;

     nevertheless                    continued                 and       was             at         its    worse          not       long         before          3.00pm.

I can         retail         a Police           officer            shouting            out      over        a    vehicle             loudspeaker

to     the     crowd,         advising              to    stop       push i ng ,          but        the    advice             was    igno r e d,

1 recall            thinking             that       there        was      soon        going      to        be    injuries             if th e

pushing           didn't          stop,        although            f r o m my         position             I coal d n 1 1            see     if

there        were       any       persons           being        injured         nearer          to        the    turnstiles-

J. can        recall         that        there       wa s    a     point w h e n           there           was    a        sudden         surg e

forward           by    the       crowd,        obviously              by m o v e m e n t        near           the    turnstiles.                    I

c o u i q rtu t see           w h a >_• ;ia o. c a u e ci this               but       i a s s um e d that                 a    gate       h a o. b e e n

opened         to      relieve       the        pressure.                Had     this        not       been       done,            I do     believe

that     serious             injuries           or       damage        would       have         occurred              outside             the

entrances.               Also       at     t h is        p o int     I can       recall          large           numbers             of

supporters              rushing           to    the       entrances            from L ep p in g s                Lane.             1 saw        t h em

run a c r o s s         the       road     f r o m a wall              where       many         were        sitting             or    stood        near

by.      fay o w n ;faeiief .is                 that        these        people           did    not        have       tickets,             and

that     on seeimgii&fi^ssudderr-rush                               into       the        ground,           realising                that       a gate

had     been opened,                they        too       joined         the     rush.           This           obviously             added

considerably                 to    the     numbers           entering            the       entrance              at    the       same       time.

Supporters              continued              to    enter         the     g r o u n d,      but      shortly              after          3.00pm,            on

nearing           r a di o    messages              requesting             urgent         assistance                  in the          ground,            I

went     with          other       officers              into      the     ground,           onto          the    pitch,             near       the

Leppings           Lane       terracing.

X first           of ail          thought           that    a      pitch       invasion              had     taken             place,       but       it

was    soon a p pa r e n t           that           the     incident           wa s    much more                 serious.             As        soon

as    it w a s a p p a r e n t           that        people         were       getting           seriously                 injured          in the

crush        an    the       terracing,              with       other       officers             and       supporters,                    I first

o-r ail       recall          trying          to     break         down a strip                 of    the        perimeter             fencing

to    t ne    righI          of    the    goalmouth                i n o r ae r to         get        to a        pe r s o n w h o , i f not

already           dead,       was    very           seriously            i nj u r e d .      This          was        eventually             done,

the    man        lifted          through          the     broken         fence.           He        was     carried            onto        the

pitch        ana a t t en de d           to    by o t h e r         officers.              I believe                  he    wa s     d e a d at
                                                                                                                            Fife 4

    From      wuis      p oint       I assisted          in h e l p i n g    ail    present        in      1 if ting' o b v i o u s !

    dead      people       from      the     terracing,          and     also      assisting          injured        people

    from      the    terracing,            but    1 believe           it m u s t    have    been        in d o u b l e

    flyures.          On    three       occasions             1 assisted        o the r of f icers           who     1 could

   anu      a man     of    about       £ 5 — 30 years,           I ca n      rec a ll     thinking          that     they      were

    revive        them.         1 eventually            assisted        other       officers,         and      also

   supporters,             in    carrying         three       apparently           dead    young      men      from      the

   pi ten at         the    Leppings         Lane       end,     to    the   area     near       to   the      gymnasium.             I

   uid      not     stay with         any    of       these    b o d i e s , other        officers         remained,           and    1

   could      not     identify any               of    them.

   supporters           had      left      the    ground,         I wa s     completely           stunned          by all       that

   had      happened       and       could       not    initially        understand          how      it     could       have

   Happened.            i was        not    in the       ground       when    the     incident          began,        but      it    is

   my    opinion        that,        being       present       outside       the    Leppings          Lane        entrances,

   it w a s       extremely          lucky       thaI    no    serious       injuries        had      occurred           outside.

   was     closed          for    the       day.           However,          a short             time       later         I was       approached

    told     they were            friends             of    the    licensee                and       were     expected            there       by him,

    the    kick        off      time       approached             and       numerous             persons            were    seen       in

    directions             to    public          houses       continued                   during        the    afternoon,

    I rec a l l        that      at    the       pre-match             briefing             we       were     told        that     the       train

   Leppings            Lane      then       became          blocked          by the             masses        of     fans       making        t h eir

   way     to       the    ground          and       although          many        were         drinking            and    carrying           cans

    of    alcohol          the    banter             between myself                   ana       the     fans        was    friendly           ana

Although          towards           kick      oft      time       the       masses         thinned           cons»ide r a b l y             the re

ground.           I believe             that      at    sometime             after         £.OOpm           an    instruction                  was

given,       though          I do       not      know    by whom,                to    close         Leppings              Lane      to

During       th e      afternoon             I was      asked          by    possibly                7 or    6 fans           if     1 Knew

the    location             of a n y        ticket touts            for       them         to    bu y   tickets.                   I was         not

aware     of a n y          in    the       area.       This      seemed strange                      in so       much        as     the

previous          year       when       the      same    two       teams          pi ay e (3 at H i l l s b o r o u g h                I saw

asking       other          fans       if    they      had a n y        spare          tickets.              On       each        occasion

the    answer          was       no.

IS^lthe      kick- off            approached            I was          not       near       the       Leppings             Lane

Once     tne      fans       had. c l e a r e d        in L e p p i n g s         Lane          1 began making                    my way           to

O n my    arrival            at     that      location            a short             time       l a t e r , 1 saw            numerous

officers          in    that        area      bat      few     fans.             1 found             radio       transmissions                     at

not    issued with                radios         and had          to    rely          on    supervisory                 officers            to      pa

two    lanes             on    eith er         side.           As     the       two       pedestrians                   passed             in. fr o n t          of

the    van          1 became             aware       of    a     car       approaching                   the       crossing                from        behind

in    the       o ffside            lane.        I    could           see       the       vehicle             cle a rly           in       the       wing

m irror         and       it       was    travellin g               at     high       speed             w ith      the       d river            apparently

unaware             that       the       lig h ts     had        changed             to    red          ag ainst         him.              The       vehicle

was    w ith in           50       yds    of    the       crossing              when       it          began       to    brake             suddenly.

There       was          no    screaching             of       tyres        but       the          vehicle          dipped             considerably

onto       the       front          suspension             and        came       to       an       abrupt          h alt      at       the          side     of

my    van       in       the       o ffise      lane.            At       one    point             I    was     extrem ely                 w orried

that       it       would          not    be    able       to       stop        in    tim e            and    put       out       my       hand        to    try

and    attract                the    atten tio n           of       the     two       pedestrians                   shouting                   to    them        to

stop       where          they       were.

A fter      the          veh icle         had    stopped              they       managed                to    cross          the       carriagew ay

and    I    looked             down       from       the       cab        into       the       veh icle.                It    was          a    dark        grey

coloured             fam ily         saloon          eith er          an    Escort             or       Montego          and       contained                 5

mates,          2    in       the    front       and       three           in    the       rear.              They       a ll      appeared                 to     be

dressed             sm artly         in     casual         clothing              w ith         no       apparent             fo o tb all             favours

or    clothing                on    them.        However              I    did       see       what          appeared             to       be       red

scarves             in    the       veh icle.             A ll      the     occupants                   except          for       the          d river       were

drinking             what          appeared          to    be       Heineken              lager          from       green          Heineken

cans.           The       d river         was    s lig h tly              obscurred                from       my    view          by       the       roof        of

the    vehicle.

As    soon          as    I    looked          down       the       front        seat          passenger                seemed             to       take

offence             and       began       shouting             numerous              swear             words       at    me.           I       could        not

hear       what          he    was       saying       due        to       the    window                being       closed          but          it     was

easy       to       lip       read       words       such        as       "Fuck       off".              I    began          to    wind             my w i n d o w

down       to       say       something          to       him       but     the       lig h ts           changed             to    green             and     the

vehicle             set       off    at    speed          pulling           away          from          us    q uite         quickly.                  I    wa s

        I    continued                   our       journey,                   dropping                                        at    the     Sicey          Hotel        Public

     where            I    then              called            into           the    Pheasant                     Public            House       on Jaw Bone                  H ill.

    to        th eir           accents               I        took       it     that           they           were           Liverpool              supporters               on

                  late     tim e.       It    became          apparent          from     the    news       that       a    gate       at    the

                 ground         had    been    opened          to    allow       late      comers      into        the      ground          and    I

                   le ft      and       visited             the       W hite   Hart         public          house       which    is    situ ate      at     the

                   S tocksbridge.                      I    had       arranged         to    meet       a    frien d         called                             at

                   the       public          house.                            s a     jo in er     and          he    is    sometimes       employed           by

                   my     company            on    a       sub-contract              basis     as       and       when w o rk     of       that   nature         is

                   required.

                   When       I       arrived          at       the    public        house     I    saw          the    landlord,          Trevor

                   K ilw o rth ,            standing             at    the     entrance        and          he    was       obviously       vetting

                   people             before       he       allow ed         them      access       to       the       prem ises.

                   I    was       aware       that          a    sem i-fin al          fo o tb all          match       was    being       played    later

 that         day           at     the        H illsborough                   Stadium             and     the       W hite       Hart        public           house

 Pennines,                   to     M anchester                  and       the      North           West       of    the     country.                   This

 p ublic               house        is        reg u larly             frequented,                   on    match        days,           by    fo o tb all

 supporters.

 I    went             outside            the          public         house         and       I     would       estim ate          that           about           80

 persons                were        w ith in            the     bar        area,         a    m ixture          of     fo o tb all           supporters

 and       local             people.

 I    easily                ascertained                  that        the      fo o tb all              supporters            were           from       Liverpool

 These            people           were           behaving              in    an        o rderly         manner            and    there           was        no

 prem ises                  being        busy           we    decided            to      v is it        the     Pheasant           public              house

that        public                house           is     due     to      it      being            located       on a        quiet           side        road       off

the        main         highway               and       we      assumed            that           fo o tb all        supporters              may        not       have

1 « 15pm           (1315)           and           we    discovered               that          these          premises           were        also           being

rooms,             the       loung            bar       which         is      com fortably                furnished              and        the       public

bar    which                is     used           for    games          etc.            O utside          the       premises            there           is    a

terraced/paved                       area              where      benches               and       seats        are     used       by        customers

w ishing               to    remain               outside.              The      terraced                area       wa s    busy       and        I    quickly

ascertained                      that         a    large         number          of      the           people       outside        were           Liverpool

lounge         bar       which        was        very               busy          and        contained             a    large        number           of       people

which         included           the           regular               customers                    and       Liverpool           fo o tb all

supporters.                 The       supporters                      were              in       the    main       w ell       behaved          although

several            were     rather              noisey               but          nothing              unpleasant.               I    believe              that       I

overheard             the       landlord                                          say        that       several           of    the       supporters                 had

booked         a    table        at        the        premises                    for        a    meal       and       that     th is      was        a    regular

occurrence               whenever               Liverpool                        were        playing          at       S h effield .

________ a n d       m yself          were           enjoying                     a    drink           and   we        struck        up    a

conversation                w ith          2    Liverpool                        supporters                 who    were        standing           at       the       bar

next     to        us.      David              and        m yself                were        w earing         our       working           clothes              and    it

would        be     obvious           that           we        had           been        working             on a       building           site           as    we

I was     then      engaged               on    general        supervision                 duties.

Fr om about         1 pm        I was          outside       the L e p p i n g s           Lane        tarnsUles            with        the

pick-pocket            squad.              Crowds        w e re    building            steadily              but    t h e y were

constantly          being            'moved       o n ’ by m o u n t e d           officers,                ie e n t e r    the     ground

Numerous          people            were       asking       for    'spares'            (tickets              for    s al e ) .      A

number       of    them were               the w o r s e       for      drink.

Approx.       £pm          I overheard                a group        of       f our    or       f ive       Liverpool           supporters

( a ged 3 0 - 4 0 y e a r s )             discussing           whether          to     go       into        the    g r o u n d or   go        for

a    drink.        They         decided           it was       too      early         to    enter           the    ground and

Appro:-;.     2. 1 0 p m            Radio       message        asking          for     CID       officers           to a t t e n d at

the    gymnasium,               person          arrested.            I made           my    way        to    the    gymnasium           and

found     two m e n            had    been arrested                in     possession                 of     cannabis.            Also     in

the    gymnasium               at    that       t ime    were      several            people           reporting           the fts.

CID    officers            were       dealing           with      these        matters.

Approx.       2.30pm                I walked          r o u n d the       b a ck      of    the       North Stand            to     the

Leppings          Lane         end    intending             to go       outside            to    rejoin           the    pick-pocket

squad.        When         I    arrived           at G a t e A       I was         told         by     the     S t e w a r d s that       they

were    unable        to        let       me    out     through         the      gate       due        to    the     he avy crush

outside.           People            coming       through          the        turnstiles              were        complaining           to

uniform       officers               about       the     heavy       congestion                 of     f ans      outside,.

I returned          to         the    gymnasium.

fatalities          in the            ground          and   it w a s          decided           to    clear        the     gymnasium           in

preparation           for           use    as    a temporary mortuary.                               Shortly        afterwards

bodies       were     being           carried           in to the             gymnasium              on s t r e t c h e r s ,

advertising           hoardings                 and     bodily.           A    uniform           officer           was     instructed

to    remain w i t h            each       body.         I then         liaised            with       Detective

trying       to    remove          fans          without           tickets           from Le ppings                L a ne.       This       task

was    quite       impossible                as     droves          of L i v e r p o o l         f ans      with        tickets          were

arriving.            The         pavements             and. the          road w a y           were      completely              blocked         and

I was       made     aware         that          traffic           was       to    be     stopped          from     entering

Leppings          L a ne.          Shortly             afterwards                 a special           train        containing

Liverpool          fans          was    arriving              and       the       fan s    would        shortly           be a r r i v i n g     in

Leppings          Lane.           By 2 . 3 0 pm          the       situation              in L e p p i n g s      Lane         had

deteriorated                to    such an           extent          that          1 would        sa y      it b e c a m e       everyman

for    himself.              There       was        so      much        nastyness             from      some      fan s        towards         the

Police       t hat      a    colleague              of m i n e          PC    2330 Lockley                 commented            that      he    had

Lane     at     about           2 . 3 5 pm s ome         fans w e r e        arrested.             People           were        earning up

to m e        and     showing         obvious            f o r g e d .tickets,            s o me    of       them were           m ere

 photostat            copies        of       originals          and     this        had    created a             lot      of

antagonism             amongst           supporters.               At a b o u t        2 . 4 5 pm the          double           gates

 situate        to     the       l eft       (as y o u      look       from     outside            the       ground)        of

turnstiles             number         one      were       opened        to     ease       what      was       obviously              a    crush

at     those        turnstiles.                Myself         and PC         3135      Burnlees              went    with        Inspector

Sykes         and     other        officers           and eventually                 closed         these        gates          to       prevent

any     other         persons         from         entering        the       ground        using         t hat      method.               I was

 then    aware         that        problems           w ere     being        encountered                at    turnstiles                 A to G

 and    the     crush there                  was    unbelievable.                   I went         to    the     perimeter                gates

 situate        fifteen            yards       in fro nt          of    th e    turnstiles               and     tried          to       close

 one    of     them        to     prevent          a n y m o re    persons           from       getting          n ear      to       the

 turnstiles.                These        gates        were      forced         open       by    f ans        wanting        to       get       to

 the    turnstiles.                 The       gates were           pushed wide                 open and          f ans      began          to

 scramble           through         towards           the     turnstiles.                 Double         e xit      gates        just          in

 the    official            car      park      were       opened        to     e ase      the      pressure          of     the          crush

 outside,           one     young        male       fan     had a l r e a d y        been- l i f t e d         from within                 the

 crowd and            handed        over       the       top to        police        officers            and     f a ns    w ere

 scrambling            up the         outside            wall     to    get     i nto       the     gro u n d .          T he    opening

 of    these        gates         caused many             people        to     rush       through and               lots        of       people

 in L e p p i n g s        Lane      saw      the     opportunity              to    gain       entry and            did        so.        I

 then     heard        a    l oud     speaker            announcement               telling         fans       to    get        off       the

 p i tc h .      (I    thought           a    pitch       invasion had               taken         place).           A    rad i o

 message        was        passed        for       all    available            officers            to go       o nto      the        pitch.

enquired          about       a     pub    n ear         to    the       seven       arches       where       they       had     been

We    were     also      asked          by a g r e a t             number       of       supporters          of all        age    groups

where       the    nearest           "pub"          wa s      that       was    open.           They were          all     advised          that

to    the    best       of our          knowledge              all       public          houses     in the         a r e a were

closed.           A great          number           of     supporters               were     carrying         4    packs w i t h

them.        The    majority              of    the        people         carrying           4 p a cks a n d        asking        for

Throughout          the       tour        at    Leppings                Lane    Roundabout             there       was     no

aggression          shown          by     the       supporters                who    appeared          to    be    in g o o d     spirits

and      looking        forward           to    the        g ame.         It was          noticed        that      from about

1.30pm       a growing             number           of     the      persons          w i t h 4 pac k s        were       seated        on

walls       in L e p p i n g s       Lane       close          to       the    junction with Penis tone

Road.        There       appeared              to    be no          problems              with these          as    there        were       a

number       of    officers             in the           vicinity             with       them,    and also          a highly

visible        presence            of     officers             in the          area.

The      attitude        of       the     supporters                towards          us was       very       jovial        in fact

comments          were    passed           to       the       effect          that       t h e y w ere      not    used     to P o l i c e

During       the    t our         at L e p p i n g s          Lane      Roundabout,              whilst       there        had    been

continual          flow       of     spectators                both       towards          the L i v e r p o o l     side        of" the

ground       and    Notts.           Forest          end,          as    far as          I am a w a r e      there       were     no

Leppings          Lane          from       the       roundabout.

At    2 . 4 0 pm the            s ame      date       myself        a n d PC         2735       Wade     relieved          the     2

vehicles          could             get    through.              Service            buses       were     advised        of      the

situation             and       they       took       alternative               routes.            To    the     best      of m y

3.00pm           Th e         area    seemed          deserted            of    supporters              so we     began         to w a l k           to

our      Phase        2       position.

As    I approached                   the    ground          the r e       appeared          to     be a     lar g e     number             of

supporters                walking          away       from       the      ground          towards        Leppings          Lane

Roundabout.

A    lot- of      l o cal           residents          were        complaining              about        the     problems          caused

by    thg    large             number       of       supporters            t hat      had       been     there       and     the       large

amount       of       cans          and    fish and             chip w r a p p e r s        thrown        into       their       gardens.

Upon      reaching              tne       Leppings          Lane       entrance            1 was        informed        that       there

had      been     trouble             inside          the       ground and            that       with     other        serials,             ha d

there       were          a    large       number          of    supporters               leaving        the     ground and

walking          up       towards          Leppings             Lane      Roundabout,              they were           visibly             shaken

and      upset        and       some       were       shouting            abuse       to    Police        officers.              Virtually

immediately                   our    serial          was    called         into       the       ground      to    the      rear        of       the

searching                for    friends             and    relatives.              I was          instructed               to     clear         a way

for    ambulances                   to    get       through.              Along    with       other          officers            the       centre

persuade             spectators                who    were       milling          about,          to    leav e          the     ground          and

spoke          to w e r e       shocked             and    readily agreed                to       do    this.            I remained              in
  company       w i t h PC    2735 Wade        whilst       it was          announced          t hat      the    game       had

  been    abandoned          and    for   everyone         to       leave      the    gr ound.           'The m a j o r i t y     of

  Once    the    stand was          cleared along'with                   PC W a d e    I went        into       the    seating

  Whilst       awaiting       for     a de-brief       I heard            an    inspector           say     that      he    had

  been    kicked whilst             giving     somebody             mouth      to m o u t h    and       that    another

  officer       who    had    been     checking       for       a    pulse      had    been     kicked          in    his    hand.

There      were        groups        of      fans         walking            up     and    down Leppings                  Lane       asking

others       for       tickets,             this         went         on     from    the       time       of     my    arrival          at    the

point       until         just     before               kick-off.              I saw       several             instances           of

spectators             purchasing                  tickets             I think        25 was           th e      asking        pri ce .




The    mood       of      the    fans          ar riving was                  generally             happy/boisterous/singir>gr

obviously            looking           forward               to th e m a t c h .           I did           not    see     any      bad

behaviour            as    such        but         as    time          got    nearer       kick-off              there       were       still

many       asking         for     tickets.



From       about       2pm      I was          w it h PS              1561    Reynolds              standing          in f r o n t      of a

private         garage          area        almost               opposite          Eskdale          Road        just     after       I think

Bickerton            Road.         This            was       a    result       of    a    complaint              from     an    elderly

couple       who       were       washing               their          car    in    the        garage       area       regarding             fans

using       the      garages           as      a    toilet.




From       that      point        we      could          see          down Leppings                 Lane    to    th e    bottom          at    the

r o u n d a b o u t at       Penistone                  Road,          during       that        time       there       was     a continuous

stream          of   fans       arriving,                causing             problems           for       traffic        o n th e       road,

one       f a n was       spoken          to       by P S R e y n o l d s           for        deliberately walking                       o n the

road       in    front       of a         b us .         The m o o d          was    generally              good       natured          and

enthusiastic.                   There          seemed             to    be    no    let        up    of    numbers        arriving             and

about       2.50pm         I made           the         point          to    PS Reynolds              that       there       was     no      way

could       they       get       i n to     the         ground          for    kick-off,              and       for    them     to      do     so

the       kick-off         would          have          to       be    delayed.            About          3pm    1 heard        on P S

Reynold's             radio       that         there             was    a    large        crowd       at    the       turnstiles             and

apparent             trouble        there.

went     directly             to    to       the    turnstile            area,           large       numbers          of       persons

there,        I saw       some          climbing           up over           the wall           i n to     the       ground          and many

of     them     running            up and          climbing         over          th e    turnstiles             themselves.                       The

time     then would                be    about        3.05pm        just          after        the m a i n       bulk          of    them          had

been     le t      in    through             the    gate w h i c h           had       been     opened.              Not       knowing             at

that     time       that          the    gate       had     been      opened             I prevented             several             youths

from     climbing             over       the       turnstiles            and moved              others          to    the       other          side
                    %


of     the    gates       in       front       of     the     turnstiles.                     Remained          there          and       several

•fans*        leaving             the    ground           then   informed me                   that      there were                 serious

problems           inside,          one       described          it      it as           being worse             than          the       Heysel

disaster.




Many     people          leaving             the    ground       now a nd              the     general          attitude             n o w was

of     anger       and    sheer          hatred           towards        th e      Police,           many       threatening

officers           and    calling             us m u r d e r e r s ,         the       main were           very       hostile                towards

u s,    so m u c h       so       that       I was        afraid      for         my     own and         other        officers

safety.            Many       of    them       were        in t e a r s .




About        3.20pm       I was          in d e s p e r a t e       need          of     the    toilet,          so       I went             into

the     ground          and       walked       d o w n the       side         of       the     North Stand                to    the          toilet,

there        were       large       numbers           leaving         t he        stand        by    them,       while          in       the

toilet        (alone)             I was       subjected          to      a    barrage           of    threats             and       abuse          from

about        3 0 men,         3    or    4    told        them   to      leave           me    alone       as    it w a s           not       my

fault,        if    they          had    not       done     this      I feel             sure       that    I would             have          been

assaulted.               On       leaving          t he    toilet        I walked              around       the       back          of       the

West     Stand          trying          to    find a way            on       to    the        playing area,                but       no t

knowing         the      ground          could       no t    g et     on.          Unable           to g et      on       to    the          pitch       I

then     had       to    return          outside           the   ground            and        join    other          officers                there.

Ambulances              and       fire       tender* were             arriving                now and a          steady             continuous

         I remained      there    until    we    were    stood       down    and    asked    to   regroup       in    the

         North    Stand.     From   there       I walked       with    my    serial    to C l a y w h e e l s   for

PULFREY


Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when shouted

at by myself, carried on regardless.                       At this time my attention was drawn to

back       of    turnstiles      for North Stand where Police Constables                         from my serial

had come through the turnstiles.                    Entrance gates             ’A ’ were shaking violently.

Fans       coming    through turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting                               THEY RE GETTING

KILLED          OUT THERE,      THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS,’ and screaming for

gate       ’A* to be opened.

Gate       ’A*    opened and crowd surged               forward        through    the    gate.     The    gate   was

closed again only seconds later.

Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool                              fans coming through suddenly a

crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are closed.                                      Only people now

attempting           to   get     in   are   very       drunk    Liverpool        fans.     Turnstiles      closed

scuffling breaking out between Liverpool fans and in one occasion a drunken

Liverpool fan lashed out at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle. Suddenly

Special          Inspector beckons wildly at me.                   I ran to gates           'B ’ where I saw an

obviously dead boy being put in an ambulance, passed a near naked dead man

 at      gate     'B’ and       into   the   area   between        gate     'B'    and    the    tunnel    for   the

 terraces.          In this area approximately 10 dead people were strewn about.

 I       checked    these     to ensure      they   were        dead    then     assisted    with    the   injured

 people          some of who were also lying in this area.                         I then,      after seeing the

 arrival          of ambulance     crews, ran through the tunnel                    to the terraces where I

 was met by a wall of Liverpool fans, looking over them I could see the pitch

 had been          invaded,     people around me in the tunnel began moaning, 1 assisted

 to       escort     these      people   out   of       the     tunnel     where    if    they     were    injured,

 directed ambulance crews to them.

 M yself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair haired boy

 in a Liverpool shirt and light trousers in the lane running adjacent to the

            ✓*

       River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

       People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.

       Attention       called   for    Leppings    Lane    terraces   where   Liverpool   fans   were

       attacking another Liverpool fan who they say was picking up belongings from

       the terraces and putting them in his pocket.

       Called by another officer to go to Leppings Lane.                      On   the way assist to

       remove    bodies    from back of terrace           tunnel to lane running adjacent to the

       River     Don   then   form    cordon   helping    fans   to leave ground,    stream of urine

       running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

s. .   Fans leaving ground violent and asking if the match is o f f .

       Ambulances convey bodies away.

       Liverpool fans leave, then instructed to go to North Stand for de-brief.

       Throughout these events I felt nothing, I just helped where I could.

       It seemed as though nobody really knew what to do but help with the dead and

       injured.

       I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous occasions and

       usually have policed the same turnstiles without any trouble.

            At    9 ,0 0    am    on    Saturday,     15th April,         I    commenced        duty at E c c l e s f i e l d

            Police         Station,       where    transport       was ava i l a b l e       for t r a n s p o r t a t i o n down

            to the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football           Ground.

           A b r i e f i n g was         given by Chief Supt.             Duckenfield           in the N o r t h S tand

            and      1 was       part of a serial          together w ith 9 other                 officers.under          the

            comm a n d      of PS 323 Proctor.              Our    duties were             to be in L e p p i n g s     Lane.

           Prior       to     commencing         our duties,       after       the    initial      briefing       was     „

            completed,            a further       briefing was         g iven by       inspector S ykes           to    our

           Serial,          outlining       our    overall      duties.

           We     then      took up our          position on L e p p i n g s         Lane,     on the      f o o t p a t h which

            runs      in front          of the    turnstiles.

           The       volume       of spectators         increased as          the     day went on.           Pe o p l e were

           a t t e n d i n g at this        location,        requesting         the    location       of    public

           houses.           One       named the     “B e e-hive" was m e n t i o n e d         in particular.

           Many       supp o r t e r s were       sat ana stood aro u n d on Leppings Lane,                         who   had

           no     i n t e n t i o n of entering         the ground until              as    late as     possible.

           M a n y were          drinking alcohol          from both          cans and       large    bottles,         however,,

           due       to the      number     of    people     doing    this and         the thin sp r e a d        of Police
                                                                                                                      : PAGE ' .

Officers         it was          impossible        to do a n y t h i n g        about       it.     I was

c o n t i n u a i iy a t t e m p t i n g    to    keep       both    tne    footpath         and    roadway       Clear       of

spect a t o r s       who were       just        intent       on s t a nding       around.

A    couple      of    coaches a r r i v e d at              the L e p p i n g s   Lane      end of the ground,

wh i c n was        u n p l a n n e d and these were                empt i e d and the            fans dealt with

accordingly.                Some alchohol              was    brought       on one         of these    coaches and

the driver was                i m m e d iately v e r b a l ly cautioned.

Assistance            in clearing           the    road and          paths      was    given by mounted

officers            from time        to time.

B y about           2 pm the amount               of    people       in the area had grown and by now

m any    people were              stood around or inking an d genet ally obstructing                                      the

h ig h w a y .

At £ . 3 3       pm a large         fight        broke       out on L e p p i n g s        Lane and together with

PC HI EG T horpe             we arresteci a y o u t h each,                   who were        fighting with each

other.

An attempt was made                  to take the              prisoners         to the Police Roo m via                   ’A ’

Gate,        however        this was        impractical             due    to the      large       crowds outside

the     turnstiles.              We then went            down Vere R oad              to the Police Room.

Wh i l s t we were           going, down Vere                Road,        fans were jumping ov-er the

barriers            and asking        to    buy the t i c k e t s           of t h o s e   arrested.
         *
This     had been the              general        order       of .the day.            Many    fans were wan d e r i n g

a r o u n d want i n g       to buy        tickets,          o b v iously m any        people      had a t t e n d e d at

the ground without tickets.

At    one     point        one    fan a p p r o a c h e d with an obvious                   forged    ticket,

photocopied,               w h i c h he had       paid        20 for.

The     prisoner was             booked      in and          I then a t t e n d e d at the Gym to                 do

paperwork.

At about         3 pm all          a v ailable         officers were            requested.

1 attended            in L e p p i n g s   Lane,        there was then a large spill                        of    fans

coming        out     of    * C ’ gate.          They    looked red faced and on going                           to    'C *

  gate     I saw        fans     laid      on    the       floor,        distressed.           I assisted            as    best       1

  could        and     then went          towards- the             tu n n e l   which     gives        access       to    the

  terraces.             Officers          were       at    this     location        tending        victims,          I went          on

  to     the    terraces         and      assisted           in the       pulling       back     of     the    fencing          in

  order        to a s s i s t    people         to     get   out.

  1 saw        many        bodies        laid        one u p o n         another         on    the     t e r r a c e s . The

  majority           of w h i c h    appeared             dead           1 then ass is te d          with     other       officers

  in     picking           up m a y b e    half        a dozen        b o d i e s arid p a s s i n g    them    through          the

  fencing         to    other       officers.

  I do     not       know who        I passed             them     to,    nor    can    I describe            any    of    the

  bodies        I dealt         with.       All        the   bodies         I moved      were      from       the    floor       on

  tiie t e r r a c e s .

  I regularly work                  at    Sheffield          Wednesday           Football        Cluo and always                 in

  th e    same       location,           Leppings         L a ne    on    coach     reception.             I worked            the

  same     semi-final            last year.

  Eventually            we w e r e       taken       from    the      terraces         and    resumed.

                Police       S t a t i o n a n d was           then        transported                down    to H i l l s b o r o u g h        Football

                Ground       where        at    10.00am            I attended              a briefing             for    the       Semi-Final

                Football          Match        between Liverpool                         and Nottingham Forest,                       My    duties

                for     that      event        were      on     serial          19 a n d        the    officer          in    charge       of    that

                serial       w as    PS 323 Proctor.                       At       about       11.00am after                the    briefing

                together          with     the     rest         of    the       serial          I went       to    the L e p p i n g s      Lane           end

                of    the    ground.            Our      duties        were          outside          the    ground          ana    were    to

                supervise           the    arrival            of     the       Liverpool          supporters             in a n d     around          the

                turnstile           area.          Upon        our     arrival             I saw a n u m b e r           of L i v e r p o o l

                supporters           outside          the       ground          appar ent ly waiting                    to    get    in.        These

                supporters           were       well      behaved.                  At    about       12 n o o n    the       turnstiles           at

                that     end were          opened and a trickle                            of    supporters             went       inside.         At

                this     early       stage        there        were        a    few       supporters          stopping             others       and

                asking       if     they       had any          spare          tickets.           These        people         were    moved        on.

prevented           from        qo in >3 into          the    ground.              ihe      paverne nt a r e a s           around             the

Lappings           Lane     end were             thronged with                Liverpool             supporters             and       I was

conti nuousiy moving                       supporters             from       the    paved area               ana     in the          mi dale

of   the      road.         These          persons          were    directed             either         into       the     ground             or

a w ay   f rom      it i f t h e y u 1d n o t ha v e a                       X i ck e t .




At   about         2.30pm        the       queuing          area    for       the    Leppings             Lane       end       was    packed

with     Liverpool              supporters.                 with    other          officers          from       our       serial          I

entered           the     crowd       to    try       to    ease    what        seemed         to    be      becoming           a serious

congestion.                By    this       time        traffic         had     been        stopped          on L e p p i n g s       Lane

as   Liverpool             supporters                were    approaching             the       ground          in m a s s .          Many          of

these        pe o p l e    seemed          obviously          the       worse       for      drink.            I could          see       that

mounted           officers        were          trying       to e a s e       the    crowd          situation             by

instructing               supporters             to     queue      in a n       orderly           fashion and              telling

those        without        tickets             to    get    away       from       the      crowd.           Many     of       the

supporters              displayed a              hostile          reaction          to      these       requests.               I myself

entered           the     crowd       to    t r y to m a k e        it m o r e       orderly            as     by t h i s       time

there        was    a     lot    of    pushi ng            towards       the       turnstiles.                 None       of    the
         *

Police        action        seemed          to       be a b l e    to    alter       the a c t i o n s          of    th e      crowd.




As   the      time        got    towards             3.00pm       there       were       s t ill     hundreds             of

supporters              walking        to       the     ground      from        either         end of L e p p i n g s            L a ne.

It   became         increasingly                 impossible             to    direct         these        people          and    from

where        I was        stood       on    the       outside       of       the    queuing          crowd         towards           the

roadway           persons        in    the       crowd,       including             Police          Officers,             were       having

problems.               I tried        on       several       occasions             to      get     into       the    crowd          to

split        it    up     but    it    became           increasingly               impossible             to    penetrate             it.

Among        the    crowd        just       a    few       feet    from       me    I saw         one     youth       selling

tickets           and     I heard          him       start    the       bidding          for      a ticket           at        20.00 and

within        seconds             I heard          someone           offer       him      35.00         and     he m o v e d       on.




At    about           or    just       after       3.00pm,           I saw       that      'A'     Gate        that      gives      access

to    th e    North           Stand         and     either                 or    " C” Gates           were      opened        arm       this

instantly               eased         the    density           of    the       crowd     outside.              These       gates        f r o m my

recollection were                       only        open       for    a few          seconds.            Supporters            were-s         w   I j.

coming           to     the      ground       after           the    no rm a l       kick-off         time and            there     wa*

still        a     crowd         outsioe.              T he    supporters             that       were     outside          the     ground

prior        to       the       gates        being       opened were             in a v e r y a g i t a t e d             mood      a n d w e re

clearly            very a n n o y e d             that    they       could       not     get      in on        time.



Some     time           after         3.00pm           1 received          a    radio      message            that       r e q u e s t e d aii

officers              to a t t e n d         inside       the       ground       at     the      Leppings           Lane     ena.         t

then         ran        through         *A ’ G a t e      and       into       the     ivot th S - a n d       <=i.u. on      wo

pitch.             When         I first           entered       the        inside       playing          area       of    the      ground          I

saw     a mass             of     people          including          Police          Officers          on     the     track        behmu

 impression                was        that    there       had       been        some     sort     of     pitch        invasion.

There were                 many        supporters              climbing          over     the     metal         fencing.            A=>           9 ot

 whom        were          in a h i g h l y        distressed              condition and                 some    collapsed.               1

saw    that    one       of    those       bodies       was       -a m a n    who       I now        know        to   be a Carl

Brown.        I checked             him    for     signs      of     life         but    he w a s         d e a d.    With       the

help    of    some       of    the    Liverpool             supporters             1 carried              th e    body      on &

3.30am       the    following             day w h e n       the    d e c e a s e d was          identified             by    his

father.        The       body       showed       no    apparent          signs          of     violence           other      than a

mark    on    this       head.        I handed          the       body       over       to     the    mortuary           staff         at

watery       Street.




My    feelings       at       the    time     of      the    incident             in s i d e    the       ground       were       of

disbelief          and    a thought           t ha t    such a thing                 couldn't             happen       at

               After        the     briefing         at      Hillsborough              I was     detailed             to     serial     31    under

               At    this      location           the     majority          of    p eo p l e    were     Liverpool             fans.         On

               several         occasions            I was         approached           by L i v e r p o o l      fans        who    wished        to

               know       either           where     to      go    in      the     ground,           whether          any     public        houseswere

               I advised            them      that      no    public        houses        were       open and           if    they     did    not

               have     a    ticket         they     should          l e ave     the    vicinity          of H i l l s b o r o u g h .        The

               that       the      fans      were       drunk       but    were        in v e r y     h i g h spirits.

                passing         up a n d        down        the    road       on L e p p i n g s             Lane.       The    fans       appeared         to

                be     getting        their          bearings           and     once       done          a    lot    returned        back      along
 I
                the     road a sking             directions               for    different                   public      houses      mainly         the

 I             Sportsman             or    the       Th e    Beehive.            Most          of    them were             in g o o d      boisterous

               n'iOOd l a u g h i n g       and       joking         with       us as          to w h o        might      win     the      match.
 I
                It     was     noticed          that        whilst       most        of    them          were       asking      directions            for

                pubs     they        sti l l     were        carrying           either          single          cans      or m u l t i p l e      pa cks     of
 I
               cans       (as    if       brought           from     supermarket                packs)-of              alcohol.

 I             All      of     the    time       there        appeared           to       be    a    l a r ge       number      of   fans      standing
about       and moving                backwards          and       forwards         within          the       flow       of    the

general       crowd asking                   for      spare        tickets         or    tickets          to     sel l .           Offers

were     being            made    for       25     for      a ticket         from anyone                 willing          to       sell.

Groups       of y o u t h s           began      to    gather        at     various           times       and       money          could          be

seen     exchanging               hands       and      someone           jumping         about       as       though          they          had

■won o n     that          occasion.             If a s k e d       to m o v e      or    br eak         up    the       groups          would

just     disperse            to a f e w          yards        further        down        the    street.              Very          few       fans

seemed       to       pass       by w i t h o u t      being        in    possession            of       cans       of    aicohol.

The    flow          of    fans       along      Leppings           Lane     never        really          seemed          to       ease        up

at    any    stage          in    particular             and       althou gh most              had       possession                of

alcohol       at          that    stage       they       were       w i l l i n g to      chat,          pass       time       of       da y      in

Many     appeared            to       queue      at    the     chip       shop      just       down       th e      road       a    little

and    would          walk       back       past      us.      1 was        asked        on    countless             occasions                 for

the    two       pubs       already mentioned                      and    if we         knew where             the       Liverpool

fans     were         meeting.

It w a s     mentioned                in    passing         by PC        H e b i d g e .that        if 3 4 , 0 0 0 . t i c k e t s             had

by P o l i c e        Officers and               thinking           that      the W a d s l e y B r i d g e              train

mentioned             must       have       arrived         end     that      the       start       of    the       m a t cn shouidn'* t

be     l o n g off        although          there        s till     appeared             to    foe a v e r y         large          numfcer

of     fans hanging              about        and     asking        for      tickets.

Shortly          afterwards                and whilst          there        wa s    still       a    constant             flow          I

remember             a male       fan       running/jogging                 down        the    centre          of    th e       road

singing          to       himself          about      "I' m    coming,         I'm       coming*', I r e m e m b e r                    looking

I heard          a    large       cheer       from       the       ground and            the     singing            as    trsough the

t e a m s ;,had come          out     onto       the     pitch.          I stood            at     some       p o int     thereabouts

on one       of    the       barriers           on the       r oa d    junction             I was        at    and       remember

thinking          that       there     seemed           an a w f u l     lot      of    fans          still       to     get     into       the

ground       and       that    the     line          of P o l i c e    Horses          directly             in f r o n t        of the

gates      appeared           aggravated              and    that      heads       of       the       horses        were        bobbing

up a n d     down       I could        see       fans       climbing         up    the       fencing           to      the      left       of

the    gates       and       trying        to    get     in.       I again         stood          on     the      barrier            and

remember          hearing        a    loud       speaker        message           about          go    to     the N o r t h          and you

will    get       in,     I do       not    remember           the     exact       words          but       re c a l l    that        the

mass    crowd          then    seemed           to    thin     out a      little.

At    3.10    pin I w a s        joined          at E s k d a l e      Road       by PC          214 Cou lso n            and        told

that    there          was    trouble           within       the      ground       a n d we           were     needed           at    the

ground,           Want       straight           away     to L e p p i n g s       Lane       entrance             and     looked           for

PS Reynolds             unable        to    see       him and         then     almost            immediately              whilst

stood      near        to a g r o u p       of       other     Police        Officers             was       told       by a

Uniformed          Inspector           to       go an d      then      taken       into          g r o u n d at L e p p i n g s            Lane

and    told       to    form     a    cordon          to g u a r d     the     dead         and       injured          fa n s    from       the

remainder          of    fans        coming          out.      Cordon        formed          shoulder             to     shoulder

with    other          officers        to       guard       bodies       and      keep       passage           f re e     for        the

flow    of    ambulances.

Stayed       at    this       point        u n til     all     the     injured          persons             had     been        removed

ana    the    dead       persons           had       been    cordoned          off      with          barriers           and     green

sheets       by    fire       service.

Then    s e nt     with       10 o t h e r       officers          and    told         to    try and           clear         off      the

fans    from       the       bridge        and       Leppings         Lane     entrance               in o r d e r       that        the

Whilst       doing       this        it wa s         noticed       that      fans       were        very abusive                and

aggressive             towards        Police          and most         swore      using           words        like:

"Fucking          Police       ha d M i n e r s        no w ha d       us.";      " I t ’s all            our       faults."

fans      wanted       to h a n g         about          near      the       entrance          looking               for    friends,,

relatives’            and were            very        reluctant              to m o v e      even        a few         feet       further.

Whilst       in the         ground            entrance            the       cordoned         fans        were         reluctant          to

move      to a l l o w      in the            ambulances               and    kept        w a n t i ng      to       look     behind       the

cordon       and were            very         abusive            towards        both       services              and       in f a c t    were      at

times obstructive.

After      all     the      fans         were       cleared            from     the       ground         and         nearby       entrance,

was    told      to    return            to     ground           and    take       up     seats        as     in b r i e f i n g ,       which

was    done.          Noticed            then       it was         7.10        pm.        Between           £.56       pm a n d      7 . .ID pm

fans      wanted       to m a k e          complaints              against           Police        and        were         informed        to

contact       their         local          force         seemed         very       od d    that        in all          the     panic       and

confusion          fans         could         even       think         of    such       a thing.

Fans      even     tried         obstructing                 ambulances              from      getting               in at     the

Leppings         Lane       entrance               and      on a r r i v a l       of     each ambulance                    fans     had      to

happening          and      radios            should         h a ve     been       issued         to     at      l e ast      every      two

officers.

It w a s     not      at    all          possible           to m a k e       any     organised              plans          whilst       the

  Also       from       the a m o u n t    of     fans       asking         directions            to pubs         it a p p e a r e d

  that       they       h a d no   intention            of        being     at    the     g r o u n d at     a     reasonable

  time       in o r d e r    to m a k e      an    orderly           entrance.

  There       was    hundreds         of     fans       without          tickets         hanging        about          the    Lepping

  Lane       area,

  Finally,          I felt         that    whilst        stood          outside      after        the      incident           on

  Leppings          Lane     whilst        the     fans          were    going      out     they      were        very       abusive

  and       threatening            towards        all    officers.                On more       than       one      occasion           I

  felt       that    I wa s        going     to    get       a    'smack      in the        face      f r o m a fan'            an d

  having       been       told      that     we    were          to e x p e c t    abuse,       had     to       t ak e   it.       Had

  any       officer       made      the    slightest              remark      re a fans           verbal          abuse       then a

  separate          incident         could        have       been       sparked      off       in s e c o n d s .         I felt

  very       threatened and               h u m i l i a t e d at        having      to    take      such abuse               after

do     not    know       to    close       the       turnstile           doors,         this       was       done     and       the       cr owd

of     su pip o r t e r s     present          were       moved        back     to     the     road      side        of    the m a i n

gates        which were             then       c l o s ed -       I remained            on th e         outsioe           of    the m a i n

gates.            On m y a r r i v a l         at    the       entrance         initially              the    large        gates          into

the     g r o u n d we r e c l o s e d .

At     this       time      I was        unaware           of w h a t    wa s     happening             inside        the       g r ound,           I

wa s    not       in   possession              of    a     personal        radio.            After       a short           while          I

heard        conversation                relating           to    people        i ns i d e     the      ground        b e in g

injured,           an a m b u l a n c e        arrived           and was        directed           into       the     ground.

Numerous           people          were    still           milling       around         outside          th e      gates        when a

fire      tender         arrived,          conversation                 wa s    then      heard         relating           to d

fatalities,              people          then       slowly        started         to    leave          the    ground,           further

ambulances             then arr iv ed               together           with     other        f ir e     tenders,           by       now

people        were       leaving          the       ground        in    lar g e      numbers           m a n y were        shouting

abuse        at    Police          Officers          saying         it w a s      our     fault         for     opening             the       gate

and     accusing            the     Police          of     killing       people,          the      atmosphere              outside             the

g r o u n d was        so     tense       with       the       obvious         signs      of      hatred        towards             the

Police        that       1 wa s      fully          expecting           an a ss au lt          against          me    and       other

officers.                                       •

Word      was      now being             passed          around        that     there        were       numerous           deaths             and

supporters             were        talking          about        bodies        being      all      over.           Some        of    the

supporters             were        obviously             injured and when                 offered            help     they          refused

it a n d      just       became          abusive           towards       the      officers.

I remained             outside           the     ground          in a n a t t e m p t        to    keep       the     road          clear

for      emergency            vehicles,             I returned           to     the     North Stand                sometime           later

when       the     ground          had    been       cleared.
                                                                                                                         page:
                                                                                                                         R66

  I had     no     contact        with    any       deceased         persons       at    all.

  I cannot         sa y w h a t    time       the    turnstiles         opened          to    th e    public      but    can

  say    t h at    I was     not       aware     of a n y     problems        outside          th e      Leppings       Lane

  entrance         which     I could          see    fr o m m y      point-

  I have       performed          duties       at    previous         major    events          at     Hillsborough              and

  have    always         been     in    the      locality       ot    Leppings          Lane       the re    have     been       ho

  serious         incidents        at p r e v i o u s    events       1 have       attended.

  From    my      observations 1 would                  say   that     the    major          cause       of the      incident

  was    the      f a ct   that     so m a n y      people    arrived         late      and     had      no i n t e n t i o n    of

  entering         the     ground       in g o o d      time.        They    had     consumed            large    amounts         of

  alcohol         although        only    a    few w e r e      obviously          dru n k ,       and    there     were

  hundreds         of    supporters           present       without         tickets          who     usually      still         try

  to    gain      entry    any     way    they       can.

  1 was     also        asked     by    supporters          where      the    nearest          p u b was.

                On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile 'H* a small section of
                fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
                cant breach of the fence could bo made, giving access to tte circulating
                corridor.   From the enquiries I made it appeared that this liad been done
                by fens during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure, at the
                right manent to gair- entry to the Stadium.

    8           Inforrration was patted to officers under iny command'by m unidentified
                 Liverpool police officer, that lie had heard fans planning to rush the
                 'H1, 'J' and *K' turnstile*. This confirmed my own view that these were
                 the'irost vulnerable areas and therefore the most likely to be attacked.

    <5          .As tiiTiS progressed, I noticed that th«re were more people in that area
                 sufferinq the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
                 This culminated in a nuni*r of fights at the 'pinch point \ the narrowest
                 point of the concourse, outside the Stadium offices.       The fights were
                 caused apparently by the sale of tickets by ’touts’. Although w e U known
                -touts were not evident, there seemed to be a number of people se          g
                 one or two tickets,     Tlie fans were keen to attack such people and yet
                 also to buy the tickets at inflated prices.

    10           By 12#30pm, the crowd was building up generally, but especially so cutside
                  turnstiles        •J’ and 'K*.    Decause this area is confined, I hod to
                  p ^ i a cordon of policehorses and foot police between the T.V. confound
                  and turnstile 'H' to prevent the danger of crushing.

    11           outside of    the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder ant>ng fans

                  assisting one of my officers in treking an arrest.

                  The turnstiles were late in opening because a lorry was still carrying
    12.           cut eon* work in the circulating corridor.        This lorry could only make
                  an e x i t through a gate at the side of turnstile K . ^ ^
                  before 1 15pm but caused      quite severe problem with crowds waiting for

                  a lot of effort was reouired to prevent a large number of illegal

     (C'    at the cordon and allowing only tiiose with tickets through. Many people
            were rsluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
            from than.    They took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks and
            other places, tfiich madfi it difficult when production was demanded. The’
            nurber .of street n^beries for this event are -luch higher than for similar
            events.

lg#        "Thare were new some 300 people on the wtsidfi of the cordon vto did not
            have tickets tut were still -anxious to find fl way into the.Stodiiifl. Rather
            than leaving the cordon as a fixed target, I decided to ocntnence a sweep
            of the -concourse, pushing these fanB tcwards the Royal Tunnel and sway
           ’from the vulnerable area.

17          When the swesp from tha other side, turnstiles JA* to 'E‘, reached the
            Royal Tunnel, the crowd which nurbered about* 500 began throwing bottlss
            arri_ cans at polio?. A number of arrests were made during the confpletion
            of the sweep.*

18          Despite the sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
            during the pr^p-p^ft of the game. At about half tune, thsre was a determined
            atteTpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadium
            Offices and turnstile ’H 1. This was successfully repelled.

19.         Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadium were cpened
             in preparation for the exodus♦ At this stage, Liverpool -were in the lead
                                                   Hcweverti^., equalising ^ ^ . t h e n ^
             scored by Everton. "'This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
             end       those still around the ground without <tickets. All managed to
             get into bays around the Staditsn to vsjtch extra tune*

              The n u rrfcer of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadium, does not fully
20 .
              reflect the n©gnit\xle of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Rather a balance
              is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
              the nvnfcar of police left to control the crowd.

 21   .       Cri this occasion, there was a -rapport between the Liverpool and Everton
              aunoortera      Had this rot been the case, I believe nwch greater disorder
              S S T h a w ' emnataa f w n the section of fareOeteDriiw!I to gain entrance
              to the Stadiun, regardless of the coat in any terra, to others.

              Ravine described a lot of bad behaviour cn tte part of SOrte fans, I
 22.                    the joajority were well behaved and concerned for the safety of
              themselves and others.

The gane kicked off at the scheduled time of 3pm.     At that moment, the

turnstile monitor In the Police .Control Box was registering a total of

A2,523 spectators in the Stadium.’ I instructed Police Constable BHANNIGAN

to make a written record of this figure, which he did.     At that timer, the

Norwich sections of the Stadium were full to capacity, whereas the Everton

sections were not.   The closed circuit TV cameras showed substantial crowds

in Witton Lane, particularly in the vicinity of the ’L ' block turnstiles,

of Everton supporters.   They were not queuing in an orderly fashion, and I

instructed that the mounted and foot officers in that vicinity should be

augir.ent.ed by mounted and foot officers from Trinity Read (the Norwich

turnstiles) where there was no queuing or crowds.     The crowd in Witten Lane

was boisterous ar.d noisy, unco-operative and there was evidence of many of

them being under the influence of drink.     Although there were no major ;

problems, it was necessary to arrest   2b   Everton supporters before they

arrived in the Stadium for drink* related offences.




At this stage of the proceedings a series of problem? emerged.      There were a

number of incidents of Everton supporters jumping the turnstiles, in order

 to gain entrance, presumably because they had no tickets.     Furthermore, a

 number of Everton supporters gained entrance in this manner by way of the

 Trinity Road turnstiles, into the Norwich section of the crowd.     Also, it

 was brought to police attention that a number of Evcrton supporters were

 making threats to turnstile attendants in order to gain entrance without

 tickets and some were offering cash as alternative to tickets.     There was

 also an incident requiring police attention in the Stadium ticket office in

 Trinity Road when two persons in possession of tickets for the Liverpool

I am a Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police, attached to Wembley Division.
 My duties include the policing of events at Wembley Stadiim and T have been doing
this in my present rank since January, 1987.

The Hillsborough tragedy, after the initial shock, gave me hope for the tuture.
This hope was that the behaviour of fans in Leppings Lane, which I recognise as
a not unknown tactic at Wembley, would now cease - the danger being acknowledged
by those who indulge in such acts.

On the 20 May I was in charge of the concourse at Wembley Stadiun frcm the Royal
Tunnel round Westwards to Turnstile ’K1. This area has two groups of turnstiles,
*F* and ‘G 1, which are approached by flights of steps and are relatively safe frcni
crushing.   It also has three groups of turnstiles, ’H', 'J' and 'K', approached
by level ground and which are liable to crushing problem s.    The stadium offices
are close to 'H', 'J' and $K' and likewise on level ground.

I saw the first Liverpol supporters on my way into Wembley at Stanmore Broadway,
seme six miles fran the stadium, where a number^were sitting on the pavement drinking
cans of beer or lager, at about 9.30 a.m.

The closer to Wembley, the more fans I saw who were drinking in the street, often
carrying more cans with them.

I arrived at Wembley Stadium at about 10.30 a.m. and saw that a large number of
fans were already on the complex, perhaps as many as 10,000. Again, many or them
had cans of drink, i.e. beer or lager with them. I was dismayed to find that many
of those present did not have tickets for the game. My advice to then to leave
the area went for the most part, unheeded.
On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile 'H' a small section of
fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
cant breach of the fence could be made, giving access to the circulating
corridor.   Fran the enquiries I tirade it appeared that this had been done
by fans during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure at the
right moment to gain ^ntry to the Stadium.

Information was passed to officers under my comnand by an unidentified
Liverpool police officer, that he had heard fans planning to rush the
*H', 'J* and 'K' turnstiles. This confirmed my own view that these were
the most vulnerable areas and therefore the most likely to be attacked.

As time progressed, I noticed that there were more people in that area
suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
This culminated in a number of fights at the ‘pinch point’, the narrowest
point of the concourse, outside the Stadium Offices.       The fights were
caused apparently by tlse aale of tickets by 'touts'. Although well-known
touts were not evident, there seemed to be a number of people selling
one or two tickets.     The fans were keen to attack such people and yet
also to buy the tickets at inflated prices.

By 12.30pm, the crowd was building up generally, but especially so outside
turnstiles 'H', rJ' and 'K'. Because this area is confined, 1 had to
put in a cordon of police horses and foot police between the T.V. compound
and turnstile 'H' to prevent the danger of crushing.

Outside of the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder among fans
who had been drinking and I personally received a blow to the head whilst
assisting one of my officers in making an arrest.

The turnstiles were late in opening because a lorry was stil.l carrying
out seme work in the circulating corridor.    This lorry could only make
an exit through a gate at the side of turnstile ' K ' .  it d.id tiiis just
before 1.15pra but caused quite severe problems with crowds waiting for
the turnstiles to open.   The gate stuck when it was only half open and
a lot of effort was required to prevent a large nuirber of illegal entries
to the Stadium.

Once the turnstiles opened, 1 expected the crowd to ease considerably
and to reduce the complaints of crushing I was getting fran people in
the crowd.   That people were obviously pressing forward and causing a
crush in these circumstances, in the wake of Hillsborough, amazed me.
I was more amazed, however, to find_that the crush was not diminishing
as I expected- it to at turnstile 'H'.   This was because of ticketless
fans forcing their way through the turnstiles with ticket-holders an
having to be removed through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the
operation.

Whilst a lot of illegal entrants were removed, I believe an appreciable
number were not. The most intense crush was at turnstile H , which ha
had a fence weakened during the night, and in my mind must have been pre­
planned by a large nurrber of fans hoping to breach the security of tnc
fence, if they were unable to get in through the turnstiles.

By 2.30pm, the number of people going in .through turnstiles ’H \ 'J' and
'K' had reduced greatly.   This had been achieved by having tickets ror
turnstile 'H* accepted at 'J' and 'K* turnstiles and filtering peop
            at the cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
1           wera reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
            frcm them.    1hey took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks end
            other places, which made it difficult when production was demanded. The
            nurber .of street robberies for this event are much higher than for similar
            events.

16.        Ttere were now sane 350 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
            lave tickets but were still .anxious to find a way into the.Stadmn. Rather
            ■than leaving the cordon as a fixed target, I decided to commence a sweep
            of       concourse,, pushing these fans towards the Fcyal Tunnel and away
           'frcm the -vulnerable area.

17.         When the sweep fran the other side, tuAstiles JA* to *E*, reached the
             Royal Tunnel, the crowd 'which numbered about* 500 began throwing bottles
          ■ arri cans at police. A nunfcer of arrests were made during the ccnpletion
             of the sweep.

18.        Desoite the sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
            during the progress of the game. At about half tirre, there was afetenniii^
           •atteirpt by abcut 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the Stadiun
            Offices and turnstile ’H ’. This was successfully repelled.

    19.    Just beforfe the end of the game, all gates to the Stadiun            qpenea
            in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
            and fans were starting to leave.      However, the equalising goal was then
            scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been
            arri aien those still around the ground without tickets. All managed to
            get into bays around the Stadiixn to watch extra tine.

    20     The number of arrests, 76 on the outside of the stadiun, does not fujly
            reflect the nagnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Rather a balance
            is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
            the nurfcer of police left to control the crowd.

    21.      Cn this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool and Evert*
             supporters.    Had this not been the case, I believe naxh greater
             w c S d have emanated fran the section of fans deteanined to gain entrance

          the initial melee over the events last Saturday has
 subsided a little, I felt it necessary for all sorts of
 reasons, to write a letter of support for you and your Force.

No—one in their right mind can put on one side the nature and
extent of the tragedy with 96 people losing their lives. That
   the outcome of the dreadful events, and I have every
sympathy with the bereaved, with all of those who had to deal
         traumatic events on Saturday, and with all of those
who will be feeling shock and stress in these days after the
events, particularly your Police Officers.

Whst seems to have been disregarded, at least until this
morning's newspapers, is that the cause of the fatalities
undoubtedly was an influx of spectators, many of whom did not
have tickets but were determined at all costs to gain access
to the ground.  I sympathise with the Officer, who faced that
with impossible odds and the threat to life and limb outside
the ground, coming to the decision he did.

^     ^ little time ago when Watford were in the First
Division:   we had an all ticket game for a visit by Liverpool.
Great emphasis was made on local television, radio, and in the
newspapers in the Merseyside area, that those without tickets
would not be admitted to the Watford ground.   In the event,
around 2,000 Liverpool supporters arrived outside the ground
wi nout tickets, created a considerable public order problem,
and were attempting blackmail on my Officers at the time by
indicating that they would cause a great deal of trouble in
the centre of Watford (not far away) if they did not gain
admission to the ground.   It was an impossible situation and
only resolved by consulting with the Watford Club to take most
it not all of them, into the ground.   I am sure others in the

 Dear Mr. Evans,

 With reference to our telephone conversation of today concerning the
 Hillsborough Disaster, as I indicated to you we are currently examining
 the attitudes of Liverpool supporters and experiences of matches prior
 to the semi-final scheduled at Hillsborough.

 There is some indication of large numbers of supporters attending at
 games without tickets, as was the indication at Hillsborough, and I
 understand from our conversation that similar experiences have been
 found within your Police area when Liverpool Football Club have played.
 I have also information that difficulties were experienced at the 1986
 F.A. Cup Final involving Liverpool supporters.

 From our discussions it is clear that you have information which would
 be of considerable assistance, and, if you agree, it would be
 appreciated if a report from an officer involved in the match concerned
 could be forwarded to the South Yorkshire Police Headquarters for
 consideration of introduction as evidence in the Lord Justice Taylor
 Inquiry.

 Due to the timescale of the Inquiry, there is some urgency in this
 matter and it would be helpful, if approval is given for the report(s)
 to be forwarded, that this be faxed to our Headquarters.

 May I take this opportunity of thanking you and your staff for the
 assistance you have already given in this matter.

     urs sincerely


                 I

  LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

  It has occurred to me that in this very difficult and complex
  inquiry you are undertaking on the Hillsborough disaster,
  questions may arise about the antecedent behaviour of Liverpool
  football supporters, particularly at all ticket games.

  I enclose papers which may just be of interest to the Inquiry,
  related to a match which occurred in February 1988 when Liverpool
  came down to play Watford Mid despite all the pre-match warnings,
  1,500 of those fans did not have tickets and caused difficulty
  outside the ground.   It was decided on the day, as a matter of
- expediency, rather than have this un-policed group wandering about
  the nearby centre of Watford, it was safer and easier for them to
  gain admission to ti*e ground.

  The reports I attach are all self-explanatory, and you may take
  the view there is no relevance but at least you should be aware of
  the previous practice of people speculatively coming to venues of
  football matches from Liverpool, which we have not experienced from
  other clubs to such a degree, and their expectation that one way
  or the other they will gain admittance to the ground.

                     I submit this report at the request of D.I. KING of
        Sijuth Yorkshires Police, Hillsborough Incident Room based at Police
        Headquarters, S h effield , Fax. No. 0742 523243. Tho report has been
        requested to a ssist tho Barrister representing Police at the Hillsborough
        Enquiry in connection with the behaviour of Liverpool fans at other all
        ticket matches in recent years.

          i           I have to report that the First Division League match
        between Southampton and Liverpool on Saturday, 24th September, 1900
        w4s an all ticket match and had been advertisod as such.        Pre match
        information was that only 1,700 tickets had been sold to Liverpool
        fans, although tho whole of the Archers Road end {capacity 4,000)
        had been given over to tlioir fans. Cuncern was expressed that a
        large number of Liverpool fans might thurufure turn up without tickots
        a | Liverpool Football Club had only sold tickets to callers at their
        ground and not sent any tickots out by post as a postal strik e was
        taking place at the time.    Plans were therefore made in advanco
        tq ask any fans who arrived without tickots, to queue in Silverdalo
        Rpad, near to the ground so Police could identify the scale of the
            'oblem in terms of fans without tick ets. Such fans wore told that
            ere was no guarantee of them getting in. 150 of those who arrivod
        without tickets chose to queue in this fashion.

                     Near kick off time it was decidod by Superintendent
           KDMPSON that an approach would be made to tho club to open a
         cash turnstile to allow these fans access.

                      The main reasons for this were that:

                      1.    Manpower on the day was limited to G P .S .U .s and
                            tho crowd had exceeded the previous Liverpool
                            fixtures by 3,000 on ticket sa le s, so it was felt
                            that 150 fans wandoring in the town, frustrated
                            at not getting into the match, could have soaked
                            up manpower, which would havo been better
                            committed at the ground,

            .thout tickets chose to queue in this fashion.

                       Near kick off time It was    decided by Superintendent
         THOMPSON that an approach would be made to tho club to open a
         c ls h turnstile to allow these fens access.

                      The main reasons for this were that:

                      1.    Manpower on the day was limited to G P .S .U .s and
                            the crowd had exceeded the previous Liverpool
                            fixtures by 3,000 on ticket sa le s, so it was felt
                            that 150 fans wandoring in the town, frustrated
                            at not getting into the match, could have soaked
                            up manpower, which would have been better
                            committed at the ground.

!         2,    A local couple had booked the Church next
I              to the ground in Archers Road for a wedding at
j              15.30 hours in the mistaken b elief that it was
]              not a match day. They had phoned the Police
|               3 days before requesting assistance to avoid
3              disruption of the serv ice. The presence of 150
?              frustrated fans in the area would not have boon
|              a good start to married life .

j         3.    It was felt that the postal strik e had   frustrated
]              the ’all tickot* systom.

|          The Club Secretary agreed to open a cash       turnstile
Shortly after 35.00 hours and the fans were let in.
]           The Liverpool fans behaved well throughout the match
and there was litt le evidence of drunkoness.  Five Liverpool fans
were ejocted from the ground for breaches of the ground
regulations. Two Liverpool fans were arrested for being drunk
 ind disorderly beforo the match. Two were arrested in tho ground
  or drunkeness. This is       below the average for matches at the
 tell during the 1988-09 season.
            I ask that this report bo Faxed to the Incident Room
fcn the above number for the information of D.I. KING.

           The arrests were for offences of public order, offensive weapon,
           offences relatin g to alcohol, forgery and drugs.

           Ejections were implemented in respect of breaches of ground
           regulations.


           OTHER FACTORS

           This fixture was the first occasion in perhaps the last 25 years mat ar
           almost capacity j^rowd was experienced and brought with it many-
           attendant difficulties.    It was the first time the theoretical
           capacities of th s various parts of the ground, imposed by the Safety
           at Sports Ground s Act, had been tested in practice.

           ground in Liverpool clearly offered alternative facil. ■hi&S to
           the viewing of ttie game by Liverpool supporters and clearly in
           my opinion did much to reduce to a minimum the influx      away
           supporters who w auld otherwise have attempted to gain entry withe
           a ticket.

           The match was de signated ’all ticket’

           In brief the experience  on that day showed that a large number
           of Liverpool fans consumed alcohol prior to their attendance at
           the match.    Soue arrests were made in respect of fans who did in
           fact successful!.y smuggle alcohol into the ground.

           The level of disorder was substantially higher than that experienced
           at other fixtures and borne out by the arrest statistics Liverpool
           fans were the principle instigators of this situation.

           Prior to the match an attempt was made to force entry in the ground
           by Liverpool faip charging an entrance gate.

           Forged tickets were on sale prior to the match and 6 persons were
           arrested for selling such forgeries,

           3 persons were arrested for possessing offensive weapons (baseball
           bats and a kniff blade).

    SUBJECT:           STOKE CITY FC -V- [.TVERPOQj. KC
                       SATURDAY 9TH JANUARY 1989


            1.     I was on duty as Ground Controller at the above match
            which was an FA Cup 3rd round tie.

            2.     It was an all Licket match and Liverpool sold their
            allocation of 7,500 tickets in the Butler Street side of the
            ground (see plan attached). The Liverpool supporters arrived
            in 48 coaches, 31 mini buses, 800 on the train <und the rest by
            private vehicles.

           3.       The total attendance at the match was 31,979. Before the
           mai.cih there were numerous scuffles in the town centre but heavy
           rain for an hour bafore the kick off eased the situation.

                   Information re*ch«d the Control Room that Liverpool
            supporters were in possession of forged tickets and that others
            were buying tickets from touts outside the ground. No
            evidence came to light regarding forged tickets but three ticket
            LuuLs were arrested in streets outside the ground. It appeared
            that they had been selling tickets for Boothen End of the ground
            which is a non membership home supporters standing area.

            5.     Before the kick off five Liverpool supporters were ejected
            from t-.he ground for entering the ground and then passing their
            tickets back over the turnstiles to non ticket holders outside
            the ground.

           6.     As soon as the teams came onto the pitch, it was discovered
           that. 200 - 300 Liverpool supporters had entered the Boothen End
           of the ground reserved for home supporters. It is believed that
           they had obtained tickets from tout.5? before the match. Before
           trouble flared up they were escorted to Butler Street to join
           their own supporters.

           7.    During the match there were few problems except for the
           usual gesticulating between rival supporters.

           8.     At the end of the game the Liverpool supporters were held
           in the ground to enable the surrounding streets to be cleared of
           home supporters. They were not happy about this and it resulted
           in 200 seats being broken in the Butler Street Stand. Seats and
           coins were thrown at Police Officers on the perimeter track.

           9.     After the match there were scuffles in town between opposing
           supporters but no major problems.


                                                                     Cant'd Owriw f I Sheet No.

  Dear Sir

  I refer to the telephone conversation of this date between your
  Superi n t e n d e n t Manns and m y Detective I n s p ector King concerning
  the football matches p l ayed betw e e n Sout h a m p t o n and Liverpool
  City on 12 Dec e m b e r 1987 and 24 S e p tember 1988 .

  It w o u l d be helpful in our enquiries concerning the H i l l sb o r o u g h
  disaster to obtain information of the experiences of the Hampshire
  C o n s ta b u l a r y at those events in dealing wi t h L i ve r p o o l supporters.

 There is some indication of large numbers of supporters attending
 at all ticket matc h e s without tickets. There is c e r tainly some
 evidence of this at H i l l sb o r o u g h and I underst a n d that similar
 experiences were found at the two matches p l ayed at Southampton.

  It is clear from the d iscussion between the two officers that
  information about the two matches w o ul d be of considerable a s s i s ­
  tance and, if you agree, it w o u l d be a p p r e c i a t e d if reports from
  Superi n t e n d e n t Manns and C h i e f I n s pector McWhirter, the two
  officers able to supply the information, could be f o r warded to
  the South Y or k s h i r e Police Headquarters.

 Due to the timescale of the Public Inquiry, there is some urgency
 in this m a t t e r and it w o u l d be a p p r e c i a t e d ,if a p proval is given
 for the reports to be forwarded, if they could be faxed to our
 Headquarters.

 May I take this o p p ortunity of t hanking you for yo u r assistance
 in this matter.

 Yours faithfully

              As requested, I                    below details in relation to the above
              fixture

              Match Cotoraander                      - Superintendent R WRIGHT, BK Sub Division
              Total Police Strength                  - 372 regular officers
                                                     - 25 Special Constabulary

              Crowd Attendanoe                        -     19,893 (approx 4,500 Liverpool)

              Arrests                                 -     36 (26 Liverpool fans, 10 home fans)

              Ejections                               -     7 (2 Liverpool fans, 5 home fans)


              Average number of arrests per match throughout the season
              (excluding Liverpool) = 0.7 or = 1 arrest/8600 spectators.

              Hie arrests were for offences of public order, offensive weapon,
              offences relating to alcohol, forgery and drugs.

              Ejections were implemented in respect of breaches of ground
              regulations.


              OTHER FACTORS

              Ihis fixture was the first occasion in perhaps the last 25 years that an
              almost capacity srowd was experienced and brought with it many
              attendant diffic ilties.  It was the first time the theoretical
              capacities of ths various parts of the ground, imposed by the Safety
              at Sports Grounds Act, had been tested in practice.

              A live televisio 1 link to a giant screen at the Tranmere Rovers
              ground in Liverp aol clearly offered alternative facilities for
              the viewing of tfte game by Liverpool supporters and clearly in
              ay opinion did muc.h to reduce to a minimum the influx of away
              supporters who W31iuld otherwise have attempted to gain entry without
              a ticket.

              The match was designated 'all ticket’.




H 0 0 •39dd                                      oh       3 D i “i cd   aaisaaewriH    wo*d    03 : I I :6 « Nflf 8
               -2-
               In brief the ex jerience on that day showed that a large number
               of Liverpool fails consumed alcohol prior to their attendance at
               the match,   Softe arrests were made in respect of fans who did in
               faot successful y smuggle alcohol into the ground.

               The level of disorder was substantially higher than that experienced
               at other fixtures and borne out by the arrest statistics Liverpool
               fans were the pi'inciple instigators of this situation.

               Prior to the mai eh an attempt was made to force entry in the ground
               by Liverpool fsuus charging an entrance gate.

               Forged tickets irere on sale prior to the match and 6 persons were
               arrested for selling such forgeries.

               3 persons were arrested for possessing offensive weapons (baseball
               bats and a knife blade).

               Below is a summary of events extracted from the match log on
               that day:-
                               i
               1025   60 Liverpool fans arrive on first service train and
                       disperse Iinto City Centre (approximately 300 in total
                       travelled by service train).

               1131   3 eoachei of Liverpool supporters arrive at the Hull Rugby
                      League Football Club ground and disperse to pubs/clubs.

               1150   2 Liverpool fans arrested at coach intercept point in
                      possession of baseball bats.    (Alcohol also found on board
                      this bus]

               1235   Report of a fight outside the ground.

               1244   First report of existence of forged tickets received.

               1255/ Further reports of forged tickets resulting in s i x
               1320 Liverpool supporters being arrested for selling forgeries.

               1345   Report oft Liverpool fans urinating in street near to the
                      ground.

               1350   Report of Liverpool fans stealing from the Club shop at

       All coaches, m i n i- b u s e s a nd vans were i n t e r c e p t e d on the A 63 Ferriby
       by-pass.      Coaches were esc o r t e d to the g r o u n d to u n l o a d and then parked
       o n the H u m b e r Brid g e car park.   M i n i - b u s es a n d vans w e r e p a rked on the
       front' car park.

       The   front car park at the g r ou n d was kept clear and home supporters were
       prevented      from entering.

       A f t e r the m a t c h B oo t h f e r r y Road was closed b e t w e e n Ke n n i n g s Roundabout and the
       N o r t h Road junction.           North Road became a o n e - w a y stre e t run n i n g north from
       B o o t h f e r r y Road to Anlaby Road, and south from B o o t h f e r r y Road to Hessle Road.
       All c o a c he s we r e parked on B o o t h f e r r y Road at the end of the m atch to enable
       a c o n t a i n ed l o a d i n g of supporters.

       A d d i t i o n a l p u blic order patr o l s covered the city centre and met service trains
       as they arrived.

       A spec i a l t r a i n was or g a n i s ed to pick up rail p a s s e ng e r s from the ground after
       the match.       It did not a r r i v e until a f t e r the release of the vi s it i n g supporters
       and ve r y few b o a r de d it.

       The m a j o r i t y of rail p a ss e n g e r s were ferried in d o u b l e d e c k e r buses to and from
       the r a i l w a y station.

       M o s t P u b l i c Houses   in the v i c i n i t y closed their doc-rs and m o n i t o r e d persons
       e n t e r i n g v i a ba c k door.

Report on selected sound track from video compilation re the Hillsborough
Semi-Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest on the 15 April 1989
(T S U Reference 697).



L.     The section selected was approx 50 seconds duration and consisted
       of crowd noise outside Lepping's Lane prior to the start of the
       match.

       The intention was to enhance the audio recording to enable
       certain snatches of conversation to be identified.

       On receipt, the T S U found that it was not possible to
       isolate the particular sections as required due to the
       limitations of our equipment.  It was, however, attempted to
       compile ak incomplete transcript of the various broken phrases
       from a number of sources within the crowd.   It is our opinion
       that the selected section had itself been previously edited
       from the original source - thus impairing the continuity of
       speech and thus inhibiting intelligible interpretation.

2.     If it is required that the matter be pursued any further, T S U
       would recommend that, first and foremost: the original
       continuous recording of the scene should be located (I understand
       from the B B C ) and the sound lifted directly from this. Secondly;
        that the matter be passed to the Home Office Scientific Research
        and Development Branch at Sandridge where their more sophisticated
        equipment and the necessary expertise would be available.

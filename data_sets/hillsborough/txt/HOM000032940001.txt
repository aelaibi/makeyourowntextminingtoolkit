Thank you for your faxed letter of 7 March enclosing a copy of one dated
24 December about the tragic events at Hillsborough and the calls for the inquiry
to be reopened. I am sorry that you did not receive a reply to your earlier letter
which I am afraid that we have been unable to trace.

I would like to say first of all how saddened I was by this terrible disaster. In
the House of Commons, I gave an undertaking to consider carefully the
representations that have been made to reopen the public inquiry. I emphasised
that I would not take the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to
be convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so.

I explained that in coming to a decision I would consider whether there is any
new evidence, and, if so, whether that evidence appeared to be of such
significance that had it been put before Lord Taylor or the coroner, either the
outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
different.

I will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as I have been
able to consider all the issues. Meanwhile, I would like you to know that my
thoughts will be with you and all the bereaved families.

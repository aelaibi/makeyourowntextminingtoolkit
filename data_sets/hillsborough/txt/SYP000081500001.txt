              I am a single man and I reside at the above address with my two

              sisters.

              Qn Saturday,        15th April this year                  (150489)     I went td H i l l sb or ou gh ,

              Sheffield,       to the F .A. Cup semi final between Liverpool and Notts.

              Forest.      I travelled to the game with three lads one was my nephew
                 fiC *    /T \                     I T P f f L U l fl/sy/
                                and his two friends Ian ana'Joseph G L O V E R . I knew Ian

              to say he Mo        to, but I had never m e t                    his brother Joe.      The three    lads

              met me at my house,              I had got two tickets,                one from my season ticket

              and one from my friends season ticket,                             mine was for the No r^n Stand

              and the other ticket which I gave to                                   was for the West Stand,           the

               other two lads had ground tickets for the Leppings LN. We j U f t ^ lfy

              house in my car at about                   11.00                   h rs ) and set off

               for Sheff ieJkfT'we didn't stop on the way but we did get held up in

traffic in the /syfckport area.          We arrived i^iaheffield at about           1.55

pm (1355) and parked the car on a main road it would be the A 6 1 6 ,

about one mile north west of Hillsborough fo ot ba 11 g r o u n d .

We started to walk to the ground straight a w a y , I saw some police

officers directing traffic on route and we just followed the crowd

along the road, although I knew whi ch which way to go as I at,ten,
                    X                    ttlS 'Q c c r i d s
the same fixture l^Tt y e a r.       We arrived at the Leppings LN turnstiles

at about £.15 ptrr <1415 h r s ) and the re was a fair size c rowd

congregating outside but I saw no disorder or drunkeness                 infact I

can *t recall seeing anybody drinking although I ’m sure people were.

As soon as we arrived at the t i ^ r p & t i 1es I took my 1e a v ^ / r o m

Ian and Joe and they headed in the direction of the turnstiles for the

West Stand and the terrace,         because it was only 2.15 pm (1415 hrs) had

a walk round for about ten minutes,           I returned at about 2.25 pm (1425)

having walked up to the roundabout at Penistone Road.                 When I returned

at about 2.25 pm (1425 hrs)         vast numbers of people were arriving at

the ij^oapi ngs Lane entrance,      I went immediately to the North Stand

turnstile and joined the q u e u e ’s to enter the ground,

There were police officers at the entrances to the turnstile frisking

people as they entered infact I was frisked myself the relationship

between the police and fans was very good humoured and people were

laughing and joking with the Police.

I entered the ground w ith no problem at all and took my seat in the

stand straight away,          I was situated at the back of the stand and right

in the middle about level with the half way line.

When I took my seat w hich would have b e e n ^.2.35 pm (1435 hr/S~)           it was

immediately obvious that there was considerable overcrowding                  in the

area directly behind the goal          in the j_,eppi rigat LN W r r a c e , the area

beneath the large balcony and adjacent to the Police control box was

at this stage only half full,          I coul dn’t help wondering why people
                                                                          PAGE       3
                                                                          S2376

w e r e n ’t occupying this space and even as the game started the latter

area was still only about two thirds full.

Shortly after the game had started I was aware of fans climbing out o f

the area behind the goal over the perimeter fence and onto the track

round the pitch,    I realised immediately that they were doing this to

escape from a dangerous situation.

I remained in my seat for about twenty minutes feeling irritated that

the game had been interrupted and 1 wanted the people to get off the

pitch not knowing the extent of the tragedy at this time.            It w a s n ’t

until   I saw youngsters breaking up the boardings to be used as

stretchers,    then 1 realised the seriousness of the situation and that

something exceptional had happened.

The first   indication I had that people had been killed was when I

spoke to a tea and coffee lady at about 3.30 pm (1530)          she was crying

and told me that two people had died,        I went back and sat down and I

heard somebody else say seven people had been killed,          by this time it

was pretty obvious to me that the game would be abandonned so I left
                                                             r jl'f
the stand and on my way out I met a friend of mine named

who told me fourteen people had died and he indicated to me it was as

the result of a gate being opened,        1 made my way out of the ground

and went and stood at the junction of Leppinqs LN and Middlewood RD

to wait to see if I could find any of the three lads,          I remained there

till about 4.45 pm (1643)      but d i d n ’t see see any of them.   1 would

like to say that the attitude of the fans had changed,          that is some

of the fans,    not all,   of them,   toward the police, a few fans were

hurling abuse at the police accusing them for what had happened.               I

went back to my car which was a mile up Middlewood Rd to see if they

had gone back,    but there was no sign of them so 1 left a note on

the windscreen and returned to the ground getting back about 5.45 pm

most    people had disappeared by this time.      I explained the situation

to a policeman about the three/lads 1 was looking for and he advised

me to go to a temporary incident office at the far end of the North

Stand that is the Hop E no f   When I got there I gave the three names to

an officer, and when I mentioned the name of lan G L O V E R , the officer

appeared to have this name on his list and he said that people had

been enquiring about Ian.      This officer told me to take a special bus

that was outside and go to a certain police station that was about a

mile from the ground but in the other direction from my car,         1 gave

details of the boys at the police station,        and next door to the police

station there was a community centre and I gave details to the soc ial

workers there,    everybody was very helpful   but I still d i d n ’t have any

knowledge of where the boys were and because of this reason I co ul d n’t

phone home.

I sat there chatting with the social workers for about one and a half

hours, and around 7.30 pni (1930) a number of people started arriving

from Liverpool and at this time 1 was aware of the full extent of the

tragedy when 1 was told by a social worker that over ninety people had

been killed.     When I heard a lady crying uncontrolable     in the hall     I

decided 1 would have to find out something and the clergyman in charge

of the hall took me to his office and allowed me to use his

phone,   I rang home and my sister informed me that            and Joe were

OK but in hos pi tal and unfortunately Ian had been kjj. led,

A social worker drove me to the Sheffield Northern General,        her name

was                   I saw my nephew there,   he had minor injuries but he

was well enough to go home.      I waited with_         at the hospital

until his relatives arrived and then we all drove home together

arriving home at about 0300 am (0300).

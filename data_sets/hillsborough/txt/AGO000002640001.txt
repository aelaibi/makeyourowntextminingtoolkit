Dear Mr Brummell

Hillsborough Public Inquiry

I refer to my telephone discussion with you on 12 November 1999. As advised we
currently act for Mr David Duckenfield, the former Chief Superintendent of South
Yorkshire Police who was in control of the police operation at the Hillsborough football
disaster on 15 April 1989. Mr Duckenfield is currently facing a private prosecution for
manslaughter in relation to two of the deaths that occurred at Hillsborough.

As part of the defence that is being mounted on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, we intend
making a challenge to the admissibility of the evidence given by Mr Duckenfield at the
Taylor Inquiry. We are concerned that Mr Duckenfield gave evidence to that Inquiry
without the benefit of independent legal advice and without the knowledge of matters raised
in a Salmon letter addressed to Messrs Hammond Suddards, the solicitors acting for the
South Yorkshire Police at that time. As part of our investigation into this matter we have
taken statements from Mr Justice Andrew Collins QC, lead counsel to the Taylor Inquiry,
Mr William Woodward QC, lead counsel instructed by Messrs Hammond Suddards on
behalf of the South Yorkshire Police and Mr Peter Whitehurst, your assistant solicitor to the
Inquiry. To complete the picture we would very much like to meet with you to interview
you with a view to preparing a statement for signature by you in relation to the issue of the
distribution of Salmon letters and all related matters. To assist you with your recollection of
events at that time I enclose for your information a copy of the Salmon letter in question
together with a draft of the statement we have prepared for Mr Peter Whitehurst. Matters
that we would be seeking to discuss with you are similar in vein to those contained in Mr
Whitehurstâ€™s statement.

I request that you consider the material attached together with any other material you have
in your possession (and I note that your assistant Kim has extracted from your archives
documentation relating to this matter) and that you contact me to discuss matters further
with a view to arranging a time for us to meet. Please note that I will be in Bristol until

              regarding           the       fans    and    security             procedures.

             We      left    the      ground        and    began          p at r o l        by    11am      (1100).      My   serial        was

here       were a number                  of     calls       to    various          licensed          premises              where       drunken

fighting            had       occurred.             Supporters           were       drinking          alcohol            on    the      street

outside            licensed          premises.             On     the w h o l e      the       behaviour             wa s     good.       We    di d

not      have       to a r r e s t        any       person.

I did         not       see    any Liverpool                 fans       during       our       p a t rol.       They were

approaching               the       ground          from     the     opposite            direction.

At     3 p m we w e r e            parked        on a s id e         roa^K^pproximately                        half      a mile         from

the      ground.          There          was     a great          deal    of    radio          traffic          tr&i'ii g r o u n d

control.            I can          remember          t h e "csqritro 11 er s         voice          becoming           more        intense

and      then       I         heard       h i m sa y      ' s top tjhem g e t t i n g          onto        the       p i t c h ’ . At     that

stage         I can       remember               putting          on my      gloves           thinking          there         was going        to

be a       great         deal       of    trouble.          Within        a minute             or    so    1 heard            ’O p e r a t i o n

Support*            c al led.        I realised             then        that    the       s it u a t i o n was           very       serious.

We     immediately                 drove       to    the    ground        leaving             the    Transit           on a        central

reservation               directly             opposite           the m a i n       entrance.             I went         to    the      corner

of     the      north         stand       and       the    Cop,     the      main        entrance          to    the        field.        At

t hi s     stage         1 was       not       aware       of     any    real       trouble.          A    colleague             walked

past       me      and    said       ’A n d y       t h e r e ’s a b o u t     18    de a d' .

1 can         remember             thinking          at    that     stage       we       could       be    involved            in a       really

big      publicorder                problem and             1      started          to    feel       frightened.               I

ran to          the           pitch and looke d                 up to    the    Leppings             Lane        end.       Al l I c o u l d

se e     were       hundreds             of    people        running         onto        the    p i t c h ""a-qd m i x e d w i t h             them

Wallace            shouted          ’F o l l o w me*        to al'lN.the o f f i c e r s              who       were        close       to     him.

We     were        led    o n to     the       pitch and           lined       up    in f r o n t         of    the N o r t h        Stand.

The      f an s     in t h i s       stand          began       shouting        at       us    to    go a n d        help      the      people

at     th e     Leppings            LAne       end.        As     I looked          I could          see m o r e         and       more

people          lyi ng        on    the       pitch.        D e s pi te      be i ng      told       to    hold        pos i t i on       in

Together       with a number                 o                cers we w e n t             to

and    began    to       help     them       from         the    pitch         to    the a m b u l a n c e         s t a t i o n at          the

side    of    the    gymnasium.                  I can        remember           helping          at    l e a st      three        people

in t h i s    was,       either        carrying            them       on m y        shoulders           or    on m a k e s h i f t

stretchers.              I did       not     know        th e    names         of    these        p e op l e.         They were              all

left    in the        care      of    th e       medical         personnel             behind          the    North          Stand.

1 was       aware    of a n u m b e r            of L i v e r p o o l       f an s     on      the     pitch who             were

shouting       and       swearing           at    me.         1 ignored             them.         1't w a s     neither            the       time

nor    the    place       to m a k e        arrests           although           their         behaviour           w as      so

obviously       contrary             to m a n y         public        order         offences.

As    the    casualties          were        cleared            from     the        pit c h,      police        and       fans         mingled

together.           At    one     stage          1 was        aware      of      some       trouble          n e ar    to     the       Kop

and    did    see    a serial           go       into      the       South       Stand.           I did       not      pa y m u c h

attention.           I wa s       exhausted              and     shocked.

We    seemed    to       be    standing           on     the     pitch         for     an      eternity.              T he    crowd was

becoming       restless          and        there        had     been       no      indication           of w h a t          was       to

happen,       other       than       t he    Liverpool               manager         Kenny        Dalaleish            maki.nq a

short       statement          over     the       public         address            system.            1 did       not       hear       any

radio       message       from       ground           control.

Eventually          at a r o u n d      4pm       the      m at ch was           abandoned.              1 made           my w a y          b ac k

outside       through          the m a i n        entrance            o nt o     Penistone             Road     and       guided            the

Nottingham          fans       from     the       ground         to    their         respective              coach an d            trains.

They    were    very          subdued.            I saw         no    trouble          at      all.

My    serial    were          reunited           at    th e     Transit          van      together           with      two        or    three

officers       from       other       serials.                Inspector             Wallace          joined        us a n d        we       were

directed       to    resume mob i l e                 pa t r o l .     We      were       directed           to a. n u m b e r          a

small       public       order       incidents             and       finally         to     the      Northern General

Hospital       where          Liverpool           fans        were     becoming             upset       with       reporters.                  The

situation       was       resolved           by a n        Inspector             from another                serial.

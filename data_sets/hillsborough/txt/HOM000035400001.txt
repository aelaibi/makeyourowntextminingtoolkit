We spoke earlier. I am grateful to you for offering to send us a copy
o f the draft o f the Support Group’s submission to Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith. We accept that this will be without prejudice to whatever the
Group may say in the final version o f its submission. But it would
plainly help from our point o f view if thatfinal version could be with
us fairly soon.


I attach a copy o f a letter from South Yorkshire police about the
report by Mr Phillips. They are unwilling to release it for the
reasons they explain. As I said, having now read the report myself I
do not think that it contains anything which could be regarded as new
evidence.

I hope this is helpful.

  Dear Mr [

  Hillsborough Scrutiny

^^'n a n k you for your letter of 6 August 1997 which I received on 8 August 1997.

  I have made arrangements for the Phillips report to be supplied to you. I have reservations
  about making it available to a wider audience. The report was commissioned by the (then)
  Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police in anticipation of civil actions against the Force.
  We have appointed Winckworth Pemberton to provide legal advice to us on the Scrutiny. I
  will ask Mr OWSTON to advise me on whether the release of the Phillips report to Ms
  Adlington would compromise issues of confidentiality.

  I have a similar reservation about the release of the report which the Chief Constable
  provided to the Home Secretary before the General Election. Again I will ask for advice
  from our solicitors.

  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, you and your staff are entitled to unrestricted access to our store
  of material. I am happy to supply material to other people but not if it breaches the privacy
  of others or if the material is confidential, for instance legal advice.

  I will turn now to the issues raised by Ms Ann Adlington, solicitor for the Hillsborough
  Families Support Group. In her letter to you, dated 5 August 1997, she says she is
  “extremely concerned at their (South Yorkshire Police) delaying tactics” in supplying the
  statements of two named individuals. Ms Adlington wrote to us on 17 July 1997 asking for
  some statements. I wrote to you on 23 July to ask permission of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
  to release material. On 30 July 1997 you wrote to say that it was in order to release any
  material we deemed fit to release. Your letter arrived on Friday 1 August 1997. I was out
  of the office that day and acted upon it on Monday 4 August. I do not think this can be
  construed as “delaying tactics”. Please feel free to copy all this letter to Ms Adlington if you
  wish.

  Yours sincerely




  Ian Daines
  Assistant Chief Constable

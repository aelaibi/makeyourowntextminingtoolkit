Dear Mr Sawers
You raised a query yesterday concerning the implementation of Operation
Support on 15 April in connection with the events at Hillsborough.
Firstly, the requirement in the Operation Support Plan for dedicated use of
Radio Channel No 2 was already satisfied by the sole use of the channel for
the Hillsborough Semi-final operation.    Please see previous statements by
Chief Inspector Edmundson and communications staff regarding radio channel
arrangements for the day.
The requirement to change the Command and Control status of personnel
r e s p o n d i n g t o O p e r a t i o n Support to "09" was presumably actioned by
Sub-Divisional Controls.                 That requirement is an essential part of the
pre-formatted message relating to Operation Support which was transmitted by
Operations Room to all Sub-Divisions. A copy of the format is attached and
Chief Inspector Edmundson's statement will relate to the sending of the
message.
Unfortunately, the "Status" facility on the Command and Control System is
dynamic in the sense that the data base is overwritten by subsequent
i n f o r m a t i o n a n d it is therefore not possible to retrieve historical
information in printed form.
I trust that this letter will suffice to answer the query rather than the
formal preparation of further statements on this seemingly procedural point.
Yours sincerely_ _ _ _

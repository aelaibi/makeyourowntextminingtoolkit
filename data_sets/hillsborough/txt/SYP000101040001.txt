Police Constable 2910



At   8.30   a.m.   Saturday    15 April   1989    I commenced duty     at Main      Street    Police

Station,     Rotherham   for    duties    in    relation   to   the   FA   Cup    Semi   Final       at

Hillsborough, Sheffield.

I was     shown on the order as being          in Serial   36 under the command of PS 1829

France.     Our Serial comprised almost totally E Group officers from Main Street.

Transport was laid on at Rotherham and we were taken to Hillsborough arriving at

about 9.15a.m.      We went into the North Stand for briefing which started at about

10.00 a.m.

From my position it was difficult              to hear some of what was          being said but I

subsequently referred to match orders to verify the instructions given to me.

We then had our snack of crips etc and went out on patrol shortly afterwards.

Our Serial, together with Serial 37 were deputed to go to Wadsley Bridge Station

to escort the Liverpool supporters arriving by train to the ground. We arrived at

about 11.00 a.m. at the station and all went onto the platform out of the way. We

were told shortly afterwards by Chief Inspector Purdy that this was not allowed

and so we had to go and stand about in the side road next to the station from

11.00 a.m. until the train arrived.             I was surprised to find that only 1 train

was due and that was scheduled for 2.02 p.m.               This meant that 22 officers were

standing around killing time for 3 hours doing absolutely nothing.

Whilst at our point awaiting the train, I spoke to several supporters mostly from

Liverpool who were walking away from the ground. They basically would not turn

around when asked, and continued up Halifax Road.

Numerous of these had cans of beer with them although to begin with they did not

appear drunk.       I also spoke to several people who were with family who wanted

food and directions to the ground.              One family consisted of 2 men and a young

boy. The boy's father had a home made stand for his son to use inside the ground

but shortly before     I had heard a message   stating that milk crates were to be

banned in the ground. As this stand had obviously had some care taken into its

construction,    I advised the father to return it to the car to avoid losing it.

This he did. As he was doing this I was talking to his son and the other man who

were both eating chips and fish.     I asked if I could have one, and then we spent

the next 10 minutes eating these and having a good laugh.     On the father's return

I gave them directions to the Liverpool end of the ground where they had tickets.

By now due to the hot weather I was beginning to feel very hot, but no drinks

were available nearby.

The influx of supporters both on foot and in vehicles was gradually increasing

and it was noticable that lots of the pedestrians had with them 4 packs of beer

etc and the noise level was increasing.

Superintendent Marshall arrived at our location some time around 1.00 p.m. and

spoke to us. As he was at our location a radio message was received that a group

of supporters were causing problems at the rear of Halfords Store on Kilner Way.

Mr Marshall and several of our serials went up to the location and I saw the

Gateway Supermarket appeared to have closed the entrance doors. Coming from the

exit   door were   numerous males with cans    of beer under their arms,   1 youth I

remember had what appeared to be a pack of 12 cans or bottles of beer/lager in a

green covering and he was already drinking one of these as he left the store.

The problem outside Halfords was sorted a short time later and we returned to the

station.    I was surprised to see so many youths etc sat on the grassed area

outside Halfords drinking. The grass was covered in cans and bottles as we walked

through the crowd. A short time later, at about 2.00 p.m. the train arrived and

we lined up by the steps as the fans got off. Mounted officers had by this time

arrived, and we stopped the fans until all were off the station and in a large

but manageable     group.   I together with several other officers searched random

fans as they left the station and this was received with a good deal of fun and

amusement by the supporters.

The procession then set off and I found myself in a good natured bit of banter

with several of the supporters who seemed to think the whole thing was a huge

joke.     No nastiness at all.

I must say now that up to this point I thought everything was going quite well

and we seemed to be winning over the supporters we were talking to by having a

laugh and a joke and it seemed to be paying off.

The     supporters    were    taken      to   the   ground   without    incident    and    taken    to    the

turnstiles.      I found that traffic was still running along Leppings Lane which

seemed daft as it was only adding to the congestion.                         At the elbow of the road

right outside the ground, the situation was so bad that I went into the road and

began to work traffic and pedestrian control off my own bat, because people were

milling everywhere and someone was going to get hurt before much longer.                             Buses

were trying to plough through and the situation was tense.

I sorted out the initial problem and went back onto the footpath on the opposite

side of the road from the ground where I saw dozens of people just hanging round

drinking and sitting on the wall. These would not move towards the ground when

asked.     In other words we were wasting our time talking to them.                       It also became

apparent that lots of people and I mean lots were looking for tickets.                               I was

asked myself,        and anyone who was sat on the wall or standing nearby, was asked

about tickets.

The crowd outside the ground was growing to such an extent that it was beginning

to swell onto the roadway from the forecourt.                   I decided to go in among them and

see what the problem was because there appeared to be no recognised queues. PC

25^7 Ramsden     from Serial          37 went with me, and we went into the centre of the

crowd. We were immediately swamped by people wanting to know where to go.                                They

had tickets, but could still not find out where to go. This raised a point as far

as    I was   concerned      in   that    the   signs   above   the    turnstiles   were    found    to be
                                                                                                                PAGE 4

totally inadequate. They are too small for people to read until they are 10 yards

away from the turnstiles and by that time if they found they were in the wrong

section of the crowd,          they faced an almost impossible task to swop to another

part of the crowd where they should have been.

The tickets were coloured so why not put up very large signs measuring 10 feet x

5 feet or something similar, with arrows pointing down to the turnstiles, painted

in the same colours as the tickets.                   This would have stopped all or most of the

problems with people wandering around causing problems merely by their presence.

It was as I was directing people that a young lad came up to me and asked if I

could help get his friend into the ground.                      His friend and he had tickets for the

North Stand and his           friend was in a wheelchair.                  I pushed my way through the

crowd assisted by another officer who I think was PC 2403 Morton and made a path

through    the   crowd    through      which        the   2    lads   passed.         I     then       banged   on     the

concertina style gate and 2 stewards opened this up and the boys were admitted.

The gate was then shut.

As I made my way back to the forecourt I was confronted by a man of about 35-^0

who was nearly hysterical.             He was accompanied by a woman and an older gentleman

and they had tickets for the North Stand.                      He began shouting about how crushed he

was and how badly organised things were, and generally how he was appalled by the

whole situation.         He   insisted that I open               the concertina gate again to admit

everyone with a North Stand ticket and to stop the crush.                                       I explained to him

that this was not possible at that time. With this he became very agitated and I

informed him that if he felt so strongly about the situation that he should write

to the FA, the football club and the Chief Constable on his return home to make

his feelings known. This he said he would do.                          He then stormed off back to the

queues    and    the   lady    with    him    asked       me    to    forgive       him    as    he     was    upset    by

everything.       I spoke      to     the    lady    for about        2 minutes           and    she    then    left    me

thanking me for my help.

The crush for the 5 North Stand turnstiles was by now getting very bad.                                 I went

and took up a position against the wall of the sweet shop where the forecourt of

the ground joins it.           My back was to the wall and the crowd were pressing up to

me, passing from right to left in front of me.                        On several occasions I had to

speak to young men who were just pushing into the backs of people and surging and

being bloody daft.

I don't know what time it was by now, some time between 2.30 pm and 3.00 p.m. I

realised that things were getting totally out of hand. Where I was I was having

to pull young lads and their fathers out of the crush due to the youngsters being

crushed and feeling faint. One young lad I had to literally put my foot into the

crowd to force a space before pulling the lad out with one arm and holding him to

me whilst he came round.                His father pushed his way out also and then I got them

out of the crush and onto the footpath outside the shop.                          I also saw grown men

coming out of the crush pale faced and one in particular was saying "fucking mad,

I've   had enough      of    that,       they're   fucking mad."       He stood beside me until he

regained a bit of his colour and got his breath back before going out of the

forecourt    and   out      onto       Leppings    Lane   to wait    for   the   crush   to stop.       I can

remember a lady of about 50 wearing a fawn overcoat who was crying due to being

crushed.     She was crushed with her head facing me and could not even turn her

head forwards due to the pressure she was under. She shouted to me 'help me I'm

going to faint.'         I pushed into the crowd and got hold of her coat by the front

and the left shoulder and pulled her towards me through the crowd.                              Once my back

was to the sweet shop wall I pulled the woman to me as she had lost nearly all

her colour and held her to me with my arms round her until she regained a bit of

composure.       I then stood her beside me to my right so that her back was against

the shop wall.         I don't know what happened to her then as I was getting crushed

myself by this time,          as the crowd swelled and became intent on forcing a way

through     to   the   turnstiles.            I    looked   around    me   at    this    time    and    I   saw

Superintendent Marshall stood on a brick wall to my right next to the river.              He

was talking into his radio and I caught a message through my radio about opening

a gate before a      'catastrophe'   happens.    I do not know if Mr Marshall was the

person who used this phrase however.

From what I could see the situation was chaotic all around the area. People were

pushing, chanting, singing and the position was useless from a control point of

view.    Young men    were   actually   climbing over   the wall     above   the West Stand

seating turnstiles and into the ground.          By now people were getting hysterical

around me both male and female and begging for help.         I decided that someone was

going   to get    seriously hurt     in the   crush before   much longer,     and   there was

nothing anyone    could do to stop trouble happening.         (By trouble I mean someone

being crushed).   The situation was literally out of control.

I made a decision to seek advice regarding opening the concertina door leading to

the North Stand to allow people         to just rush through the larger opening,          and

possibly save life as that's how bad I thought it was.             I tried 3 times on my

radio to contact ground control but received no answer.            I then tried to contact

Superintendent Marshall via talk-through 3 further times to ask his permission to

open the gate.     I again received no reply.        I then pushed my way through the

forecourt of the ground and across to where Mr Marshall was.                 I then spoke to

him, told him     about the crush and asked permissionto open the concertina gate.

He said "Yes go on Gary."        I then pushed my way back through the crowd to the

gate and banged on it.       The stewards appeared at the windows and told them to

open the gate up and let the crowd in before someone was killed. This they did

after I had repeated myself.

Immediately the crowd surged forward to this gate and went through.             The pressure

eased within 30 seconds but still people were pushing and I admit that I took

hold of 2 young idiots of about 17-18 years who were just going wild to get in,

knocking people everywhere. The whole mentality seemed to be not to miss the kick
                                                                                     PAGE 7

off at any price.      It was frightening.    I bollocked the 2 lads and then let them

go. To be quite honest I was sweating like a dog and was physically tired due t

all the pushing, shoving etc, plus the warm weather and having to wear tunics in

hot weather.       I was shattered to be frank.         I was wiping myself down with my

handkerchief as I heard a radio message to the effect that all officers were to

go onto the perimeter at the Leppings Lane end.             I ran into the ground by the

gate I'd just opened and then under the North Stand.              I ran up through the first

gangway and into the stand itself.      I saw the Liverpool players trooping off the

pitch on the other side of the ground from me and then I saw the Leppings Lane

Terrace (from now on called the LLT).        There were people all over it, bobbies and

civilians.     I ran down the steps, over the wall, over the advertising hoardings

and onto the pitch.      I ran to the fence and stood on the wall.          The first thing

that struck me was the noise, a mixture of squeals and shouts.              Next the smell,

you could smell beer strongly.      I saw how crushed things were in the pen and my

first instinct was to climb up the fence and jump           into the pen to       help, butas I

began climbing up I realised that I'd land on someone inside and hurt them, so I

stopped where I was and tried to kick, pull and tug the fence down.             I even threw

myself at it shoulder to wire to try and knock it down but of course nothing

happened.     People were screaming for help only 18 inches away on the other            side

of the line but I couldn't do a bloody thing.           Then bodies and injured came     over

the top and the first person I saw was shaken and totally out of breath.               I laid

him down on the pitch and asked him what hurt etc, but he was only shaken up.                 I

obtained     his   details   as                   124    years,

Liverpool.     I'm not sure but he could have hurt his right ankle.          I helped to get

him over to the advertising hoardings at the North Stand side of the pitch and

left him there with his mate or a man who said he'd help I can't remember which.

I then turned back to the stand LLT and it was awful.              I walked towards it and I

saw a limp figure passed over the fence.           I got this body onto the pitch and
                                                                                              PAGE 8

began mouth to mouth and cardiac massage with a young girl from the St John's

Ambulance who seemed totally shocked but did a good job.                       A man in a Liverpool

shirt then came to me and he had a green stretcher.                   He asked if it was any use

and I said "yes."         We loaded this young man onto the stretcher and then we ran

the length of the pitch as fast as we could to the first aid post at the back of

the stand but when we got there a nurse told us he was dead and to take him into

the gym.      This we did.       I then went back to the LLT and we fetched out 2 people,

a man and a young lad who were injured but alright. These we dumped at the first

aid room and ran back. I realised at this point that I'd lost my helmet.                           Funny

how you think of things like that at such a time.

Me and the Liverpool lad were running back to the LLT with the stretcher again

when I saw 4 lads carrying another lad on a board.                    They were saying "Help us."

I saw that the lad on the board was blue in the face and his eyes were half open.

He looked about        18-19-    I said       "Come on I'll   show you where       to go."        I then

grabbed part of the board they were carrying and we ran to the first aid room.                         A

man looked at the youth and said "Sorry it's too late." and moved on.                             I knew

where to take the body but the board wouldn’t go through the door, so I picked

the body up in my arms and carried it into the gym and laid him down.                             No one

seemed to know what was happening and so I ran back out and back towards the LLT.

The next person I helped was a young woman who was totally shaken and I sat her

down at the pitch side.

I'd stopped getting details as things were well out of control by now and names

and addresses were the last thing on my mind.

One   thing    that    I do     remember was      that   throughout    all   the   chaos   that    Chief

Superintendent        Nesbit    was   doing    a brilliant    job,    he was    everywhere   at once,

fantastic.

I then ran to help a bobby who was struggling with a stretcher and found it to be

PS Turner (late of Cl Division and newly promoted).                   I helped him to take another

body to the gym where we laid him out before running and back to the LLT.

It seemed that by now more dead than alive were being carried to the gym from the

LLT.       Every time I went there someone wanted a hand with a stretcher or board             to

carry,      in the main, a mate to the first aid room, and I took             another 3 bodies

into the gym in a short space of time.            The gym was to put it bluntly awful and

I'll never forget       the sight of the bodies           dumped all over.    I'm just glad      I

didn't get stuck with staying with a body in the gym that's all.

When I went back onto the pitch again I saw a man who appeared to be a doctor

going from body to body. This was on the pitch at the Kop end of the ground where

the bodies had been carried by friends etc.               I gave mouth to mouth on a man who

the doctor thought he could save but             to no avail.      He had been carrying       out

cardiac massage on the same man.         We then went to another man         and swopped roles.

Both died and were taken away by friends etc tothe gym.

By now I was feeling rough.          I'd carried dead, worked on dead and felt shocking.

I was sweating and totally shattered.           My shoulders     were burning and I felt sick.

I just felt useless to be quite honest.           I've never     worked as hard in my life and

got nothing out of it, that's what made it worse.

By now the worse was over and I went back towards                the LLT and began to console

people on the pitch who were         crying etc. One       lad just passed out in my arms      as

we   sat    talking.   He'd   lost   his mate    in the    crowd and couldn't find    him.       I

brought him round and gave him a drink and he came to and went away.

We eventually left the pitch when all the supporters had gone and were told to

sit in the stand.

            On Sa'urday              15 A p r i l      1989,       I came       on    d u t y at B a r n s l e y     Police       Station
/(> %
            at 8 . 0 0     a.m.       and       travelled          to W e s t       Bar    Police      Station,       Sheffield,

            parading         there         at    9,00     a.m.      that       day.




           My    initial         duties          were     on S e r i a l       16 u n d e r    the     supevision          of P o l i c e

           Sergeant          S2379 S w i f t        and      we    were    deployed           at     Midland       Street       Railway

           Station         to    supervise             the a r r i v a l       of    fans     at     the    station       and    to    escort

            them     to    their        respective            buses       to    the       ground.




           These      duties          we    carried          out    u n t il    about       S . 30    p.m.    Most    supporters            we

           dealt      w i t h at       the       station were             good       humoured        and     not    under       the

            influence           of    drink.           The    only     trouble            I encountered            were    supporters

           not      wearing          team       colours,          trying       to    get    into      the    City Centre.




           Carrying         out       this       duty     I was      paired         with      Police        Constable       3198 Akred

           and      I was       issued          with a Police             radio.
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               R96



At     £.30     p.m.       our    serial          and    others        were       transported             to   the      ground        on

a Yorkshire            Traction             bus.        On    route        to    the    ground        from about            one      mile   |

away      there       was    a    lot       of a c t i v i t y       with       numerous       fans      heading         towards

the     ground who           were       boisterous,              but       generally          good      humoured.




The     closer        we    got    to       the L e p p i n g s       Lane       end    of   the      ground,         the    denser

the     amount        of    supporters             became        and       the    more       boisterous          they       became.

On     turning        right       to    go     past      the L e p p i ngs L a n e           entrance          to     the    ground,

I could         see    thousands             of    supporters,              most       of w h i c h w e r e      i n the       area

between         A and       C and       onto       the       road.         These       supporters          were       chanting,

jumping         up a n d     down and             being       generally           rowdy.          The     time      would       be

about      S . 30     p.m.        1 could          hardly        see       any    Police      Officers           around        the

area      of    the    entrance             probably          due     to    the    numbers         of     fans      outside          the

ground.          I remember             Police          Constable           13 68 M a c k e n z i e      saying         to me,

" T h e y *11    not       get    t h at     lot     in t h e r e " .




We     then went           round       to      the      ground        a n d into the         gymnasium         to       await

further         instructions.Almost                      immediately                we     were       deployed          onto    the

track      in    front       of    the W e s t          Stand.
                                                                                                                                            f
                                                                                                                                            }
                                                                                                                                            f
                                                                                                                                            I
We     went     onto       the    track        and      walked       up     in f r o n t     of    the     North        West      area      i
                                                                                                                                            I
                                                                                                                                            I
of     the W e s t     Stand.           Police          Sergeant          Swift        deployed         us a l o n g     the      front     I

of     the W e s t     Stand.           The       time       would     be       eKactly 3.0Q            p.m.     as     I remember

t he    g am e k i c k i n g o f f .




1 walked        along        the       front       of    the     stand,          I could      see       the    central

s e c t i o n was      f u ll,     but       I could          se e   that        there     was    a     lot    of     room     :i.n the     i

North Section               and    the S o u t h S e c t i o n ,            especially            towards        th e    front.
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R96

As    I walked          pa st      the       Central          North       Section           and Central            South Sections

I could       see       a great          swell          of    p eo p l e ,     many       at    the    front       were        screaming

out    about       being        squashed,               but     1 initially               put     this      down       to    the    fans

behind       them       surging          forward             and      chanting        as       the    game       had    just

started.           As    I reached                the    end       of    the C e n t r a l        South Section,                  I turned

to    face    the       crowd        and          stopped-              It w a s     then       1 could          see    many

children and             females             being       crushed          against           the      wall    and       crash

barrierrs.              At    the     front         end a          number       of    people          were       screaming          and

shouting          for    us     to    ge t        them       out.        One    man       shouted          from about             the

middle       that       there        was      a m a n at           his    feet       who       was    dead.




At    this    p o i nt       I realised             that        this      was       not     just      the    normal          sort       of

crowd       surge       and     that         nobody          could move             in t h i s       section       of       the    crowd.




I shouted          over       to     the      officer           at G a t e      3    to     open      the    gates          in o r d e r

to    get    at    l east       some         of    the       fa n s     out    and     to      esc:ort      them       back       into       the

area    at    gates          1 and       S    in the S o u t h e r n            Section.              At    this       time       the

seriousness             of    the     situation               w as      not    clear.




On    the    gates       opening             it w a s        a mad       dash       and a number             fell       forward          and

were    having          to    be     pulled         out       by o f f i c e r s .




Initially          1 was        escorting               fans       who    could       walk        away      from       the    gate       and

sitting       fans       down against                   the     crash         barrier          who    were       obviously-

injured.          A     number        of      the       fans       who    were       coming          out    who    weren't          badly

injured       were       almost          hysterical                and were          being        abusive         towards          myself

and    other       officers.



At    this    point          I could          see       that       the    incident             was    far m o r e       serious          than

I first       thought           and with            an       Inspector          I went          onto       the    pitch       in o r d e r

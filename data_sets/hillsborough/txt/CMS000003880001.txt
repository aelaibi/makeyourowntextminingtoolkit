The  following  conclusions were drawn upon statistical    data   on
disturbances   occurred  in  sporting  events   compiled   by    the
Direc?ao—Geral  dos Desportos   (Under-Secretary   of  State)    and
supplied  by by the G.N.R. (Guarda Nacional   Republicana)    police
forces:




1.    In  terms of sport events in     which   disturbances   occurred,
sport   violence     can be graphically represented by   a /descendant
curve   between     1978 and 1979 (-4.9 %).   Between 1979   and  1982,
however,   w e fffound out that a remarkable rise took   place.    From
1982   up to 1987 (year of the last available data) the number        of
matches with disturbances      has decreased.   In what concerns   this
decrease   it is worth of emphasis the reduction that       took  filace
between 1982 and 1983 (-8.3 %), as. well as betweeen 1986 and 1987
(-4.2 %)   -see          X - Table 0 and Diagrams 0.1 and 0.2 .



2.    The modality with the greater contribution of         disturbances
in the last 10 years was Football. This fact can be visualized in
Diagram   0.2 . In fact, Football contributed with 99.04 % of          the
total   number of sport events in which disturbances         took   place;
Soccer   contributed  with 0.03 % , Hockey with 0.07          %   , Skate
Hockey   with  0.46 % . H a n d b a l l with 0.24 % and Basketball    with
0,16 % .




3.    In   what   concerns Football,   the season   with  the   highest
number    of   disturbances was 1981-1932.   In Table I we     can   see
that,    until 'then, a steady and continuous     growth  took   place,
which    decreased during the 1982-1983 season, and suddenly       rised
in  the 1983-1984.      As from then the number of sport events     with
disturbances     actually   decreased  until  the   1985-1986   season.
Between    the   former   and  the 1986-1987  season   a slight     rise
occurred.




4.    If‘ we  compare  the data available  for   matches  in    which
disturbances took place, according to seasons, with the aggregate
number   of football matches for the same period, we come    to   the
Conclusion that, in average, for these 9 seasons in question      the
disturbances   in  football  matches represented 20.58   % of the
total.

In Diagram 1 we can establish that the disturbances reached their
lowest number (13.88 % )in the 1978-1979 season, and also that in
the  seasons of 1981-1982 and 1933-1984 the number  od  incidents
were considerably high in football matches, respectively 30.16  %
and 26.97 % .




5.     It is established that, during the 10 years of our  analysis,
an     average of 2.02 disturbances for each sport event took  place
and      was therefore  accounted in the  "matches  with  incidents"
n urnb e r .

From  Tabl’e and Diagram 2, we can establish that the average  of
incidents per match rises from 1978 until 1983, when we find  the
highest average (2.52 % ).

From  1983 until 1986 the average number of incidents  per     match
has been decreasing reaching its lowest value precisely in     1986.
Between 1986 and 1987 a slight rise took place.




6.  According to the type of incidents, we come to the conclusion
that,  up to 1979, the main leit-motiv is related with  referees,
more concretely in their agression.




In second place comes agressions consisting in missile throwings
and in third spectator's actions such as field invasions.

From  1980   on   this order reversed,  being   the  incidents  with
spectators   more   frequent.   Among these   -disorders  and  field
invasions,   the main problem was violence and rioting, whereas    a
decrease   in the later with a consequent rise in the former    took
place, as it can be seen in Table 3.

Despite  the  incidents  related with referees  being   ranked  in
second  place as the causers of conflits, agressions to   referees
remain  as the more important incident up to 1981.  From then   on
-with the exception of 1984, they became second immediately after
disorders and rioting among spectators.

  7.   We can positively establish that, as from 1980, violence    in
  sports consists essentially in incidents originated by    disorders
  and  rioting  among spectators, agressions to   referees,   missile
  throwing and field invasions   (see Diagram 3).

  It should also be pointed out the rise occurred between 1984   and
  1986,   in the incidents caused by the players, which reached  its
  maximum   in 1986, in proportion to the other incidents that  took
  place in the same period (15.93 % ).




  8.  The above referred data may lead to distorted conclusions               if
  not  framed    within    its causalities.     Although     a sociological
  explanation    of    the facts under analysis is not the aim         of    the
  present   study    we   think,    however, that   when    it   comes    to   a
  statistic   analysis     of   the referred data     there    are   two   main
  questions   to    be   taken in to account:     the   first    one   at    the
  observation    level    and   the   second  one   the   accuracy     of    the
  gathering of the data.

  In  this  perspective we have analysed the  evolution  that   took
  place  within  the  areas under the  supervision  of  the   G.N.R.
  police forces throughout the years under scope.

  Therefore,  as it can be seen in Diagram and Table IV, it can                be
  positively  established  a steady global rise of   the number                of
  matches under police supervision in 1980 and 1981.

  This  fact did not take place only in the South Region (1),  more
  precisely in the Beja District, where we found a decrease in  the
  number of sport premises under G.N.R. supervision  -72 in 1978/79
  and 36 in 1981/87.




Note:    (1) The regions correspond to the G.N.R.          Batallion    with
             intervention in the said districts.

It is evident that to a widening of the observation field it will
certainly   correspond  a growth of the facts   recorded.         If   we
take   in to consideration the pronounced growth of . the       violence
incidents   in sport events  between 1980 and  1 9 8 1 , it   seems    to
exist   a cause-effect relationship about this fact.      That    is   to
say, if there are more premises under police supervision, and          if
in the majority of these matches were already taking place with a
given   regularity of disturbances, it is normal that       the   G.N.R.
police   supervision will record more disturbances which, in         some
way   may justify the steady growth observed throughout all        these
years.                                                    >




9.   In what concerns the decrease of violence as from 1982, other
feasible explanations may be presented however, the fact that   it
exists a better and tougher police supervision in sport premises,
may be an inhibitor for the happening of disturbances..

We  think   that though this assumption risks to be  a simplicist
explanation    of  reality  it  is  also  one  of   the  possible
justifications for the interpretation of the data available.



10. We would like to emphasize four situations that came put          of
an analysis of the G.N.R. police force's reports.

The first one is related with the occurrence of violence     outside
sport   premises (1). The second one  is the information that     the
arbitration   committees are, several times, not official   (2).    A
third   question is the fact that G.N.R. police    forces     do not
supervise certain matches given their too high risk (3); in      this
case' they urge the clubs to guarantee public    order  themselves.
The fourth situation is related with the lack of security of      the
sport premises themselves.

These   reports give the number of   premises  with  and without
security however, the sample under analysis remain confined to    a
mere  40 % of     the  total  number  of  premises  under    actual
supervision.    This fact has as consequence that, in the   reports
coming from the relevant batallions, this information is    several
times ommitted.

With   the data available, therefore not very accurate    we  should
say,   the premises with adequate security and   safety   conditions
represent   less  than  10 % in the   last  year   under   analysis.
An   overall rise has been observed in the last years    however  it
never outstripped 5 % of the total.

^ 11.  The four situations referred in the previous paragraph     must
  be  regarded   as  possible explanations of   the   complex  process
  originating   violence,  very  oftenly  not   being   taken  in   to
  consideration   in  the  search of a more   thorough   and  complete
  understanding of this serious sporting problem.


 12.    We have been analysing the available statistical data in   a
 national   perspective.   We  must  now  establish  a territorial
 analysis   of the facts and, therefore, we analysed  the  sporting
 seasons   as  for the type of disturbances and  according  to   the
 regiojis in which they took place.

 Throughout the nine seasons in analysis, the North Region is    the
 one   that   shows   the  greatest  number   of matches  in   which
 disturbances    took   place,  following   the  Centre/North,   and
 Centre/South   and South regions.

 In  all these regions the number of disturbances rose up        to   the
 season   of 1981/1982.   Between this and the 1982/1983 season       the
 number   of   incidents decreased with the exception of     the    South
 Region,   which rose from 78 to 83 occurrences.     In the   following
 season (1983/1984) another increase took place in all regions and
 in 1984/1985 a large decrease occured again.      Between this season
 and that of 1986/1987,' a growth took place in the Itforth and South
 Regions,    a  rise   in the Centre/North Region in   the  1985/1986
 season   followed by a decrease, and a stabilized decrease in        the
 Centre/South Region.

 The correct analysis of this data can be made only if we   compare
 it with the number of matches that took place in each region, and
 we do not have this piece of information in such a short   notice.
 Nevertheless  we   can asseverate that in the last   season under
 study (1986/1987), the North Region contributed with almost   half
 of the incidents recorded throughout the country (46.7 % ).     The
 Centre/North  Region with 28.5 % , the Centre/South with   18.5   %
 and the Southern Region with 6.4 %  (see Table and Diagram V).

 If  we consider the number of sport premises under G.N.R.     police
 force's supervision, the difference is not so important with     the
 only exception of    theSouthern Region, where the number of   sport
 grounds  is quite less than in other regions.      Therefore,   from
 the  1,118  sport premises under police supervision, 29.2     % are
 located  in   the  Northern Region, 29.0 % in     the   North/Centre
 Region,  28.2   % in the cen£re/South and 13.4 % in    the  Southern
 Region.


 13.    In face of the data referred here we must agree  that  the
 frequence of the violent incidents in sport has its highest value
 in the Northern Region (1).

 The   types   of  incidents   occurred  are  of   different    natures.
 Agression    and  bodily   harm to referees is,   by   far,  the   most
 frequent    incident   in all seasons.  Up to the    1979-1980   season
 field   invasions were the second type of incident and      from   this
 season    onwards    they  were  superseeded  by     disorders    among
 spectators.

It should be pointed out the considerable weight of .the incidents
incited  by  players,  for example in  the   season  1983-1984  it
reached  a peak with 11.3 % of all the incidents occurred in   the
region, together with the incidents occurred between the players.
To  be pointed out too the frequence of the incidents stirred   up
by sporting managers which, for instance in the 1981-1982 season,
were 8.2 % of all the recorded disturbances.

Concerning   the  other regions, the diversity  and   the  rel ative
weight   of each type of incidents has almost the   same  freq uence
although   at lower levels and proportionaly to its weight in    the
overall number of incidents occurred throughout the country.


14.  After this analysis of the forms of violence that took place
in sport premises, we will comment now the relationship that       has
been  established   between   the   type  of   competition  and    the
frequence of the incidents observed.
                                                              i
From  1979   until  1987    (1), it can   be   established  that,   in
average,   59.4 % of the matches in which disturbances took      place
were  regional championships.     Other matches non relevant to    any
national   championship  had   22.7 % of   the   incidents,  National
championship matches had 9.9 % and other sport modalities 8.0 % .

In Table   and  Diagram  VI we can  establish  the  evolution . of
violence  throughout  the referred years/seasons,  taking  in   to
consideration the type of competition in which the match was  fit
in.

The proportion assumed by matches with incidents in the   regional
championships was self— revealing. Even so, it should be .referred
the existence of a greater number of matches at this   competition
level, and that national championship matches gather a high level
of spectators which rises the probabilities for the occurrence of
disturbances.

In  despite   of   this  fact, the data  available can   be   easily
understood   if we consider, on one side, the importance of     local
rivalries in regional competitions where sport presents itself as
a  institutional factor of cultural leading circles and,     on   the
other  side,   the   existence of more  inadequate sport    premises
lacking safety and security sistems.


15.  The proportion of violent incidents in district  tournaments
reached  its  peak  in  1986 with 70.2 %   .   In what   concerns
disturbances taking place in national matches, 1985 was the  year
with the greatest proportional of such incidents with 16.9 % .

It   should   be noted that 1981 and 1982 were the years   in   which
violence    reached  its  highest  levels.  However,   incidents   in
national competitions were quite few, respectively 4,3 % and      3.6
%  .    On   the other side, matches that did  not   count  for   any
championship    had their highest level of  violence,   respectively
24.3 % and 38.2 % .

If  we  associate this fact with that mentioned in   para  10 and
Annex II of the present report, in what relates the existence  of
non-official   referee committees, we may begin to understand the
pronounced   growth  of  the levels of violence  occurred  in the
season of 1981-1982.

We can therefore establish a not very steady evolution throughout
the    years under analysis, though the data concerning   the  last
year (1987) are very close to the average already  referred   for
the period covered by this analysis.

                  ?
16.   If we relate    the  type  of  competition in which     the
disturbances  were originated and the districts  that  constitute
the different regions, we come to the following conclusions!

     16.1 -       In the Northern region, the Oporto district had       the
                   highest levels     in all types of   competition   until
                   1984, with the exception of 1981, where the      highest
                   number    of   incidents  in    national   competitions
                   occurred in Viana do Castelo.      In 1984 and 1985   the
                   Braga district presents the highest values under the
                   heading    "Other matches".   In 1986-1987 Oporto    took
                   over   again the record of incidents in all types      of
                   competition already referred;

     16.2     - In the Centre/North region, the Aveiro district   had
                the  highest  values  in  all  headings,   with   the
                exception  of the districts of Viseu in   1979,  1981
                and  1983, and Coimbra in 1980, which   obtained  the
                highest results in the unknown matches, and Viseu in
                1987 (Other matches);

    16.3      -        In  the  Centre/South region,   the   data   looks   more
                      dissimilar, as follows:

                      - Lisbon had the highest values until 1982 with  the
                        exception    of   Leiria   in    1980    (National
                        championship) and, in 1981, respectively  Santarem
                        (National championship), Setubal (Unknown matches)
                        and Leiria (Others);

                  - In  1982 and 1983,  Leiria   presents  the   highest
                    values  with  the exception of Lisbon     under  the
                    heading  "Unknown  matches"   (1983)  and   Santarem
                    (National and Other matches);

                  - From   1984  until  1986,  Lisbon  takes  over  the
                    record,   with the exception of Santarem  ("Unknown
                    matches")    and   in   1985,   Leiria   ("District
                    championship matches");

                  - In 1986 Leiria presents the highest values for all
                    the headings;

                  - Lisbon  takes over the first place in  1987,  with
                    the  exception of Leiria ("District matches")  and
                    Santarem ("Unknown");
                                     24



      16.4 -    In the Southern Region,  Evora is the district  with
                the  highest values until 1981.  The exceptions  are
                Beja  in 1979 (Nationals and Unknown) and 1980,  and
                Faro (Nationals).

                In  1981,  Portalegre takes over the         top   with   the
                exception of Faro ("Unknown").

                As   from    1982,   fivora takes   the   record   with   the
                exceptions of Portalegre in 1982 ("Nationals"), Faro
                in  1983 and 1984 ("Nationals"),  Beja  ("Nationals"
                and  "Unknown" respectively), Faro in 1985 and  1986
                ("Nationals") and Beja ("Unknown"), and Faro in 1987
                ("Nationals" and "Unknown");



17.   We may therefore come to the conclusion that,   in   average,
during most of the period 1979— 1987, the Oporto district had   the
highest  number  of incidents (24.34 %), followed by   the   Aveiro
district (15.87 %) and Braga (9.76 %).

In the V i s e u , Leiria, Lisboa and Coimbra districts w e established
a participation between 5 and 7 %.       The districts with the   lower
level  of violence were 'Portalegre (0.6 %), Faro (0.95       %),  Beja
(1.14 %), Ca stel o Branco

There  are  police statistic records concerning sport  events   in
which violence occurred under the inervention area of the   P.S.P.
(Pollcia de Seguran?a Publica) police forces.  However these were
not- considered  for  they  are quite  biased  if  compared   with
previous years in which data was gathered by another police force
(G.N.R.).

If   we  put  together  the  G.N.R.  and  P.S.P.  police     forces
statistical  data, we come to the conclusion that, i n J 1987,  916
sport eventJ with incidents took place, from which it resulted an
overall number of 1632 incidents.

In Football- itself, 856 matches with    disturbances   took' place
(93.5   %),  in Soccer only 3 (0.3 %), in Hockey, 4   (0.4  %),  in
Skating   Hockey,  17  (1.9 %), in Handball, 23  (2.5   %)  and  in
Basketball, 13 (1.4 %).

(1)   1981 Report:    (quoting)         " (...) When the public feel    they
                      are     under pressure inside sport      fields    and
                      premises         (and in the presence of the   police
                      forces) and restrained from expressing          their
                      "disapproval''         towards    the  players,     or
                      r e f er e e s ,they tend to react outside the sport
                      precincts, preparing ambushes to the          referee
                      committees         and opponent players in   view   of
                      physical agressions towards them.           Sometimes
                      stockades          are  built  up   in  the    roads,
                      preventing         circulation, other times   causing
                      damages to vehicles or even missile throwings
                      and stonings, etc.



(2)         1981  and 1982 Report:   (quoting)   " (...) the   number  of
matches        umpiraged    by  non-official   referee   committees    is
increasing       larger.   These committees are normally choosen    among
the      Assistants or among the players of the teams taking part      in
the      competition.    This fact leads, obviously, to a    considerable
rise in the number of incidents given that the referee          committee
in     question is, in most of the cases, biased towards one of       the
Te a m s ” .



(3)     1979 Report:    (quoting) " (...) The G.N.R.'s  decision     to
withdraw    its  forces   does not constitute a punishment     to   the
Clubs,   but acts as a need to protect the said police forces.       In
terms    of   sport  discipline,   police' supervision    would     not
considerably    change or prevent violence at all. In order     to   do
this   effectively,   a so huge number of police   forces   wo.uld • be
necessary that it would become inadequate to implement any police
action.

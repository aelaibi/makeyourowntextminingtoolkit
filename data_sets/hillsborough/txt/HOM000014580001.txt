       TTTT.T.SROPOUGH:   COSTS OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

       Sir Clive Whitmore kindly asked if I was content with Mr Nagler's
       paper of 8th June.
       While I have no comment on the submission I do not believe that
       paragraph 8 of the draft letter to the Treasury accurately
       reflects the position. Mr Dear's recollection or understanding
       is at fault and there was no confusion at least on my part. The
       discussions I had about the enquiry with Mr Dear and Mr Wright
       are recorded in a paper (attached) which I wrote in response to a
       note from Mr Addison.

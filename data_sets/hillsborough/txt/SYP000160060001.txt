V     -                (

How are you!

I have recently had a request from                                 in Central Casework at York relating to the
Hillsborough Inquiry.

The enquiry centres on letters received from representatives of bereaved families in Merseyside,
addressed to the Director in London, asking her to re-open the inquests in this case.

The trigger for the letters was evidently Granada's recent drama documentary "Hillsborough" Mid
the Director has, for some reason, forwarded the letters to your Region.

Your Central Casework Unit has written to our Constable Ken Greenway asking him to forward a
video tape of the programme and then for us to give a briefing to your office about what, if anything,
the programme might have added in the way of material facts not placed before the courts
previously. I am unsure about the locus of your office in this matter but want to be as helpful as I
possibly can. As a token of this approach, we have already sent a copy of the videoed drama
documentary so that your Central Casework Unit can review it.

However, before taking the matter any further with your staff, I would like to up-date you on the
fact that we have done a very comprehensive briefing for the Home Office on exactly the same
subject. We have invested a tremendous amount of time and effort in answering 10 questions
forwarded through Labour MPs in Merseyside and Sheffield by the Home Office to us, designed to
flush-out the precise point of whether or not there is any new material.

I am loath to repeat the exercise for your office when the logical link would be between the
Director's Office and the Home Office, centrally.

The current state of affairs is that we have reviewed the broadcast with a fine tooth comb and have
answered each of the 10 questions in the fullest way possible, rather than taking a minimalist
approach of simply referring the enquirers to lines and paragraphs in, for example, the Taylor Inquiry
transcript, or that of the Coroner's Inquest, or the Judicial Review upon it. It is our firm view that
there is absolutely no material new in the broadcast which has not been placed before the Taylor
Inquiry, the Inquest, or the Judicial Review, and that will be my advice to the Home Secretary.

What I now propose to do is to conclude our preparation of the response to the 10 questions by the
end of next week (31 January) and send them to the Home Office. I propose also to include in that
bundle a copy of your letter and this reply, so that the Home Office may make contact with the
Director and seek her views on the best way forward.

I am also copying this letter to Donald Adams, our Chief Crown Prosecutor, for his interest.

     illsborouah Enquiry

  I refer to our recent telephone conversation.

  As a result of the recent drama/documentary on this unfortunate
  incident, this office has received four separate letters from
  families that were addressed to the Director, asking her to re­
  open the inquests in this case in the light of the "new evidence"
  uncovered by the programme.

 For the time being simple acknowledgement letters, with the
 promise of a more substantive reply to follow have been sent to
 the families concerned.

 For your information letters were received from

                   M r & Mrs Joynes
                   The Roberts family
                   J.W.Saunders
                   M r .G .w .Wright

 In our view the w a y forward is for this office to view the
 programme shown and then to receive a briefing from your office
 as to what, if anything, the programme has added in the w ay of
 material facts that might not have been placed before the Courts
 previously.

 To this end I would be grateful if you could arrange for a copy
 of the programme to be forwarded to this office, this will be
 studied and then arrangements made for yourself and Chief
 Superintendent Lowe to either attend this   office, or we travel
 to you in order that this aspect can be put in its proper
 context.                                                  r  r

 In order to avoid prolonging uncertainty    in the min d of the
 families I would suggest that the meeting take place within the
 next two to three w e e k s .

 I look forward to hearing from you.

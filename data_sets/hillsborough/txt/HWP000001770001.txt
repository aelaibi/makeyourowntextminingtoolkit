Dear Mr. Bounds,

Hillsborough Inquiry

On 19th February 1998, the Council debated the Hillsborough issue and came unanimously to the
conclusion that the Home Secretary should be asked to reconsider his decision not to hold a
further Inquiry.

They asked that I should write to the Home Secretary, conveying this view (copy letter enclosed),
and that an approach should be made to the other Merseyside Local Authorities, asking them to
support this view.

I should be grateful if you would let me know in due course whether your Authority agrees to
make similar representations.


Yours sincerely,




Director of Legal and Administrative Services

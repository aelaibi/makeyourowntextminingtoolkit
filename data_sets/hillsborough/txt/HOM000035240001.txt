Dear Ms Flashner

Further to my telephone conversation this afternoon with your colleague, Nick
Sanderson, I enclose material which might inform the Minister's response to
Sir Malcolm Thornton's adjournment debate on Wednesday.

The material comprises a copy of 'The Cook Report" from 2 June 1994, on
which Sir Malcolm appeared, and copies of key correspondence from our
subsequent complaint against the programme to the ITC. I would be grateful
if you could return the videotape in due course as it is my only record of the
programme and the urgency of your request did not permit me to make a
copy.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Yours sincerely

COMPLAINT AGAINST "THE COOK REPORT" (CENTRAL TV)                            ^

On behalf of South Yorkshire Police, I wish to make a formal complaint against "The
Cook Report" (Central TV), in respect of the programme entitled "Kevin's Mum"
broadcast on 2 June 1994.

We feel'that the programme was incorrect in material details and, consequently,
was neither fair nor impartial. The South Yorkshire Police discovered by chance
that the programme was being made. The West Midlands Police enquiry into the
action taken at the Hillsborough Disaster was conducted at our request, their
investigators acting as my agents - hence my interest and concern. When we
asked, having discovered that work was taking place on the broadcast, for the
programme-makers to accept our help, the offer was refused.      South Yorkshire
 Police was misrepresented by not being allowed to take part.

 There is much evidence in our possession which could have been included in the
 programme for balance (its consideration might even have prompted a rethink on
 the validity of the project) and which clearly disproves several key claims of the
 programme.

 A summary of our key points, which should explain our complaint in greater detail, is
 attached.
We are very disappointed to have to take the unprecedented step of using this
formal complaints procedure. We have resorted to it only after two long and
detailed meetings with representatives of the programme which, in spite of some
private admissions on their part of weaknesses in the programme, did not result in
any public apology for, or retraction of any aspect of it.

As an active supporter of openness and co-operation with the media. I have_never
disputed journalists' right to examine and question the terrible aftermath of the
Hillsborough Disaster. Many have done so and we have often co-operated. This
can surely only serve the public interest if the report concerned is researched and
presented fairly, accurately and without bias. Sadly, "The Cook Report" has fallen
short of that standard on this occasion and. because of the programme's sound
track record and popularity, we felt it was important to challenge their behaviour
and judgement.

We would welcome the Commission's scrutiny of this matter and I am happy to
participate, and for relevant police staff to participate, in any enquiry you might wish
to conduct.

If you need to clarify anything at this stage, please contact, in the first instance, my
Head of Press and Public Relations, Mrs Gillian Radcliffe, on 0742 523150.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE COMPLAINT - "THE COOK REPORT"

                    SUMMARY OF MAIN POINTS



South Yorkshire Police is, unfortunately, inextricably linked with the
Hillsborough Disaster and any programme criticising the emergency
response is bound to reflect on the actions and reputation of the force. Some
criticisms were specifically aimed at West Midlands Police, who were given
an opportunity to respond, but the general allegation of a cover-up of the
truth taints both forces as well as the Coroner's court and other parts of the
judicial system. At no time was this force offered an input to the programme.
The force press office telephoned them twice in the week before the
 broadcast, after hearing rumours that researchers had made approaches to
 some former officers involved in the disaster. Neither call received the
 courtesy of a response. Two days before the broadcast, after hearing more
 detail about the expected nature of the programme from West Midlands
 Police, the press office tried again and was eventually allowed to speak to
 researcher David Alford. He declined an offer of input to the programme,
 thereby spoiling its potential balance.

The announcer, speaking in the commercial break before the programme,
referred to Roger Cook exposing more "shady characters". Coupled with the
Radio Times entry about "The Cook Report" that week, which was in a similar
vein, this is a rather unfortunate preamble to what should have been an
unbiased examination of a terrible tragedy and serves to emphasise the
weighting of the programme to our detriment.

The programme clearly set out to "prove" that Mrs William's son was alive
beyond 3.15 pm, a claim made by one former special constable. Debra
Martin had given her account of a resuscitation attempt in her original
statement, but had changed it later when West Midlands officers explained
that her story did not fit in with the available video evidence of her actions in
the mortuary at the relevant time. The programme's determination to tell and
support only Debra's original story shows a bias, which permeated the whole
programme. Roger Cook made it clear from the beginning of the programme
that he had no doubts about the facts as he saw them: "Tonight, evidence
 previously disregarded or altered under duress and witnesses previously
 ignored demonstrate that Kevin and others could still be alive today, " he
 said.

 Such opinions reflect, in our view, predetermined attitudes on the part of the
 programme makers, rather than objective investigation of the range of issues
 involved.
4        There are a number of inaccuracies in the programme. Just one example is
         that emphasis is placed on the timing of alleged events, particularly 3.55 pm,
         the significant investigative time at which Debra Martin claims that Kevin
         Williams stirred and spoke. Times are used throughout the Report to
         underpin its claims on 'new evidence' sufficient to re-open inquest
         proceedings. But, we have a timed video film of the temporary mortuary
         where Debra was standing by Kevin's body, and, at 3.55 pm there is nothing
         at all to support her account of what happened. The video reading takes in
         'panned' coverage of the area in which Debra is standing between 3.50 pm
         and 4.10 pm. We would have been willing to show this to programme
         researchers had we been asked about it before the broadcast and we are
         sure this would have created serious doubt about Debra's story.

         Much was also made of the evidence of a serving Merseyside Police officer,
         PC Bruder, who was portrayed as a witness supporting the evidence that
         Kevin Williams was alive beyond 3.15 pm. PC Bruder's evidence does not, in
         fact, support this view. He tried in vain to resuscitate Kevin Williams, at first
         believing him to be still alive. Later, however, after medical training, PC
         Bruder made it clear to investigators that he no longer believed Kevin had
         been alive and that his small movements were actually just post mortem
         effects. As with many other aspects of the Report's "evidence", their version
         does not stand up to scrutiny when set against other verifiable testimony,
         whether through expert opinion or fact.

 I w o u l d now like to make the f o l l o w i n g comments.
                        *



 We h a v e al r e a d y made it clear to Mr W el ls that 'Kevin's Mum' was
 c a r e f u l l y researched,                        accurate and fair, and we st and by it. Far

         So far as the initial c o m p l a i n t                       - that we did not i n v o l v e S outh
         Y or ksh ire P o l i c e - is concerned, this is unjust ified. D e s p i t e our
         nu mer ous a t t e m p t s to explain t h e position, South Y o r k s h i r e s i m p l y
         fail   to        understand            what    the       programme          was    about.        The        central
         point of the p r o g r a m m e was not                       the immediate c a u s e of the
         disaster,          w h i c h was dealt w i t h               in depth by Lord J u s t i c e Taylor:
         this     lay       in       a    series       of    operational             mistakes        by       the      South
         Y o rkshire            force,          and     in        particular             Chief      Superintendent
         Duckenfield,                against          the    background             of     neglect         within          our
         national game.                  That is not in dispute.


         We were          con c e r n e d much more              d i r e c t l y with the w a y           in w h i c h     the
         claims of a number of the families,                                  that some of the v i c t i m s may
         have b e e n a live after the a r b i t r a r y cut-off point of 3.15 pm set
         by   the     Coroner,             had    been       investigated.               The     enquiry         into      the
         di s aster was conducted by the W est Midlands police,                                            and we w ere
         con c e r n e d w i t h their actions,                       as well       as t hose of th e            Coroner.
         Eoth     the      West          Midlands      Police          and    the     Coro n e r    were        given      the
         op p o r t u n i t y to respond and d i d so. In that we r e f e r r e d at all to
         the actions,                on the day,        of t h e South Yo r k s h i r e p o l i c e w e did so
                  *
         in terms w h i c h mirrored p r e c i s e l y the findings                                of Lor d J u s t i c e
         Taylor:          and    the Commission               will       be    aware      that     Lord      Taylor        was
         highly cr itical of those actions.                              In that respect,                the pr o g r a m m e
         cannot be c onsidered to h a v e                         b e e n unfair.


         We are disappointed, to say t h e least, that Mr W e l l s s h o u l d c laim
         that     in the two private m e e t i n g s we have had w i t h t hem we have
          'admitted             to       weaknesses'         in       the     programme.           This         is    highly
          misleading. In these m e e t i n g s we have made it c l e a r tha t w e stand
          by the programre,                   and we w r o t e to Mr Wells in t hose t erms on 23
          June.       A     copy         of     that    letter           is    attached,           and     ve        ask   the
          Co mmission            to      take    note       of     the       points      mad e     therein           for   the
          purpose of this response.


          Mr Wells'          letter to the C o m m i s s i o n is also m i s l e a d i n g in tha t it
          implies,          at the very least,                   that the two m e e t i n g s with m e m b e r s

        the p u r p o s e of s e e k i n g an ap ology from us. T h a t is very far from
        being       the     case.     The       initial           correspondence                shows    that    South
        Yo r k s h i r e Police b e l i e v e d we had no new                        e v i d e n c e and w i s h e d    to
        explore         our m a t e r i a l    w ith    us.       We     did   so     at   t heir       request.       The
            second meeting wa s held on a Sunday for th e e x p r e s s p u r p o s e of
        discussing a possible                   interview with Mr Wells,                         for inclusion          in
            the   update.      In   s uch     an    interview            Mr    Wells       c ould     have     stated,
        p u b l i c l y and for the record,               his views on t h i s w hole matter.                           He
        c h o s e not to d o         so,      for the wh o l l y u n s u b s t a n t i a t e d reason              that
            he clai m e d "not to trust" The Cook Report.


^           For   ycur     convenience,            we   will           deal    with        Mr    Wells'       detailed
            c o m p l a i n t s in the same numerical order.

r e q u e s t by a number of the                           families       for a fresh inquiry.


Debra       Martin,            whom       we     interv i e w e d        at     length             in     order       to
satisfy          ourselves            of       the       accuracy        of    he r       account,             gave    a
s t a t e m e n t to West M i d l a n d s po l i c e in e x a c t l y the same t erms
as    to us:         that K e v i n            was        a live w a y    beyond              3.15,       when     she
and     others          tried        to     resuscitate              him.       She           later       signed       a
s e c o n d statement to fit in w i t h the a c c o u n t urged on her by
West     Midlands.              Her        two           statements       cannot              both       be     true.
D e b r a Ma rtin insisted to us,                               over and o ver again,                     that the
f ir st statement was th e true version of events. We a c c e p t e d
t hat    for        the       f o l lowing        reasons.           That      the        first          sta t e m e n t
tallied           with        the     evidence              (referred          to        elsewhere             in the
programme) ,              and         the        se c o n d       did not;               and        we      ha d two
w i t n e s s e s to co nfirm tha t D ebra had bee n both badgered and
bullied          into changing h e r e v i d e n c e to sui t the rather m ore
c o s y po l i c e version of                    events.

C o u l d we ask the C o m m i s s i o n to consider,                                   for a moment,              the
w a y in which this par t of the co m p l a i n t is put by Mr Wells:


"Debra           Ma r t i n    had     given              her    account        of        a    resus c i t a t i o n
attempt           in     her     original                statement,           but       ch anged          it    later
when     W e s t Midlands                 officers              e x plained     that           her       story     did
n o t fit in with the a v a i l a b l e video e v i d e n c e of her actions
in the mor tuary at the r e l e v a n t time."


This        is     an    approach           to       evidence        which          a     court          would     not
accept            for      a     moment.                 Evidence        should           be        the        hon e s t
recollection                  of a witness,                 whether       it        'fits          in'    with     the
a c c o u n t of others or not.                           It is p r e c i s e l y this approach to
evidence            (arriving at a conclusion,                                and    t h e n manipu lating
th e facts to make them fit)                                tha t has led to a number of the

miscarriages               of     justice           we     have       seen     recently,           many        of
w h i c h h a v e resulted in the p r o s e c u t i o n of p o l i c e officers.
We    are,      frankly,           shocked           that        this       approach       seems         to    be
e n d o r s e d by a Chief C o n s t a b l e .                  A g a i n s t that background,                 it
is s i m p l y insulting to c l a i m that w e a p p r o a c h e d this matter
with       a     'predetermined                     attitude'            and        were       less       than
ob je c t i v e .    We i n v e s tigated D e b r a ' s a c c o u n t very t h o r o u g h l y
indeed,         as    well         as     taking           careful          legal     advice- on              the
d i v e r g e n c e in her st a t e m e n t s .             Her i n s i s t e n c e that the first
statement           is the truth              is c o n v i n c i n g        and is corroborated.


W e t h e r e f o r e concluded t h a t Debra M a r t i n told the truth,                                      as
she     insists           (not     just       to     us)     in her         first     statement,              and
was    bullied            into c h a n g i n g       it.     The discrepancy                  b e t w e e n her
statements             is        grap h i c         proof        of     that,        and       t here         was
corroborative                evidence          of     the       treatment           accorded        to    her.
Any    obj e c t i v e       observer          cannot           fail     to    be    struck       by     those
di s crepancies.                It is s i m p l y          not g o o d      enough       to    ignore the
f irst       account,            w hich       sh e       insi s t s      is    the       truth,        simply
b e c a u s e it does not fit.                      The    'bias'       lies in t h o s e w h o seek
to do just that,                  and n o t         in the prog ramme.                It was        fear of
p r e c i s e l y that kind of m a n i p u l a t i o n w h i c h led to the local
ambulance            service          refusing             to     allow       their        s taff        to    be
i n t e r v i e w e d by the p o l i c e at all:                      s t a t e m e n t s were taken by
t h e i r own solicitors.


In    any      event,        it     is s i m p l y        not    tru e      that     Debra's        account
was      inconsistent               with       the         video       evidence          taken       in       the
mortuary.            On     Mr    Wells'           admission           that     footage         beg i n s      at
3.50pm:         leaving           ample        tim e       for       Debra's        attempt         to    save
Kevin,         which          she       described               to     us     in     a     way      tota l l y
c o n s i s t e n t with her first s t a t e m e n t


"I remem b e r            looking d o w n at a d a r k                  eyed boy.          I th ought he
m u s t have bee n about e l e v e n or twelve, because, well ha was
 small to m y point of v i e w a n d w h a t stood out on hi m w a s the
 fac t that he'd got a n e c k l a c e w i t h a little horn on it. He


                                                -    5 -
was laid there and this police officer looked at me and he
went "Oh, he's had it".


These boys were screaming "you've got to help him,                                       you've
got to help him",           and I said "I'm trying to do the best I
can". I bent down and I felt for                       a pulse, I could hardly
feel anything in his wrist at all, so I felt at his throat.
I applied a bit more pressure,                      and I actually got a little
flutter.      He    was    still    pale,        but      you    could    see       a    slight
greyness      coming       into     him    and       he'd       got    vomit    round       his
mouth.


We managed to get him into a recovery position. This other
policeman      turned round and                said,      "come on we'll            taka him
into the gym".         I had the bottom end,                    he took the head end
of the bill board and we ran.


We went      into    the gym and          there was             just bodies         laid all
around and I think there was a doctor there. By then they'd
started cordoning the dead ones off the live ones.
  *

I'd already started mouth to mouth on the actual pitch.                                         I
started mouth to mouth a g a i n . As I say I continued CPR on
this     little boy,        I had no       idea what             his name was            and he
actually got a little bit of colour. And I don't know what
 it   was,    I     just    looked    at       him     and      I     picked    him       up.   I
 actually cradled him, and I thought "you are not going to
 die, you cannot die".


 I remember holding him and I thought "no he's only a baby,
 it   can't    be    happening".          So    I    held       him,    and    he       actually
 openad his eyes. It wasn't a definite stare at me, his eyes
 just    fluttered         and he    looked         and    he made       a noise,         and     I
 thought "I've got him,              I've actually got him alive".                          As I
 say, he made a noise and I looked again and I bent my head
 down    to him,      and his       eyes       opened       and he      looked          straight
 ahead and he went "mum", and then his eyes fluttered again,


                                      -   6 -
/
    and ha just seemed to slump back                              in my arms again.                And    I
    just, I looked at him and I thought "no, there's something
    wrong here".


    I   laid    him    flat        again    and       gave    him        heart     massage.          This
    police officer came up to me and what I didn't know was
    there was a doctor               there and he must have made a sign                                  to
    him. I remember someone patting me on my back, and he said
    "leave it love,           he's dead". I went "no,                       he can't be",              and
    I know I continued with CPR.                        I was           raally going          at     him,
    giving him mouth and a heart massage again, and then I was
    pulled back and told "he'3 dead".                             Then I heard somebody's
    voice saying "all the police officers with bodies,                                         you've
    got to stay in the gym".


    I remember standing up and I thought "I've got to get out
    of here, I really have", and then the other half of me was
    saying "be         sensible       you've got             to     stay with your             body".
    That's      what    we    were     told,          you've        got     to    stay     with        the
    bodies all the time.
    *


    So we stayed with the bodies, and by this time it was about
    tan    to   four when           I'd been         told     he     was       dead,    and    then       a
    doctor came round who had to certify proper death, and that
    was    after       four    o'clock.          I     remember           it     was    after        four
    o'clock because I looked down at my watch, because again it
    was a note that I'd got to make in my pocket book."




    The    evidence      t hat      Kevin       vas    alive        wel l       after    3.1 5 p m     was
    also    supported         by    the evidence             of    PC    Bruder,        to w h i c h     we
    refer below.


    Mr Wells makes much of the alleged 'bias' of the programme.
    This       is   quite     unfair.       We        have        looked,        objectively           and
    fairly,         at all    the     evidence.         Thi s       is     in    contrast      to      the
    police treatment of Debra Martin,                             i n c l u d i n g the ludicrous


                                            -   7 -
        assertion          that     she    wa s       not      even    at    Hi llsborough.           As      Mr
        W e l l s now acc epts that Debra was seen in the p o l i c e video,
        that     is d e m o n s t r a b l y wrong,          and we should            repeat        t h a t the
        investigating             force        involved        has    made    no     complaint.            This
        aspect       of    the    ma t t e r    does      not co ncern        South         Yorkshire         at
        all.     At the end of the day,                     what matt e r s        is that D ebra


        M a r t i n was asked to sign                   a second sta t e m e n t w h i c h "She did
        not be li ev e - and does not believe - to be the truth.                                           This
        is co mm on ground.




    4   D e b r a ' s original account made it clear that her a t t e m p t to
        s av e   Ke vin was        over        just      before       3.50pm,      and    not      3.55.     We
        made     this a b un da ntly clear                  in cur update programme.                   Those

        li t t l e   further comment              from us. Again,             Mr Wells          ignores a
        n o w cor rob or at ed s t a t e m e n t which does not suit his p u r p o s e s

Dear Ms Elliott

Complaint about 'The Cook Report", 2 June 1994

Thank you for your letter of 5 August and your subsequent assistance in enabling us
to view a copy of "The Cook Report" update programme. Please accept my apologies
for the delay in responding, but I have had to draw together views and information
from several sources in the force.

 In your letter, you asked for some background material on the scope and remit of the
 Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor and that conducted by West Midlands Police.

 I enclose copies of the four reports which summarise the necessary information and
 hope that you find them helpful.

 To answer your second question, we have no video evidence of Kevin Williams in the
 temporary mortuary between 3.38 pm and 3.50 pm. Prior to that there is brief
 footage of him being carried across the pitch with his head covered by his clothing,
 earlier resuscitation attempts having apparently failed. The programmes original
 claims were clear - that Kevin Williams had shown signs of life "at 3.55 pm . The
  precision of this and other times detailed in their assertions was crucial because the
  whole point of the programme was to challenge the times of death as determined by
  the inquest. Minutes were, therefore, of some significance.




                                                                       1 of 2
We showed "The Cook Report" the video evidence that there were no obvious
resuscitation attempts on Kevin after 3.50 pm. In the update programme, their former
core assertion that Kevin was fighting for life "at 3.55 p.m." becomes - on two
occasions "around ten to four". There is no explanation of this change and no inclusion
of any- of the rebuttal material offered by us during seven hours of discussion with the
production team in the weeks between the two programmes.

Mr Wells feels that this treatment of the information we provided to the team vindicates
his decision not to take part in a pre-recorded and edited interview for the update.

We had advanced what we believed to be convincing evidence which established a
chain of events showing that the producers' times - which they had used to persuade
viewers of meticulous investigation - were flawed. It was, in consequence, difficult to
see when, or if at all. ex-Special Constable Debbie Martin could actually have
experienced what she remembered.

This flaw was acknowledged on the team's first visit to South Yorkshire Police's
Headquarters on Monday, 20 June, by David Alford; his exact words, on being
presented with the totality of our evidence, were" I recoil". This acknowledgement was
retracted subsequently by Peter Salkeld, in David Alford's absence, on Sunday. 26
June, on the occasion of "The Cook Report" team's second visit to us.

Mr Wells had no faith, therefore, that the update programme would be any more
accurate or objective than the original programme. As mentioned earlier, he felt this
stance was vindicated on viewing the update. It was, as anticipated, simply more
selective treatment of old "facts".

 I hope this covers the questions in your letter of 5 August. We would like to raise a
 number of additional points, arising from Robert Southgate’s response to you about
 our complaint. These are covered on the attached report.

 We look forward to hearing from you in due course.

 Yours sincerely




 Gillian Radcliffe AMIPR
 Head of Press and Public Relations
Complaint by South Yorkshire Police about "The Cook Report", 2 June 1994.


FURTHER POINTS AND INFORMATION RAISED BY SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE


1.     In the update, our doubts about Debra Martin's claims were portrayed as
        accusations of lies on her part. That was unfair. That she was lying was only
        one unpalatable possibility. What seemed to us more likely, as explained by
        our officers, was that she was mistaken, either in her recollections of what
        happened and when, or in her interpretation of post mortem reactions from
        Kevin. Clearly, the other option would be that she was right and that Kevin was
        still alive in the temporary mortuary. That conflicts with not only her own
        second statement and sworn evidence, but also, despite claims in the
        programme, with evidence from a number of other witnesses and provable
        facts.

2.     Robert Southgate's letter mischievously sees something sinister (Page 4) in our
       suggestion that Debbie Martin's evidence did not "fit in" with other evidence and
       uses this to make a wholly unjustified side-swipe at our integrity. Surely, it is
     • his own team's behaviour which is being scrutinised here and not ours.
        However, we will give a response because a similar suggestion of improper
        suppression of evidence by the police was made in the original programme.
       The transcript shows the voice-over saying, "It (Debbie Martin's first statement)
        didn't fit the 3.15 cut-off point and somehow had to be changed." (The
        underlining is our emphasis.)

        Debbie's first statement was never changed. As in many, many cases of
        investigation where later facts emerge, requiring clarification, an additional
        statement was taken and both were made available to the Coroner. The
        content is different in each statement and is there to be compared and
        contrasted in the judicial process. We had shown the producers that West
        Midlands Police officers, at the time of their investigating the disaster, had
        access to our video material which cast doubt on Debbie's first statement.
        They were duty-bound to challenge her first account.

3.     The update included "The Cook Report" team's second interview with Debbie
        Martin and the interviewer puts to her, quite properly, our perception that she
        was traumatised at the time. Her reply is contradictory. She says first: "I was
        absolutely ... ju s t.... gob-smacked. I had never had this happen to be before.
        ... a little boy died in my (arms) ..."

         but then:

         "How can they say I didn’t know what I was doing? It's absolute rubbish."



                                                                              1 of 2
       In short, she seems to agree and then disagree with the assertion that she was
       traumatised. Why was this not pursued by the interviewer? If it was pursued,
       why not broadcast? Perhaps the programme makers were unable to accept that
       there might be another explanation.

4.    The programme's "missing ambulance," which they claimed to have traced, was
       never missing. It appeared briefly on the video shown at the inquest, although
      the programme said that, "strangely", it did not. The crew were, in fact, traced
       and interviewed so the Report's claims are, again, misleading.

5.     We still do not accept the team's claim that the programme did not need input
       from South Yorkshire Police. Whatever their intentions, there can be little doubt
       that the programme would be closely associated with this force in the minds of
       many viewers. Roger Cook's doorstepping of retired Chief Supt David
       Duckenfield inevitably contributed to that. As custodians of all the files of
       evidence and information on the various enquiries and investigations which
       followed the disaster, we were ideally placed to discuss their claims and
       conclusions and. where possible, to suggest alternative points of view or
        highlight conflicting evidence. We would have been satisfied had there been
        a clear balance of information and views in the programme. If they had talked
     - to us before the first programme - our constant position - they would not have
        dug themselves the hole in which they now find themselves sitting. Their
        difficulty is that they have excited hope and expectation in Kevin's mother and
        cannot, understandably, be seen to retreat.

       lA ^ l J

I have now completed consideration of yotxz complaint of 4 July
about an edition of The coo* Report: Xevia's Xum, shown on ITT
on 2 June this year.       I am grateful for the assistance
Mrs Radcliffa gave ay staff in providing additional information
which helped us understand the complex background to the
Hillsborough disaster and subsequent events. The necessity to
go back both to your office and to Central has lengthened the
process of investigation and I am sorry therefore not to have
been able to reply to you sooner*
As you Know, it is the ITC's responsibility to ensure that the
requirements of the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the TTC's Programme
Code are complied with in respect of programme standards. These
requirements include due impartiality on controversial matters,
fairness, accuracy, taste, decency and so on.     Accordingly, we
have looked carefully at the original programme, the relevant
section of the update programme, and, as X have said, sought
additional information from your office and from Central.
I now turn to the detail of the complaint in the order in which
you summarise it in your letter of 4 July.

l.   south Yorkshire Police vere not invited to participate in
     the programme, and this was unfair and misleading*
Central Television say that it was unnecessary to invite the
South Yorkshire Police to take part because the subject of the
programme was not the actions of South Yorkshire officers at
Hillsborough. Rather it was claims from victims' families that
the 3.15 pm cut-off point set by the Coroner failed to take into
account the possibility that some victims might have been
rescuable beyond that point, and that these families believed
they were owed an investigation into events after that time.

                     Telephone 071 255 3000 Fax 0~1 306 7800
It was in the ITC's viev legitimate for The Cook Report to
investigate these claims, and to consider information that might
indicate that the investigation by the West Midlands Police was
flawed in some respects. The programme did refer to the actions
of South Yorkshire Police at the scene but this was justified in
my view by the need to describe the wider context for the
specific questions posed about the appropriateness of th* 3.15 pa
cut-off point* The references to the South Yorkshire police..wart
not central to the main theme of the programme - which considered
the case for a further enquiry - and you do not dispute their
accuracy.     Zn our viev Central's attempted interview with
Mr Duckenfield added nothing to viewers' understanding of the
issues raised in the programme. It was irrelevant to the main
subject.
It was always open to Central Television to involve the South
Yorkshire Police in their preparations for the programme and to
have sought a recorded interview, but it was not in our view
necessary for them to have done so in order to comply with the
requirements for fairness and due impartiality.  We do not find
that such an omission demonstrated bias or misled viewers.

2»   On-air presentation   and   billings were   derogatory aai
     inappropriate*
The presentation announcement which immediately preceded the
programme in the Yorkshire Television area according to YTY's
records was: "Now, The Cook Report." The Radio Times billing for
that week does describe Cook as "that scourge of the crooked and
corrupt".    This is a generic billing used when details of
individual editions are not available at the time Radio Times
goes to press. Viewers are sufficiently familiar with the series
to know that the programmes include a diverse range of
investigations in which criminal activity is not always the
subject matter.

3,   The programme sought to prove a pre-deterained outcome oa
     limited evidence and therefore demonstrated bias.
The available evidence indicates that a number of witnesses
(including the two temporary stretcher-bearers and PC Bruder)
believed Kevin Williams to be alive and recoverable for some time
after 3.15 pm. The original programme gave considerable emphasis
to the belief that Kevin was still alive at 3.55 pm, based on his
mother's statement. In the event this was unsubstantiated, but
there does seem to us sufficient other evidence to support claims
that he might have been alive for some time beyond the 3.15 pa
cut-off point.    The victims' families obviously feel that the
Coroner's decision denied them an opportunity to know more about
what happened and it was not inappropriate to air these views and
beliefs in the programme.    We noted that Sir Malcolm Thornton,
Mrs. Williams' MP, supported her case.
                               -3 -




X do not agree that the programme relied only on Debra Martin's
evidence on this, though I accept that her interview did for* a
central and powerful element. Ms Martin's evidence was presented
in a straightforward way and viewers were told that it conflicted
with her second statement.
Cook's introduction is a stylistic device to summarise
programme in terms that will engage the audience; we dp net
believe this demonstrated that the programme was biased from the
out3et. Investigative programmes such as She Cook Seport do
present their conclusions in a decisive style. The question is
whether the evidence on which those conclusions are based is
sound and properly tested, and not misleadingly presented.

4.   inaccuracies
Central Television now accept that there is no substantive
evidence to suggest that Kevin Williams was still alive at
3.55 pm, as the original programme claimed.          They believe
however that the programme did offer convincing evidence that
Kevin was alive well after 3.15 pm. Nevertheless, the three
separate references to Kevin being alive at 3.55 pa in the
original programme were incorrect and inconsistent even with
Debra Martin's account, not included in the programme, which said
"... and by this time it was about ten to four when I'd been told
he was dead..."     This was clearly an error, but the difference
of fivfe minutes did not undermine the material put forward in the
programme about the 3.15 pm cut-off point. The update programme
did carry the corrected information.
We believe, on the available information, that it was likely that
witnesses, including Debra Martin and PC Bruder, genuinely
believed Kevin to be alive and recoverable at the time they first
had contact with him after 3.15 pm. What cannot be established
at this stage is whether the 'signs of life' they thought they
detected were post-mortem effects, or whether - though alive -
Kevin's injuries were already so severs that recovery was very
unlikaly.   Thera seems a sufficient margin of doubt to justify
the programme exploring the families' claims that the matter was
not properly investigated.

5*   Turther Points and Information
Gillian Radcliffe's letter of 8 September makes further points
which we have examined. We have looked at the update programme
again in the light of your view that it was unfair and inaccurate
to portray your doubts about Debra Martin's account as
accusations of lies. That is not however what the programme
said. The commentary said: n... South Yorkshire Police... have
said... that Debra... isn't a credible witness”. Cook then asks
Debra Martin: "... the police are now sayingyour first statement
can't be believed. Do you still stand by it?
Although this provides no detailed background to the doubts about
the evidence, it does we believe accurately summarise your view.
The piece also later includes the suggestion that she nay have
been too traumatised to have an accurate recollection of events.
On the question of the 'missing' ambulance, it appears froa the
inquest transcript that the police evidence identified only two
ambulances: one at 3.15 pm and another at 3*20 pm*         As the
Coroner confirmed in his interview in the programme, -neither
fitted with PC Brudar's firm recollection of the passing of aa
ambulance at 3.37 pm. Yet the time-coded video extract shown in
the programme clearly identifies the ambulance on the pitch at
3.37 pm. If this film was shown at the inquest the question
arises as to why it was not recorded in the transcript and why
the Coroner found such difficulty in reconciling PC Bruder's
evidence with the available video pictures. Perhaps the brief
appearance you mention was indeed that of the same ambulance, but
at 3.20 pa not 3.37 pm. You also say the craw vers traced and
interviewed. The programme did not claim that they had never
been intarviawad, though we understand they were interviewed, not
by West Midlands Police but by solicitors on behalf of the
ambulance service, and that the general statements taken were not
produced as evidence at Kevin Williams' inquest. We therefore
believe that the programme was not materially misleading on
either point.
I conclude that, on the substantive points of your complaint,
there were no breaches of the statutory and regulatory
requirements for due impartiality and fairness in this programme*
The inaccurate references to Kevin Williams' condition at
3,55 pm, subsequently corrected in the update programme, and the
irrelevant attempt to interview Mr Duckenfield lessened its
authority but in other respects I judge this to have been a
legitimate investigation into a matter of public interest.
I am copying this     letter to Robert    Southgate   at Central
Television.

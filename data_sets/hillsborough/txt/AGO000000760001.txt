        HILLSBOROUGH

        Since we spoke this morning, I have received the attached note from Paul Pugh
        covering the first draft of an oral statement which the Home Secretary would
        wish to make. It is clear that nothing will happen next week but possibly the
        week after.

        My first impression is that the draft statement is close to the mark but
        paragraphs 17 to the end will need some revision to make it clear that, so far
        as the Attorney General and the DPP are concerned, the purpose of the
        exercise will not be to review decisions already taken but to ascertain whether
        there is any further evidence which has not already been considered by the
        appropriate decision-maker.

        I would welcome a word. I would hope that we can agree a joint
        response/commentary on the draft speech.

Here is a first draft of an oral statement for you to work on. On present plans I would
like to get a draft to the Home secretary for next weekend. I am out of the office
Monday - Wednesday, but Peter Edmundson should be able to field any comments
in my absence.

 rORAFT:             13 JUNE 1997



 DRAFT ORAL STATEMENT FOR THE HOME SECRETARY



 With permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the
 Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


 2.         It is now more than eight years since the disaster on 15 April 1989. But no
 one who saw the news reports on that dreadful Saturday will have forgotten those
 terrible events. For those who lost loved members of their family, the memories are
 even more painful. We all felt then that we must do all in our power to prevent
 anything like the events of that appalling day happening again.


 3.         A Public Inquiry by Lord Taylor was immediately established. The terms of
 reference of the Inquiry were not only to enquire into the events but to make
 recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events. The Inquiry took
 oral evidence from over 170 witnesses at public hearings during May and June 1989
 and considered many hours of video evidence from different sources. In his interim
 report in August 1989 he found that there were a number of causes for the disaster.
 He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278
 he made clear that:


             “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control”


 4.         Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report in January
 1990 made a further 76 recommendations. The developments which have taken
 place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
 have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
 been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
 reaching and soundly based conclusions.

  5.        The deaths which occurred on 15 April 1989 were the subject of inquests
  conducted by the Coroner of the western district of South Yorkshire.


  6.        An inquest is a fact-finding inquiry to establish answers to four important
  questions. They are:


             The identity of the deceased


             The place of death


             The time and the date of death and


             How the deceased came by his or her death


  7.        The Coroner’s rules require proceedings and evidence to be directed solely at
  finding answers to those questions.


  8.        The jury examining the evidence found that the cause of death for those who
  died at Hillsborough was accidental death.


  9.        There was a further investigation conducted by the West Midlands Police,
  supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
  grounds for criminal proceedings. That investigation also considered whether any
  police officer should be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


  10.       That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
  scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
  Inquiry.        After that investigation the evidence was sent to the Director of Public
  Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
  proceedings. The Police Complaints Authority decided that the senior officers in
  charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for neglect of duties.         In the


  BoppuMiouUIra fte\pp0232p4.doc
13 JUN '97 13:16 HOME OFFICE -F8- 071 273 4284                                       P. 4/4




  event, Chief Superintendent Duckenfteld retired due to ill health in advance of a
  ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. The Police Complaints Authority later decided that
  disciplinary proceedings against Mr Duckenfield’s deputy should be withdrawn
  because the retirement of Mr Duckenfield meant that what, in effect, was a joint
  allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the more
  senior officer.


  11.          It is well known that some of the families of those who died were unhappy
  with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial review of the coroner's
  proceedings. During the judicial review proceedings the conduct of the inquest was
  subjected to close and detailed examination.           The court ruled that none of the
  matters raised in the judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in
  the verdict of the inquest.


  12.         The events surrounding the disaster have therefore been subject to
  exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.           But concerns have
  remained about whether the full facts have yet emerged. I have met relatives of the
  Hillsborough victims. I know that they believe passionately that there are unresolved
  issues which should be investigated further.


  13.         Representations have been made to me and my predecessor, to the Attorney
  General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.               A Granada television
  programme in December dramatised the disaster and raised a number of issues
  which, in the view of the programme makers, presented new evidence about the
  disaster.           Since that time further material has been submitted on behalf of the
  Hillsborough Family Support Group.              Those representations have related in
  particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
  death of the victims.


  14.         My department, the office of the Attorney General and the Crown Prosecution
  Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward




  i-\oppu\liouSdrafts\pp0232pd.doc
3 JUN '97 13:17 HOME OFFICE -F8- 071 273 4284                                           P .5/4




 in recent months. We have been unable to find anything which we consider would
 have materially affected the outcome of any of the investigations into the disaster.


 15.        Much of the evidence which has been put forward concerns matters which
 were fully addressed by the previous investigations. For example, the Granada
 television programme suggested that there were ten unresolved questions about the
 disaster. I am satisfied that all those ten questions were fully considered by the
 Taylor Inquiry, and in relation to eight of them specific recommendations were made.


 16.        I have not so far received any evidence which would lead me to conclude that
 a new public inquiry should be established.          Similarly, the Director of Public
 Prosecutions considers that none of the material which has been made available
 would justify fresh criminal investigations.     The Attorney General takes a similar
 view in relation to the possibility of applying to the High Court for a new inquest.


 17.       However, I want to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and
 that we do not come to a conclusion without a full and independent examination of
 the evidence.


 18.       The Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and i have
 therefore agreed that the representations which have been put forward should be
 subject to independent scrutiny. We are therefore appointing Lord Justice Stuart -
 Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, to consider all the available
 evidence and to report to us.        His terms of reference are: [to be inserted after
 agreement between Ministers.]


 19.       We have asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to examine all the written and other
 evidence which has been submitted.          He will also consider any further material
 which interested parties wish to submit. There will be an opportunity for interested
 parties to make representations to him if he considers that necessary to enable him
 to form a view. His task will be to provide advice on the basis of his independent

        consideration of the evidence.         This will not be a Public Inquiry.    However, I
        undertake to make public the advice which he gives under this terms of reference.


        20.         I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively that no
        material evidence has been overlooked in establishing the causes of the disaster.

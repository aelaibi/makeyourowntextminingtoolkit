HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY - PART II
TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY


Please find enclosed the minutes of the Working Party meeting
held at Queen Anne's Gate on Tuesday 23 January.  Together with
these, I am enclosing a copy of the draft 'Supplementary Notes'
paper which has been prepared by Professor Maunder.  Given the
tight schedule, I should be grateful if you would let me have
comments by telephone in the first instance.

I hope that, by now, each of you will have received a copy of
Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report.  However, if it has not
arrived by the end of the week, please let me know and I will
ensure that a further copy is dispatched.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                        JONATHAN SWEET
                                        Hillsborough Inquiry
           TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES
Introduction

1.   In the review of the technical aspects of safety, the
Technical Working Party considered the content and the
presentation of the Green Guide in detail.  The principal
conclusions of the review and the consequent recommendations are
contained in the Working Party Report to the Inquiry, but in view
of the amount of material gathered in the course of the work
detailed suggestions for the revision of the Green Guide are
assembled in this separate document as a contribution to any
revised edition.

2.   The Final Report refers to the relationship between the
Green Guide and the Safety Certificate and to the view that the
local authority should follow the Green Guide criteria in
assessing the mandatory requirements for a particular ground.
Variation from the figures then included in the Safety
Certificate would only be permitted by formal revision.

3.   Paragraph 3 of the Report of the Technical Working Party
already records that:

     "3.  It considers that a revised issue of the Green Guide
     should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand
     is certified by the certifying authority, and recommends
     that any departures from the guidance or Technical
     provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be
     fully defined and should be subject to approval in writing
     by the certifying authority".

4.   The Technical Working Party believes that a revised edition
of the Green Guide should incorporate these recommendations
prominently in the introduction.  A high degree of definition in
the guidance offered will be required if ambiguity is to be
avoided.

Non-technical Aspects

5.   Non-technical aspects of the Green Guide lay outside the
Technical Working Party's terms of reference, but they interact
closely with the physical characteristics of grounds.
Responsibilities for the improvement of structures and
communications at grounds, and for the conduct of inspections and
tests, including those accepted from the Technical Working
Party's Report, should be made clear in the Green Guide.
Particular attention should be drawn to the management and
training of those carrying out the work, to the monitoring of
procedures, and to the recording of results.

6.   Reference to the required degree of competence of those
responsible for carrying out the technical work should be
included in the Green Guide.  An example from the Pressure
Systems code of Practice is:
      "3.1.     The 'competent person' (whether a body or an
      individual) should have such practical and theoretical
      knowledge and actual experience of the type of system which
      is to be examined as will enable defects or weaknesses,
      which it is the purpose of the examination to discover, to
      be detected and their importance in relation to the
      integrity and safety of the system to be assessed."

A reference to "the recommending of corrective measures" might be
added to appropriate specifications.

7.   For the following notes, reference should be made to the
index of Technical Working Party's papers and to the Technical
Working Party Report.

CHAPTER 3 - GENERAL FABRIC AND STRUCTURAL MATTERS

8.   The chapter should aim to include (i ) a broad introduction
to the requirements for structures, but without numerical detail,
(ii) reference to later chapters of the Green Guide where details
are to be found, and (iii) reference to other documents such as
the SCICON report and the ISE reports.

9.   Consideration should be given to a separate chapter on
lighting, electrical supplies and computer-based equipment.

CHAPTER 4 - INSPECTIONS AND TESTS

10.  A major re-write should be undertaken along the lines of the
Technical Working Party Report paragraph 40.  If it is decided to
separate details of the structural testing of crush barriers, for
example, or the effectiveness of communication systems, from the
text of the chapter, clear references should be given.

11.  It is important to outline the purposes of inspections and
tests and it is vital to emphasise that accurate and certified
records of all such procedures must be kept.

12. A complete tabulation of the minimum requirements of
inspection and test, including frequencies, should be provided.

13.   See also Technical Working Party Recommendation 16.

CHAPTER 5 - INGRESS

14.  if separate chapters on ingress and egress are retained they
should be well co-ordinated with each other.  They should also be
well co-ordinated with the chapters on stairways and ramps and on
means of escape from fire.

15.  Prominence should be given to the importance of each ground
having a fully documented networked plan delineating all aspects
of ingress and egress not only within the ground but also at its
approaches.  For both ingress and egress, the plan should take
account of the distribution of entrances and exit routes so as to
encourage even packing and dispersed departures.
16.  The principal conclusions and recommendations on ingress are
given in paragraph 33 and Recommendation 12 of the Technical
Working Party Report.  They incorporate the proposals contained
in Mr Bush's paper of 30 October 1989.

CHAPTER 6 - EGRESS

17.  The principal conclusions are recorded in minutes 10-17 of
WP89(M)3, derived from discussion on 7 November 1989 of Mr Bush's
paper on egress.  Detailed proposals for improvements in the
arrangement and the clarity of the text are made in these
documents, including co-ordination of material with other
chapters, as also noted above.  It is recommended that particular
attention should be given to the paragraphs on funnelling and
reservoir areas, to which Recommendation 13 of the Technical
Working Party Report also refers.

CHAPTER 7 - STAIRWAYS AND RAMPS

18.  The Technical Working Party's conclusions are summarised in
paragraphs 19-27 of WP89(M)3 and in paragraphs 36-39 of the
Report.  Reference should also be made to Mr Bush's paper on
stairways and ramps circulated for discussion on 7 November 1989.

19.  Particular attention should be given to improving the
clarity of presentation in the text and to introducing more and
better illustrative diagrams.  Reference to the spacing of
handrails and their extensions at the top and bottom of stairways
should be revised (Recommendation 15 of the Technical Working
Party Report).

20.  The requirements for handrails, balustrades and barriers
serving different functions should be differentiated.  Barriers
are required at exits to/from ramps leading directly to the rear
of terraces.  More explicit guidance should be given to those
handrails or other protective structures that separate a stairway
or ramp from a hazardous drop.  Handrails should be provided to
assist the channelling of flows through wide ramps.

CHAPTER 8 - TERRACES AND VIEWING SLOPES

21.  A more positive approach should be adopted to the marking of
gangways. All gangways should be kept clear during events:
"discouragement" from standing in them is not enough (see
Professor Maunder's and Mr Stickley's notes on chapter 8).  The
front-to-back spacing of crush-barriers should be less on viewing
slopes than on terraces;  a ratio of two-thirds is recommended.

CHAPTER 9 - CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS

22.  A complete rewrite of this chapter and Appendix C is
recommended.  In view of the deficiencies in inspection and
testing that were exposed in Phase I of the Inquiry, it is
imperative that guidance should be clear and unambiguous.
Reference should be made to the ISE report "Appraisal of Sports
Grounds" and to "Crush Barrier Strengths and Spacings", Home
Office, March 1973, both of which contain a wealth of useful
information.
23.  The conclusions of the Technical Working Party following
discussion of Dr Nicholson's paper on Chapter 4 and 5 are
summarised in paragraphs 13, 15-22 and 25-29 of WP89(M)2;
paragraphs 2(iv) and 3 of WP89(M)3;  and paragraphs 15-18 of the
Technical Working Party Report.  Note that each barrier should be
tested at intervals of not more than four years and less as
determined by inspection.

24.   A model format prepared by Dr Nicholson and Mr Dickson",
Inspection and Testing of Crush Barriers and Handrails", is
attached.  It emphasises the importance of visual inspections,
particularly where corrosion is visible or suspected, calls for
certified records of inspection and tests, and sets out the best
practice of structural testing.

CHAPTER 10 - ROOFED STANDS WITH SEATED ACCOMMODATION

25.   The principal recommendation is that guidance on temporary
structures should be transferred to a separate chapter (Technical
Working Party Report, Recommendation 11).  See also Mr Bush's
paper of 22nd November, 1989.

CHAPTER 11 - FIRE SAFETY

26.  Material in this chapter on evacuation should be co­
ordinated with chapter 6 on egress.   The networked plan of
entrances and exits recommended above for each ground should
include escape routes in emergencies.   Full account should be
taken of the relationships between normal and emergency
provisions in drawing up evacuation plans.

27.   Attention should be drawn to the importance of clear lines
of authority in determining the requirements for fire safety, as
for other requirements for safety.   The Technical Working Party
considers that the certifying authority should be identified as
the responsible body (Technical Working Party Report paragraph
42) .

28.  Reference should be made to the four general documents
identified in the index accompanying these notes.  (North
Yorkshire County Council paper, 1952 Fire Grading of Buildings,
ISE paper, Building Research Establishment Report by Professor
Canter.

CHAPTER 12 - COMMUNICATIONS

29. A substantial expansion of the chapter is recommended in
line with paragraphs 44 and 45 and Recommendation 17 of the
Technical Working Party Report.  See also Professor Maunder's
note of 28 October 1989 and Mr Stickley's note of 16 November
1989.

30.  Particular attention should be drawn to the provision,
capacities, effectiveness and testing of equipment in the Police
Control Room, in the Club Communications Centre and in the hands
of police and stewards inside and outside the ground.  Secure
means of communication between turnstiles and the Police Control
Room are essential to ensure that admittances to enclosures are
limited strictly to specified safe capacities.  This requirement
should be emphasised.  Guidance should be given on the
requirement of back-up systems, and on special means of
communicating via public address systems during emergencies.
References to CCTV should be strengthened.

CHAPTER 14 - CROWD CONTROL

31.  The Working Party considered that the balance between safety
and crowd control presented in this chapter is unsatisfactory.
Guidance on safety should be presented more positively.
Substantial redrafting is recommended, including co-ordination
with the succeeding chapter on Pitch Perimeter Fence/Wall.
Requirements of safety and crowd control at the approaches to
grounds, especially at turnstiles, should be incorporated.

32. WP89(M)4 paragraph 29 summarises discussions based on the
paper by Mr Bush and Mr Carter, of 22 November 1989.  It notes
two paragraphs of the Green Guide which gave particular concern.
The first is paragraph 206, which advocates internal sub­
divisions of terraces in the interests of crowd control.  Such
sub-divisions present serious dangers.  The paragraph should be
revised in the light of Hillsborough.  No sub-divisions should be
permitted without reliable means of counting the movement of
spectators.

33.  The second is paragraph 209, which states that "access to
the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in normal
circumstances", followed by qualifications that the police should
have access from the pitch to the terraces and, lastly, that the
pitch should be used in serious emergencies.   The emphasis is
clearly on crowd control, and it is recommended that the
paragraph be rewritten with a substantially changed emphasis in
favour of safety;  inter alia, not only should the current
reference to spikes and barbed wire be removed, but spikes and
barbed wire should be expressly prohibited.   (Technical Working
Party Recommendation 6).

34.  Clear, prominent and unambiguous signs marking turnstiles,
other entrances, exits and routes to identified enclosures and
stands form an important aspect of crowd control, and should be
treated comprehensively in the Green Guide.

CHAPTER 15 - PITCH PERIMETER FENCE/WALL

35.  Paragraphs 17-22 and Recommendations 5-7 of the Technical
Working Party Report set out the conclusions of the Technical
Working Party.  See also Dr Nicholson's paper discussed on 2
November 1989.

36. Attention should be drawn in the Green Guide to the general
principles of separation outlined in paragraphs 17 and 18 of the
Report.  The Green Guide should also include recommendations on
the size, design and disposition of perimeter barriers.   It is
imperative that exit gates or gaps providing emergency access to
the pitch should be defined for each ground such that they allow
evacuation of an enclosure within a prescribed time, taking into
account the capacity and the dimensions of the enclosure.
37.       The strength criteria and test procedures for crush barriers
and     for perimeter fences should be distinguished one from the
oth e r .

CHAPTER 16 - ESTIMATION OF SAFE GROUND CAPACITY

38. A comprehensive rewrite is recommended.     A full summary of
the Technical Working Party's conclusions and recommendations is
given in its Report.   See also the papers by Professor Maunder
(31   October 1989) and by Mr Stickley (16 November 1989).

39.    Calculations of the safe capacity of terraced enclosures and
viewing slopes depend on a large number of parameters.     The Green
Guide should identify all parameters clearly.    It should
recommend the procedure by means of which the capacity is to be
estimated.   The procedure should be set out in a form that can
readily be followed, preferably as a simple step-by-step
sequence.   Characteristic numerical examples should be provided,
and they should be accompanied by explanatory not es .

40.  In view of the move towards more seating accommodation,
urgent consideration should be given to recommended
configurations and allowable densities of seating.

CHAPTER 17 - RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES

41.  The chapter should be co-ordinated with chapters 5, 6 and 7.
It should be expanded to consider flow rates along complete
ingress and egress routes as well as through component parts.
Guidance should be included on flow rates relevant to chapter 11
dealing within emergency evacuation.

ANNEX C

Revision of this annex should be considered in the light of the
foregoing notes on chapters 4 and 9.  Se also WP89(M)4,
paragraphs 25-28.

ADDITIONS

1.   A separate chapter on provisions for disabled spectators
     should be included.

2.   A separate chapter on auxiliary power supplies, with special
     reference to auxiliary lighting, should replace paragraphs
     166-169 of the current Green Guide.  See also WP89(M)4,
     paragraph 16.

3.   A bibliography for further reference should be considered.
An example prepared by Mr Dickson is attached.

On     leaving          the       car,       we    had a walk a r o u n d              and     found         something             to     eat,

there        was    any       police          presence             during       the    time       I left        the      car a n d

On     returning             to    the       ground       which would              have      been       at    the     time         the

our     way    to       the       turnstiles.                 At    t h is     time    I never          witnessed             any

fighting           or    drunkeness.

There        was    no       queues          at    the    turnstiles             where       I recall           was      a     police

presence,           but       they       gave       us    no       direction.

From      the     time we              entered          the      ground          I never        noticed          any     fighting         or

at    this      time      I thought                they were               pinching        seats       like         theydid        the    y e ar

The      players         then          came       on    to      the    pitch        to    start       the     garne so m y a t t e n t i o n

wall      in f r o n t        of     us,       and    they        looked a b s o l u t e l y                exhausted,               they asked

us    if we         had      got     anything             to    drink,            the     only        t h i n g we        had was          two

cartons           of     orange       which          we    gladly          gave         them         because         they        looked         in an

horrid         state,         on e    of       these       supporters                   was      a    girl      who       was       sobbing          her

heart        out       and she        intimated                t h at     people          had        died      o ve r     th e      terraces,

which        I found          hard        to a c c e p t ,       but       only         because            I. di dn * t j o ^ n t         to.        Then

other        supporters              started          to       rip      s om e     th e    boardi n gvf way                from       the

people were                 alive     or       not.

Then      I mentioned                to    my    friend                          that      there must                be    something             we

could        do     to      help.

So we        both made             our     way       towards          a    canteen             area        in y f h e     South Stand                were

in t u r n s        drinking          from       this          cup.        I made          three           similar         journeys             to    get

water        and       at    no    time        was    I aproached                  by a n y b o d y         to a s s i s t          me.

                    After         about        h al f     an    hour      I was          standing            with      a group         of a b o u t       SO

                    Liverpool             supporters              in f r o n t         of w h e r e       I was        sitting.

                    At     this      time        I heard          my     friend                      shouting           to me        to      join    her        b a ck

                    in the          stand,        which         I decided              to    do,     as      I was      in the         stand making                my

                    way     to                    I heard          a Forrest                supporter           shout       to      this      group       of

                    Liverpool             supporters              something              like      "81 o o d y       a n i m a l s 11 I t h e n      ha d

                    reached                       and      entered            the      tunnel        that       leads       to      the      back    of     the

                    s ta n d ,      when       I remember               a glass          bottle         coming from           behind           me a n d

                    smashing             in f r o n t      of     us     in the          t un n e l ,     w h i c h made      us      rundown         the

                    tunnel          because          we    thought            t ha t     some      trouble           had    started           between           the

                    f a n s.        We    ran     straight              out    of      the    ground         and       made      our w a y         back     to     the

                    car.It        would         have       been about               4.25pm when              we      left     the      ground        w h i c h was

                    t he    time         we    ran      down      the     tu n n e l .

                    On     reaching            the      car we          eventually            made        our     way      b a ck     to              and

                                     home.

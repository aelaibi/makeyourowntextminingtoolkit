ADDITIONAL PAIN BY THESE GRATUITOUS AND OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WE
CHOOSE TO RENEW THE SPECIAL feONDS FORMED BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND

REGISTERED CHARITY NO. 328187
The Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust
REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES




In the past year we have made further progress towards completing our task o f distributing the funds
which arose from the appeal following the disaster at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

In June 1992 we completed the distribution of the Appeal’s Discretionary Trust which had received some
£11.8 million in donations, all of which was distributed to those who were bereaved or injured in the
disaster. Since then we have been dealing with the funds which came into the Charitable Trust and we
have supported projects that are appropriate to commemorate those who died at Hillsborough, and to
commemorate the generosity of those who contributed to the appeal.

The schemes which had already been initiated with our support are all progressing well. Some 10,000
members of amateur football clubs have now been trained in emergency aid in the Hillsborough/Football
Association scheme, run in conjunction with St. John Ambulance. Courses have been run by 66 of the
League clubs, by 25 County F. A.s and by a number of local authorities.

The well established schemes of youth development in Merseyside and Nottingham are now entering their
third year, and the Sheffield scheme has successfully completed its first year.

The memorial bursaries established at the Universities in Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham have
provided invaluable assistance to students who are disabled or otherwise disadvantaged in pursuing their
studies. We have been encouraged by this to extend the scope of these bursaries. The bursary funds at
the six universities have been increased, and we are now in the process of extending the bursaries to cover
the remainder of the Higher Education sector and to the Further Education sector in the three areas. As a
result a memorial bursary scheme has been established at the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education, and
Liverpool City Council have agreed to administer a scheme for students at the nine colleges of further
education on Merseyside. The Sheffield College is the only college of F.E. in the city and a bursary
scheme has been set up there. There are a number of F.E. colleges in Nottingham and discussions are
currently taking place about suitable arrangements for administering a bursary scheme.

The most significant new initiative in the past year has been the provision of funds for the development of
training courses for doctors, paramedics and members of the emergency services. This development is
being undertaken by the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh and the British Association for Immediate
Care. A three day Pre Hospital Emergency Care Course is aimed principally at doctors but has also been
attended by senior members of the emergency services. Four such courses were run in 1993 and 10
courses are being run in 1994. A two day Pre Hospital First Aid Certificate Course is in the process of
development. This will be aimed at developing the concepts of inter-disciplinary team work at accident
centres and would cover not only medical personnel but also those from Fire, Police and the Voluntary
Aid Services.

Following the same theme, a grant from the Turst is supporting a new ‘Lifesaver Programme’ of training
by the St. John Ambulance which is aimed at the general public and^ which was launched in September.
The programme is specifically dedicated to the memory of those who died at Hillsborough.

Further small donations have been made to voluntary bodies who were involved in the response to the
disaster together with contributions to the local branches of St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross
in three areas. W e have also made a small number of donations to organisations who cater for young
people to enable them to provide facilities for disabled or disadvantaged youngsters.

Finally, we have helped with the provision of facilities to enable blind and visually impaired people to
receive commentaries on the football matches at Anfield and Hillsborough.




                                                                                                          2

REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES




O f the £1.9 million which came into the Charitable Trust less than £300,000 was uncommitted as we
entered what we intend to be the final year o f the Trust. We have subsequently agreed to support the
development by the Royal College of Surgeons of England of a training programme for doctors and other
medical staff directed at improving care in the immediate aftermath of injury and trauma. We are also
exploring further initiatives in training and research in areas which have particular relevance in the light
of the disaster at Hillsborough. We expect to complete the distribution of the Trust’s funds by making
other grants and contributions which are brpadly in line with the general principles which we have
followed to date.

STATEMENT OF THE TRUSTEES’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE
ACCOUNTS




The Trust Deed requires the Trustees to obtain accounts for each year. The Trustees have determined that
the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial transactions of the trust during the year and of the
disposition at the end of the year of the assets and liabilities and contain the information as specified in
relevant regulations. In doing so they are required to:

•    select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;

•    state within the accounts whether they are prepared in accordance with the Statem ent of
     Recommended Practise No 2 Accounting by Charities (SORP 2) or, if theyare not, toindicate any
     material departures;

•    prepare the accounts in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed.

The Trustees are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, which disclose the financial
transactions and the assets and liabilities with reasonable accuracy. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets o f the scheme and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.




                                                                                                          4

   REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
   The T rustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust

   We have audited the accounts on pages 6 to 8 which have been prepared on the basis of the accounting
   policies set out on page 8.

   Respective responsibilities of the trustees and auditors
   As described on page 4 the Trustees are responsible for obtaining accounts. It is our responsibility to
   form an independent opinion, based on our audit, of those accounts and to report our opinion to you.

   Basis of opinion
   We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
   An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
   accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by or on behalf
   o f the Trustees in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
   to the Trust’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

   We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which             we
   considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that    the
   accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.      In
   forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in          the
   accounts.

   Opinion
   In our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial transactions of the trust for the year
   ended 30 June 1994, and of the disposition at that date of its assets and liabilities.

REGISTERED CHARITY NO. 328187
The Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust
REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES




In the past year we have made further progress towards completing our task o f distributing the funds
which arose from the appeal following the disaster at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

In June 1992 we completed the distribution of the Appeal’s Discretionary Trust which had received some
£11.8 million in donations, all of which was distributed to those who were bereaved or injured in the
disaster. Since then we have been dealing with the funds which came into the Charitable Trust and we
have supported projects that are appropriate to commemorate those who died at Hillsborough, and to
commemorate the generosity of those who contributed to the appeal.

The schemes which had already been initiated with our support are all progressing well. Some 10,000
members of amateur football clubs have now been trained in emergency aid in the Hillsborough/Football
Association scheme, run in conjunction with St. John Ambulance. Courses have been run by 66 of the
League clubs, by 25 County F.A.s and by a number of local authorities.

The well established schemes of youth development in Merseyside and Nottingham are now entering their
third year, and the Sheffield scheme has successfully completed its first year.

The memorial bursaries established at the Universities in Liverpool, Sheffield and Nottingham have
provided invaluable assistance to students who are disabled or otherwise disadvantaged in pursuing their
studies. We have been encouraged by this to extend the scope of these bursaries. The bursary funds at
the six universities have been increased, and we are now in the process o f extending the bursaries to cover
the remainder of the Higher Education sector and to the Further Education sector in the three areas. As a
result a memorial bursary scheme has been established at the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education, and
Liverpool City Council have agreed to administer a scheme for students at the nine colleges of further
education on Merseyside. The Sheffield College is the only college of F.E. in the city and a bursary
scheme has been set up there. There are a number of F.E. colleges in Nottingham and discussions are
currently taking place about suitable arrangements for administering a bursary scheme.

The most significant new initiative in the past year has been the provision of funds for the development of
training courses for doctors, paramedics and members of the emergency services. This development is
being undertaken by the Royal College of Surgeons Edinburgh and the British Association for Immediate
Care. A three day Pre Hospital Emergency Care Course is aimed principally at doctors but has also been
attended by senior members of the emergency services. Four such courses were run in 1993 and 10
courses are being run in 1994. A two day Pre Hospital First Aid Certificate Course is in the process of
development. This will be aimed at developing the concepts of inter-disciplinary team work at accident
centres and would cover not only medical personnel but also those from Fire, Police and the Voluntary
Aid Services.

Following the same theme, a grant from the Turst is supporting a new ‘Lifesaver Programme’ of training
by the St. John Ambulance which is aimed at the general public andp which was launched in September.
The programme is specifically dedicated to the memory of those who died at Hillsborough.

Further small donations have been made to voluntary bodies who were involved in the response to the
disaster together with contributions to the local branches of St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross
in three areas. We have also made a small number of donations to organisations who cater for young
people to enable them to provide facilities for disabled or disadvantaged youngsters.

Finally, we have helped with the provision of facilities to enable blind and visually impaired people to
receive commentaries on the football matches at Anfield and Hillsborough.




                                                                                                           2
The Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust
REPORT OF THE TRUSTEES




O f the £1.9 million which came into the Charitable Trust less than £300,000 was uncommitted as we
entered what we intend to be the final year o f the Trust. We have subsequently agreed to support the
development by the Royal College of Surgeons of England of a training programme for doctors and other
medical staff directed at improving care in the immediate aftermath of injury and trauma. We are also
exploring further initiatives in training and research in areas which have particular relevance in the light
of the disaster at Hillsborough. We expect to complete the distribution of the Trust’s funds by making
other grants and contributions which are broadly in line with the general principles which we have
followed to date.

The Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust
STATEMENT OF THE TRUSTEES’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT OF THE
ACCOUNTS




The Trust Deed requires the Trustees to obtain accounts for each year. The Trustees have determined that
the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial transactions of the trust during the year and o f the
disposition at the end of the year of the assets and liabilities and contain the information as specified in
relevant regulations. In doing so they are required to:

•    select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;

•    state within the accounts whether they are prepared in accordance with the Statem ent of
     Recommended Practise No 2 Accounting by Charities (SORP 2) or, if they are not, to indicate any
     material departures;

•    prepare the accounts in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Deed.

The Trustees are responsible for maintaining proper accounting records, which disclose the financial
transactions and the assets and liabilities with reasonable accuracy. They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the scheme and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.




                                                                                                           4

   REPORT OF THE AUDITORS
   The Trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Charitable Trust

   We have audited the accounts on pages 6 to 8 which have been prepared on the basis of the accounting
   policies set out on page 8.

   Respective responsibilities of the trustees and auditors
   As described on page 4 the Trustees are responsible for obtaining accounts. It is our responsibility to
   form an independent opinion, based on our audit, of those accounts and to report our opinion to you.

   Basis of opinion
   We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
   An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
   accounts. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by or on behalf
   of the Trustees in the preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate
   to the Trust’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.

   We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
   considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
   accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In
   forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
   accounts.

   Opinion
   In our opinion the accounts give a true and fair view of the financial transactions of the trust for the year
   ended 30 June 1994, and of the disposition at that date of its assets and liabilities.

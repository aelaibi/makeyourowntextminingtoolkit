AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

GENERAL LACK OF O R G AN IS A TI ON .   THE POLICE WERE TOO LATE IN GETTING INTO THE

TERRACES TO HELP ANYONE.        THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION,      BUT PEOPLE IN

THE TERRACES EVEN SHOUTED AT 2.30PM          (1430) FOR H E L P , BUT WERE IGNORED BY THE

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) THE THOUGHT OF A PITCH INVASION SEEMED TO ENEAGE POLICE ORDERING PEOPLE TO

GET BACK     INTO THE TERRACES AS THEY WERE TRYING TO GET OUT

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS ONLY ONE AMBULANCE THERE WHICH WAS DIABOLICAL.            THERE WERE A LOT OF

 POLICE THERE EVENTUALLY,     IT TOOK TOO LONG TO CUT THE WIRE MESH DOWN TO FREE

 PEOPLE AND THERE W E R E N ’T ENOUGH MEDICAL PEOPLE TO TREAT THE INJURED.         MOST OF

 THE RESUSCITATION WAS BY POLICE AND FANS.         ALSO,   I D I D N ’T SEE ANY POLICE IN

AUTHORITY, NONE WITH STRIPES.

G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

JfcT I ’VE READ IN THE PAPERS ABOUT PEOPLE ROBBING THE DEAD AND URINATING IN

THE STANDS, WELL T H A T ’S ALL RUBBISH.   I D I D N ’T SEE ANYONE DOING THAT.      I SAW

SOME PEOPLE GIVING THE POLICE HASSLE BUT THEY WERE JUST UPSET BECAUSE OF

 INJURED FRIENDS OR RELATIVES AND THE POLICE WERE HOLDING BACK, THEY D I D N ’T

STRIKE THE POLICE THOUGH.

 MINUTES TO OPEN THE GATE AT THE FRONT AND WHEN       THEY DID ITWAS C O U N T E R ­

 PRODUCTIVE BECAUSE EVERYBODY APPEARED TO RUSH FOR IT.         I ALSO REMEMBER HEARING

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE IN C ID E N T WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE I N I T I A L    RESPONSE WAS SLOW BUT ONCE PEOPLE REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

 ^E E L     THAT BY THE TIM E       I   ARRIVED AT THE GROUND,    THE POL IC E HAD LOST CONTROL

.OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE                 I N S ID E THE GROUNDED I DN_* TJ<NOW

WHAT WAS GOING ON OUTSID E.

 IT    SEEMED THAT THE PROBLEM OF CRUSHING OUTSIDE WAS TRANSFERRED IN S ID E WHEN THE

GATE WAS OPENED.            I   FEEL THE CRUSH COULD HAVE BEEN HANDLED EASIER OUTSIDE

BECAUSE THERE I S MORE ROOM.

 THE ONLY THTIxlfj T                 NUMBE rH ^                      ASSAULTED.    THIS WAS

 MORE AGGRESSION FROM THE FANS THAN ACTUALLY ATTACKING THEM, DUE TO THE

 CONDUCT OF THE PRESS.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE IN C ID E N T WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 AS THE MATCH WAS STOPPED AT FIRST PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE

 TO ESCAPE THE CRUSH IN THE TERRACES,       BUT THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK.

 IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE FANS WERE TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO THE POLICE WHAT WAS

^ A P P E N I N G BUT THE POLICE FAILED TO REACT,   THEY D I D N ’T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS

 GOING ON.

 THE FANS WERE SHOUTING FOR THE SMALL GATES LEADINO..QNXQ THE PITCH TO BE

 OPENED BUT NONE OF THE POLICE SEEMED PREPARED T O MAKE A DEC I S I ON ..TO. DO T H I S .

 AT THE TIME THE FANS WERE GETTING ONTO THE PITCH TO ESCAPE THE TERRACES,              THE

 POLICE SEEMED MORE INTERESTED IN KEEPING THEM OFF THE PITCH INSTEAD OF

 ASSISTING PEOPLE OUT OF THE TERRACES.

 I THINK THAT POLICING AT FOOTBALL MATCHES OVER THE PAST HAS CREATED A BAD

 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE POLICE AND FANS AND IF ATTITUDES ARE TO BE ADJUSTED

 ON BOTH SIDES IT IS NECESSARY FOR A MORE POSITIVE APPROACH TOWARDS WELL

 8 ® A V E D SUPPORTERES TO BE ADOPTED.

 Q34

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I   THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS TOTAL DISORGANISED.          THERE SEEMED TO BE A TOTAL

 LACK OF _COMMUNICATIONS WHICH
                           <**'
                                I FEEL MADE THE INCIDENT WORSE.

  ( ||M       .
 ALTHOUGH I HAVE SAID THAT THE INCIDENT WAS DISORGANISED,            I DO APPRECIATE

 BECAUSE OF MY OCCUPATION THAT A MAJOR INCIDENT OF THIS NATURE IS EXTREMELY

 DIFFICULT TO HANDLE WITHOUT ANY WARNING,           PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TOTALLY BY

 SURPRISE.

G-15

 Q43

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 I WAS WATCHING THAT AREA.   I COULD SEE THAT BOTH CORNER AREAS WERE EMPTY AND

 JUST KEPT GOING FORWARD.

 NO.

 043

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,           IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 I SAW IT YES,     IT WAS CAUSED BY A WHOLE LOT OF SUPPORTERS PUSHING INTO THE TWO

 CENTRE PENS AND FORCING EVERYBODY FORWARDS.            IT CLOSED EVERYBODY UP EVEN

 TIGHTER.     T H A T ’S ONLY MY OPINION.    I D I D N ’T ACTUALLY WITNESS IT.   I WAS HOPING

 AT THE TIME THAT THE END PENS WERE GOING TO FILL UP.              I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING

 TO BE A POOR TURN OUT AT FIRST UNTIL I REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

Q1S

 G32

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO NOTHNG.

 QS3

£      YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED.

 FROM WHERE I WAS SITTING I COULD SEE THAT SOME FANS WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OUT

 ONTO THE PITCH AND I SAW POLICEMEN PUSHING THEM BACK.                     THEY PROBABLY D I D N ’T

 KNOW AT THAT STAGE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.                 I   SAW SOME FANS THEN TRYING TO      RIP

 THE FENCING AWAY.                  THEY WERE STOPPED ALSO BUT AFTER ABOUT 20 OR 30 SECONDS

 THE POLICE BEGAN TO HELP.

 Q53A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE SAME GAME THE PREVIOUS YEAR?

 ^p,     WE WERE IN PEN 4 LAST YEAR, TOWARDS THE BACK AND IT WAS BAD ENOUGH THEN

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 LAST YEAR THERE WERE POLICE LINED UP OUTSIDE THE EXTERIOR GATE, THEY WERE

 CHECKING YOUR TICKETS.                IF YOU D I D N ’T HAVE ONE YOU D I D N ’T GET THROUGH THE

 GATE.     THERE WAS NONE OF THAT THIS YEAR.

 NONE OF US COULD BELIEVE THAT WE HAD                 BEEN GIVEN THE SMALLER END AGAIN.        WE

 HAVE MORE FANS AND                 I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE SPION KOP END.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED»

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FROM MY SEAT IN THE NORTH STAND I COULD CLEARLY SEE THE CROWD CRUSH DEVELOP

 FROM 1430 ONWARDS.     SO MUCH SO THAT I DO NOT RECOLLECT ACTUALLY WATCHING

 ANY OF THE FOOTBALL.     IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME THAT THERE WAS A SEVERE PROBLEM

 AND I FEEL THAT    THE POLICE REACTION WAS TOO SLOW.   INDEED NOTHING OF ANY

 SUBSTANCE WAS ACHIEVED U NTIL THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIR E BRIGADE.

 I FEEL THAT FOOTBALL. SUPPORTERS IN GENERAL SHOULD RECEIVE BETTER TREATMENT

 FROM OFFICIALDOM.          I ALSO FEEL THAT THE CONDITIONS AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

 SHOULD BE VASTLY IMPROVED.         THE FENCES SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN AND MORE

 CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TOWARDS PUBLIC SAFETY.

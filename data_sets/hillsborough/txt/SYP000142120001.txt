Q13.    IS T H E R E A N Y T H I N G Y O U W I S H TO SAY A BO UT TH E EVE NT S OF THE

        15 A PR IL     1989?



<1)    About 4 years ago             I a t t e n d e d a semi-f ina l   at H i l l s b o r o u g h

i n vo lv in g Live rp oo l     that     time   I remember       seeing Liverpool          Police

Officers       the r e .    I think      this helped.       On 15 April         1989 I didn't            see

an y L i v er po ol   Po li ce Officers.



(2)     The    co nnecting       gate    be tw e e n the   two   courty ard s    behind the West

S t a n d as   to my r e m e m b r a n c e   been closed all       the time.        The gate

throughout        this m a t c h was open.



(3)      At     a bo ut 12.30 am two of the t u rns til es w h i c h could have ser ve d

the W e s t    side stand were          fe nc ed off and used        to serve the N o r t h Stand.



<4)      By     a bo ut 2 . 1 5 pm we had only sold a few programmes,                    about 3 0 0 to

500,     it     a p p e a r e d a very slow      rate for such a big match.              Whe n       I m ov ed

to my next        posi ti on be tw e e n 2.2 5 a n d 3. 1 5       pm I sold about          1,000

programmes.



NB                           went    near    to the g y m n a s i u m ar ea to take        cash       into

pay a n d saw several           deceased.       This has d i s t r e s s e d him greatly.

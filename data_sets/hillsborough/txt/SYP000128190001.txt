              I am 27 years        old,    I have been a Liv er poo l              football          supporter    for many

              years,     and I now live at the above address with my fiancee

              On Saturday,        the   15th of April          1989,     (150489)       I at t e n d e d the

              Liver poo l,     N o t t i n g h a m football    m a tc h at H i l l s b o r o u g h    in Sheffield.

              I bought    a north stand ticket                for    14 from A n f i e l d before going             to the

              game   but ex ch ang ed the ticket on arrival                    at the      ground for a Lep pings

              Lane   sta nding ticket.

              I tr av ell ed on the        coach to the game with

                                          Kirkby,

                                                                    K irkby and

              Kirkby.     We were       not su bj ect ed to any travel                delays.

              Ot he rs   did drink a few cans of               lager on the          coach but         I did not see

              any drunkeness         on route to the ground.

              We were droppe d by the            coach som ewhere           in the town centre and then
                                                                                              PAGE      2


went    to the Beehiv e Public House.               We did not        receive or see any

Pol ic e escort on route to the ground.

I a r r i v e d at   the entrance    to the gr o u n d at          1435 hours a n d could see

that there was just a mass of             people aroun d the turnstiles*                  no orderl y

queuing.       I saw one    pol iceman on horseback                shouting    to the   crowd to

push back and         I could see one foot          patrol    officer who ap pe ar ed to be

stuck    in the middle of the         crowds


I did not see any stewards outside the turnstiles*

Due to the size of the         crowd     I M/as not able            to enter    through a

turns til e and       it was then we saw that a blue                 concertina gate was open

to the ri ght -ha nd side of the turnstile an d people                        were   going through

into the ground.

I did not witnes s        this gate     being opened.

I en ter ed the ground throu gh this            gate,     no-one       took my ticket       from me

and    I have since handed this to the Police.                       Now    produced as

(Exhibit                    (Ref*              >.    Once     inside the gro un d         I did not

wi tne ss   any supporters     consuming alcohol.

I then en ter ed the tunnel          towards    the gro un d         into   pens 3 a n d 4*

I did not see any         police or stewards at the entranc e to the tunnel.

I had free       passage along      the tunnel.        At the end of the tunnel               I went

str ai gh t ahead towards the front,            gr a d u a l l y    pushing my way throu gh the

people sta nding about.

I am unable to say whether            I was    in pen 3 or 4.

I think     it was about 3 pm (1500            hrs)     at this point.

I remember wo rki ng my way          right to the front              of the pen      behind the

goal»

At this time the         pressure    behind us was           bad. I remember          that this

seemed to happ en straight ao/ay.               It did not seem to be a              gradual

build-up.        I remember that the game had starte d at this time.

At this     point     I M/as standing   by a ma n      I knoM/ to be                            from
                                                                                                 PAGE


                       Liverpool

I then saw a man being                passed over my head towards the                pitch.      I

a s si st ed    in passing     the man towards           the f r o n t , he then went     to the

right of me and then passed onto the                      pitch.     I noticed that he was a

large man with a large stomach,                   his shirt was all          pulled up I think h

m ay have       been blue     in colour.         I could hear       people shouting,          " H e ’s

dead."

I could see that his face was blue                   in colour       but    in the    panic that

fo llo wed      I cannot des cribe him any further.

I believe at this stage that the game was still                            on.

At this        point   the   pressure was        so bad that       I could only take very

short    breaths,       alt ho ug h    I still    felt    pretty calm.            I then noticed

that    there M/as a short m an standing                 next   to me M/ho was screaming              that

he c o u l d n ’t breath.       He was       standing to my left hand side act ual ly

touching me.           His head was         pushed against my chest with

the back of his head agains t me.                   His    head was       pushed down so that            I

could not see his face.

I am 5 ’9 tall and this man's                 head only came up to my chest.

I cannot        really describe        the ma n other       than to say he had brown                 long

wa vy hair and was quite              plump.

I wo uld say he M/as between SO and 30 y e a r s                   old.

The man then went quiet and slumpe d down to the                           floor.     I did not see

him again.

I then saw a policeman sta nding on the fencing shoutin g to the crowd

to push back.           At this,      the    pressure     behind seem ed to su ddenly ease

and    I then lost my footing and fell                   backwards onto the terracing.                   I

remember        that   I fell onto       the concrete and was             under   the barrier.

Other    people that were             in front of me also fell             and landed on top of

me.

I was    then pulled out from under the barrier                      by people behind me and
                                                                                              PAGE        4


              a s si st ed to stand up*      I notice d that    I had lost one of my shoes,        the

              left one,      size eight *    It is a brown "chucka" style boot.          I do not

              M/ant it back,

              I then pushed my way back           up the terracing and was helped      by other

              fans     to climb up into the West Stand.

              I was not badly injured other than bruising to my chest and general

              body an d left      the gro und of my own accord.         I am unable   to say what

              time this was.

              I am 27 years old, 5 ’9 tall,         I weigh approximately      12 stone 6 p o u n d s .

              At the game       I M/as weari ng   a tan leather    bomber jacket an d blue    jeans *

              My hair       is fairly short and brown      in colour.

              For      a       period    of    two    years       I served          as       Staff       Officer      to     the      then

Sheffield           Central             Division,          I was          responsible                for    the    policing          of

I    remained           as    the       Deputy       Divisional             Commander                until    October          1985       when

I was       promoted              to    the    rank       of    Chief       Superintendent                   and    appointed

Divisional              Commander             of    the    Division             where       1       remained       until       the     27

March       1989,        when          I was       transferred             as    Divisional                Commander       to       the

Barnsley           Division.

During        my    time          in    the    Sheffield             North       Division,             as    Deputy       Divisional

Commander           and       Divisional             Commander,             I was       deeply             involved       in    the
planning          and       command          of     operations                associated             with       Sheffield          Wednesday

Football          club       and       in    fact        in    1987       was       the       Officer          commanding          the       semi

final       between          Coventry             City        and       Leeds       United       and       in    1988       the    match

between          Liverpool             and       Nottingham              Forest.          In a d d i t i o n ,        in    1984       during

the    Miners          dispite,             I was        involved             in    the       policing          of    picket       lines          in

Nottinghamshire,                      Grgreave,           Doncaster                and    Barnsley             and    at    times       took

control          of    the       Force       Control           Room       dealing             with    the       deployment             of

personnel             to    picketting              situations.

So    far    as       both       the    '1987 a n d           1988       semi       finals       are       concerned,             I was

directly          responsible                for       the     planning             and       liaison          with    the       management

of    Sheffield             Wednesday             Football              Club       and    the    Football             Association,                 On

both    occasions                negotiations                 were       entered          into       concerning             the

allocation             of    seating             areas        to    opposing             fans    and       the       decision          was

taken       that       one       team       would        be    allocated             the       South       Side       and    the       Kop       and

the    other          team       the    North          Side        and    the       West       Side       and    Lappings          Ln

Terraces.              The       decision           was       based       on       the    geographical                location          of       the

Stadium          and       was    in a n         effort        to       ensure       complete             segregation             of

supporters             to    prevent             c o n f r o n t a t i on      and       publi c d isord er .

Consideration                was       given        to    other          methods          of    deployment,                but    on    balance

it    was    felt          that       this       was     the       most       appropriate             separation..

In    connection             with       both        the       semi       final       in       1987    and       1988,       this       policy

as    followed             and    the       operations              were       successful.

In    1989       during          the    week        prior          to    Monday          20    March       19 8 9 ,    I was

approached             by    Mr       Graham        McKRELL             the    Secretary             of    the       Sheffield

Wednesday             Football          Club,          who     indicated             that       once       again       he    might          be

asked       to    stage          the    semi        final,          possibly             between          Liverpool          and

Nottingham             Forest,              He    asked        if       I would          be    able       to    confirm          that       we

could       Police          such       an    event        and       I    indicated             that       we    would       receive          any

proposal          in a       favourable                manner           should       the       situation             arise,        I again

indicated             that       if    we    did       stage        that       event,          I would          ask    that       the       same
                                                                                                                                      PAGE            4


segregation             procedures              were    utilised          as    in    previous              years       and       that

Liverpool          would       be       allocated        the       North       Stand*          West       Stand        and       Leppings

Ln    Terrace          and    Nottingham              Forest       the    Kop    and       South          Stand        as    in       the

previous          years.

On    Monday       SO    Mach        1989,       I was       again       contacted             by    Mr     McKRELL          who

confirmed          that       he     had       been    asked       by    the    Football             Association                 to    stage

the       semi    final       between           Liverpool          and    Nottingham                Forest.            He    did       say

that       the    Football           Association             had    asked       if    the       allocation              of       seats

could       be    reversed           in    that       they    would       like       more       facilities              for

Liverpool          fans*           I once        again       pointed       out       the       reasons          for     the       decision

taken       the    previous             years     and    after          confirmation                of    the     ACC

(Operations?             Mr    W W JACKSON,              I confirmed             that          there        was    no       possibility

of    change       and       that       that     was    the       only    manner          in w h i c h        I would            be

prepared          to    Police          such     an    event,       Mr   McKRELL           indicated              that       he       would

have       to    take    the       matter        back    to       the    Football          Association                 before          the

final       decision          M/as      reached,

I believe          it w a s        later        that    same       day    that       Mr    McKRELL            contacted               me    and

said       that    the       Football           Association             had accepted                the     position             and       that

we    would       be    asked        to    Police       the       semi    final       on       the       15 A p r i l       1989

(150489)          and    that        the       ticket    allocations             would          be       in a c c o r d a n c e        with

our       plans    for       the     previous          year.

As    a    consequence             of     this    information             I spoke          to       Superintendent                    MURRAY

and       Inspector          SEWELL        at    Hammerton          Rd    Police          Station           and    at       3pm       (1500)

that       day    made       arrangements              for    a    meeting       to       be    called          for     Wednesday                22

March       1989       (220389)           in    order    that       early       planning             discussions                 for       the

event       could       take       place.

Conscious          of    the       fact        that    I was       scheduled          to       take       command           of    a    new

Division          on    the    27       March     1989       (210389),          I called             upon       the     proposed             new

Divisional             Commander,              Chief    Superintendent                D    G    DUCKENFIELD,                 to       attend

that       meeting       in    order           that    continuity          might          remain          and     he    could
continue          with     the       planning         which       would       be    in    his    domain.           The

meeting          took    place           at   1Qarr. < 1 0 0 0 )       on    22    March       1989    (220389)          at

Hammerton          Rd    Police          Station       and       involved          all    interested             parties,

including          the     heads         of   Operations           and       Traffic       D i v ision*,         the    Senior

Officers          whould        be    involved         in    the       operation,          the    Support          Staff

responsible             for     preparing            the    Operational             Order       and    representatives                of

British          Rail,     Public         Transport          and       the    Highways          Authority          of    the

County       Council.

At    that       meeting        initial         plans       were       made       concerning          action       to    be    taken

and    in    particular              consideration               was    given       to    the    mode       of    travel       of

supporters           and      representation                was    made       by    the    British          Rail

representatives                 for      Liverpool          to    be    brought          into    the    Midland          Station

in    the    City       Centre        and     Nottinghamshire                 to    the    M ad s ley B r i d g e        Station

in    the    North       of     Sheffield.             Such       action          would    defeat       the       segregation

plans       in    that     supporters            would       be    crossing          each       other       and    I    indicated

that       this    M,«ould n o t         be   acceptable           and       asked       the    British          Rail    to

reconsider           the      matter.           The    reasons          for       their    request          were       based    upon

management           difficulties               in    routing          and    time       scheduling          trains,           It    was

further          agreed       at     that     meeting        that       the       Operations          and    Traffic

Division          would       take       responsibilities                   for    all    traffic       matters

affecting          the     City       and     that     ’D ’ D i v i s i o n ,       the    Central          Division,          would

be    responsible             for     policing         their       own area          leaving          the    match       itself

to    be    the     responsibility               of    the       Divisional          Commander          of       the    Sheffield

North       Division,              The    meeting          closed       at    11am       (1100)       and    I took       no

further          part    in     the      planning          meetings          concerning          this       matter*

Following          upon       the     meetings         I spoke          to    Superintendent                MURRAY       and

Inspector          SEWELL          concerning          the       manpower          levels       used    at       the

previous          y e a r s ’s e v e n t      and     asked       them       to    examine       the    position

for    this       year     to      determine          if    any    reductions             or    increases          were

appropriate,             taking          into    account          our       findings       the    previous             year,        The
findings          the       previous          year       indicated          that        same       officers

were    under          employed          and       I was       conscious           of    the       need       not       to    repeat          such

a    situation             if    that    MJas      the    case       and    if     there       wsrs          no    other          factor

which       might          dictate       their        need      for       this     future          match*              The    only       other

action       I took             concerning          this       matter       was     to    maintain                liaison

with    Mr       McKRELL          during        the      next       feui d a y s    and       in    particular                to    make

reference             to    the       need    for     clear         indications           of       tickets             by    colour

coding       and       appropriate              colour         coded       systems        on       turnstiles                to    ensure

easily       recognisable                access          to    the       staidum,

In    the    knowledge                that    Mr    DUCKENFIELD             would        be    c o m m a n d i n g this event,

I personally                selected          the     Sector         Commanders           who       would          be w o r k i n g       to

him    and       as    in       the    previous          year       utilised        the       system          of       using       three

sectors,          those          being       the    Ground,          the    Liverpool              supporters                outside          the

ground       the       Nottingham             supporters             outside        the       ground*              In t h i s

connection             I selected             Superintendent                GREENWOOD              as    the       Ground

Controller,                Superintendent                MARSHALL           to     be    responsible                   for    the

Liverpool             supporters             and    Superintendent                 CHAPMAN          to       be    responsible                for

the    Nottingham                supporters.              All       three       officers           had       a M^ide         experience

in    policing             football          matches          and    in    fact     had       been       Sector             Commanders          at

the    Semi       final          the    previous          year.           The    only     difference                   was    that       Mr

MARSHALL          and       Mr    GREENWOOD           reversed            roles     and       this       was       because

Mr    MARSHALL,             having       been       my    Deputy          for    some     time,          had       a    better

knowledge             of    the       visiting        supporters            end     of    the       ground,             ie L e p p i n g s

Ln,    than       Mr       Greenwood,           who      had    been       away     from       the       Division             for     some

time    all       be       it    for    many       years       he    had    policed           matches             at    Hillsborough,

In a d d i t i o n ,        Sueprintendent                MURRAY          was    identified              as       the       Officer       in

charge       of       the       ground       control          communications              and       this          Officer          was    in

fact    the       man       who       regularly          took       up    that     position             at    First          Division

matches          throughout             the     season.

Prior       to    my       departure          from       ’F"    Division           I met       M^ith C h i e f

Superintendent                DUCKENFIELD             and       discussed             g/ith h i m           in    general          the

problems       on       Division.              During          that       discussion           the          semi       final       was

touched       upon       and       I appraised             him       of    the       staff     selected                and    the       fact

that    Mr    MURRAY          was       examining          the       manpower          situation.

On    the    day    of    the       semi       final,          Saturday          15 A p r i l       1989          (150489),             I had

no    role    to    play       in       the    operation             and       was    policing              my    own       Division             at

Barnsley*

At    approxiamtely                3«30pm          (1530)       that       day       I was     en       route          on    the       Ml

motorway       from       Barnsley             to    Sheffield             when,       on     local          radio,          I heard             of

difficulties             at    Sheffield             Wednesday             Football           Ground.                 The    reporter             did

not    seem    unduly          concerned             and       spoke       of    a    delay        in       the       match       due       to    a

pitch       invasion.              As    my    journey          progressed,              it    became             clear       from          the

radio       reports       that          the    incident          was       more       serious           and       there       was       some

indication          of    possible             fatalities.                 Calls       were        being          made       for       doctors

to    attend       at    the       Stadium          and    a    short          time    later        I heard             an

appeal       for    Police          Officers          to       respond          to    Hammerton              Rd       Police       Station.

It    was    approximately                   4pm    (1600)       at       this       time     and       I    immediately

responded          to    Hammerton             Rd    Police          Station,          arriving              at       approximately                   4.

20pm    (1640)*

On    arrival,          I saw       numerous          uniformed                Police        Officers             in    the       Station

area,       including          chief          Inspector          McROBBIE*               I    immediately                   went       to    the

Control       Room       and       contacted          Chief          Superintendent                 DUCKENFIELD                   in    the

Police       Control          Room       at    Sheffield             Wednesday          Football                 Club       via    the

internal       telephone                system.           I asked          Mr    DUCKENFIELD                 if       I could          be    of

any    assistance             to    him       and    he    asked          if    I could        deploy             uniformed

Officers       into       the       Leppings          Ln       area       on    foot     and       in a n         effort          to    calm

supporters          leaving             the    ground          and    show       compassion                 for       their       apparent

feelings       of       distress.

I    immediately          went          to    the    Canteen          at       Hammerton           Rd       Police          Station          with

Chief       Inspector          McROBBIE             and    organised             units        of    men          in    serials          under
                                                                                                                                  PAGE              S


the    command           of       Sergeants          and    briefed          them    as    to    the    information                   in m y

possession              concerning             the    current          situation.           I then          deployed             Units         to

locations           in       and       around    Sheffield             Wednesday          Football          Ground       and          Chief

Inspector           McROBBIE             dealt       with    the       notation       of    deployment.                  At       this

time       also     present             was    Superintendent                MORDEW       and    after       deployment                I

obtained           transport             and    together          with       Superintendent             MORDEW

attended           at    Sheffield             Wednesday          Football          Ground,       approaching                from

Middlewood              Rd    into       Leppings          Ln.     On       reaching       Parkside          Rd    I saw          that

Leppings           Ln    was       heavily       congested             by    football       supporters             and       a    large

number       of     fire          engines.           I alighted             from    the    car    and       began       on       foot

towards          the     stadium          and    there       met       Chief       Inspector          WARING*           The       crowd

was    dense        and       I would          generally          describe          the    attitude          of    supporters                  as

hostile          towards           the    Police*

I spoke          briefly           to    Chief       Inspector          WARING       and    he    confirmed             that          he   had

little       or     no       difficulty          at       that    location          and    the    crowds          were       gradully

dispersing.

Together           with       Superintendent                MORDEW,          I then       turned       into       the    private

road       leading           to    the    back       of    the    South       Stand       and    on    entering          that          area

through          the     gates          I saM> a n        area    of    sheeted       rails       adjacents             to       the

riverside           and       noted       a    number       of    bodies       laid       out    in    that       location*                I

was    approached                 by    Detective          Inspector          WEBSTER       who       informed          me       in    fact

that       there        were       eleven       bodies       at    that       location          and    he    further             informed

me    that       there        M^ere a         further       74    in    the    Gymnasium.

Prior       to     this       point       the    magnitude             of    the    situation          had    not       been          known

to    me    and     I    immediately             made       my    way       through       "C’ Gate          into    the          West

stand       enclosure              and    into       the    Police          Control       Room    where,          on arrival,                  I

found       Assistant              Chief       Constable          (Operations)             Mr    JACKSON,          Chief

the Le pp i n g s Ln end,          Press     in the Press Box and officials                     on the

playing area.

I noted that me ss ag es were being                    received on the           radio and were being

dealt wi th by the Control Se rg e a nt and PC and                          in general        they relat ed

to ou tbreaks of disorder and sporadi c fighting                              in and aro un d the

M AR S H A L L and S up er i n t e n d e n t MURRAY,       who both see me d to be extr em el y

distressed.             ACC Mr J AC K S O N was at te m p t i n g      to speak to Chief

point a te lephone             call was     re ce iv ed and was a n s w e r e d by Mr J A C K S O N .

F r o m the nature of the             conversation,          I form ed the opini on that                it was

a call      from the Chief Constable.                   Mr JA C K S O N was attem pt ing to ask

ques tio ns of Mr D U C K E N F I E L D and Mr M A R S H A L L and related them down the

taking      place throug h the m es sa ge s and noted that the main

com mun ica tio ns         handset was      not    being utilised,            but that       personal

Terraces»      Mr J AC KSO N and Mr DU CK E N F I E L D and Mr M A R S H A L L then left the

Commanders     in the form of S u p e r i n t e n d e n t C H A P M A N at the N o t t i n g h a m

side of the stadiu m an d Chief            Inspector W A R I N G at the Lep pin gs Ln area

of the Stadium.          It was   clear that there was some disorder and no

doubt as a consequence of the a t t i t u d e of su pporters and                        I instructed

that all     personnel      remain on duty and that the mobi le                   units,       named

Tango Units,         remain ready a n d available.

R e s po ns es were given to numerous            incidents of fighting,                but    in the

fullness    of time calm was         restored.

I recall    that trains had left the area,                    as had coaches whi ch were

released from their          coach parks       a n d w h i 1st I have no real           re co ll ec ti on

of t i m e , I r e c a l 1 that wh e n the     si t u a t i o n was   calm I made my way                to

the Gymnasium,         leaving Se rg ea nt     GO D D A R D   in the Control R o o m a n d there

ex amined the t e m po ra ry M o r t u a r y   f a c i 1 ities a c c o m m od ati ng   some 85

bodies.     There was some natural             confus ion, but        in general        things          were

in order and Det ec ti ve Chief su pe ri n t e n de nt A DD IS was                controlling            the

Mortuary as p e c t .     I spoke to a number of Of fi ce rs who were                        clearly in

shock an d were d is tr es se d by event w hi ch they had experienced.                              I

noted that     the temp or ar y M o r t u a r y was      located      in the Gymnasium,             whi ch

was s e p ar at ed    into three s e c t i o n s , the first s e ct io n containing                 the

b o d i e s , the second section be ing a relat ive sterile ar e a where Po l i c e

Offi cers were a c c o m m o d a t e d and the thi rd s e ct io n had been set up for

ident ificat ion purposes and statement                  taking by CID Of fi ce rs             .    A

sep ar at e s e ct io n had been created for              identifi cation purposes and this

was ad jacent        to a separate office where               relatives    could view bodies                     in

relative     privacey.

I formed the opini on that ar ra ng e m e n t s were well                 o r g an is ed and that

temp or ar y M o r t u a r y f a c i 1 it ies were well       in hand.     Dur ing this time                 I

way d is tr es se d by the e v e n t s .

Fo l l o w i n g   the visit to the Gymnasium,                 I checked the       remainder of the

St ad i u m a nd made my way to the D i re ct ors a r e a of the Sh e f f ie ld

W e d n e s d a y Cl ub situate       in the un derside of the S o u t h Stand,                  and there

saw G r a h a m M c K R E L L the Cl u b Secretary.              Some members         of the staff were

clearly di st r e s s ed and          I a d vis ed Mr M c KRE LL       regarding       c o u n s e l 1 ing

f a c i 1 ities     for junior membe rs and the need to ensure that medical

f a c i 1 ities were a v a i l a b l e .

Duri ng      these    conversations Mr M c KR E L L            informed me that he had                detaiIs

of the       computer     print-outs         regarding tu rnstiles          figures at 3 p m           (1500)

and that he had seized them and placed them                            in his safe        ( d r a w e r ).

Having      sati sfi ed myself that                things were     in order     in the Stadium,              I

resumed duty the Control                 Box and then sought se cu r i t y of the terrace

subject       of the disaster.

T h r o u g h S up er i nt en d en t M O R D E W    I ar ra ng ed for Of fi c e r s    to be dep loyed

to sec ur ity of the central                 pens wit h the        intent ion of       1) preserving

evidence and 2)           recovering         pr op ert y subject of those who had been

injured or who were deceased.

I noted that numerous Offi cers were assem bl in g                         in the No rth Sta nd

ready for debrief and because                       of their general       cond it io n a u t h o r i s e d

S u p e ri nt en de nt M O R D E W and S u pe ri n t e n d e n t BR OO KFIELD,        who had also

Ser ge an ts       could confi rm that a l 1 thei r Off ic er s were ac co unt ed for and

to note their wh er eab out s              dur ing the events.           In addit ion,         some

Offi cers who had res ponded to O p e r a t i o n Su ppo rt were                      in the     locality

and having          consulted wit h        'D* Division,         the Central D iv is io n of the

Once debrief            facilities          had been dealt with,            I instructed

Sup eri nt en d en t MO RD EW to stand down those Of fi c e r s who were                             no longer

requi red.

Havin g yet a ga in as se s se d the situat ion in the vi cinity of the ground,

I instructed that Tango U n i t s , the mobile units on public order

duties,         shoud    remain on patrol              and also      liaise wi t h Inspector HAND-

DAVIS,       the Mo u n t e d    Inspector,           that    his Of fi ce rs   should      remain on

patrol       in pairs       in an ar o u n d the Ground.

I was       informed that          relat ive were            in the vi cinity of the Gr ou n d wi t h a

view to i d e n ti fi ca ti on and was a d v i s e d that a c c o m m o d a t i o n and planning

had been put            into being for             ident ifi cation of the deceased*

Hav i n g    e x p e ri en ce d the stress            placed upon Of fi ce rs and families                 in and

aro u n d the temp or ar y Mortuary,                   I was      conscious of the co ns iderable

stress       placed upon Offi cers and a r r a n g e d for the Force Welfare

Offi c e r ,                                        to be called out for           c o u n s e l 1 ing   reasons.

I was       conscious of the fact that Social W or ke rs and membe rs of the

Chu r c h and S a l v a t i o n A r m y had been requested to at te n d at the scene to

ass is t with the           c o u n s e l 1 ing of relat i v e s .

I was       of the opini on that                 there wo ul d be some       co ns iderable delay in

the    identifi cation              of bodies and            in      the    re tention on duty of Offi ce

who were a l l o c a t e d          to each body for                 identifi cat ion p u r p o s e s .     In view

of this,         I caused feeding a r r a n g e m e n t s           to be put     in hand for those

Offi cers who were to be retained,                           pending    ident ifi cat ion of         individual

dec e a s e d    persons.

My    re col lec tio n    is that at a p p r o x i m a t e l y        1 0 -30pm    (2230)    the Min ister

Two weeks        prior to this date              I w o r k e d as a S t e w a r d at the club at

w h i c h time    I was g iven a sheet of              paper giving me              the time I was          to

start work on 15 April               1989    (150489).

At   11.3 0 am    <1130)    on S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989   <150489)        I a t t e n d e d at the

ground,     s ig ne d   in in the office a nd went up to m y post w he re                            I met

          who was al re ad y there.

I was w ea r i n g my y e l l o w w a i s t c o a t    toge th er w i t h my         iden ti ty     card.

In the process          of my empl oy me nt we have d i re c t i v e s               from the club that

u nless there       is an emergency,              no gate s h ou l d be o p en ed until about

t we nt y mi nu te s    before the end of the game.

F r o m my gate     I could see two P olice O f f i c e r s on the turnstiles,                          but

o utside the ground,           not    inside.       I could see that               they were s e ar ch in g

fans and taking flags and                cans of beer            from fans before            they    could get

into the ground.

D u ri ng the time b et w e e n       11.3 0 am      <1130)      and 2 . 5 8 p m    <1458)    I could       see

lots of fans wa lk in g          past    the turns ti le s          carr yi ng      four   packs of beer

cans and d rinking from cans.                    I could also see w ha t a p p e a r e d to be

ticket    touts     outside the ground,               close to M o n t y ’s Motors,            I c ould see

that t ickets were          changing hands.

T here was a s te ad y flow of fans                 t hr o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s , a l t h o u g h it

was quite slow u n t i 1 about 2 . 2 0 p m             <1420).

At this     time    it b egan to get busier outside a n d there was q ue u ei n g at

the t u r n s t i l e s . I was not      c o n t i n ua ll y    looking at the t u r n s t i l e s , just

looking over at          regular      intervals        or      if I h ea rd some thing u n u su a l. A t

about 2 . 2 0 p m   <1420)     I h eard one of tur n st i le              o p e r a to r s s h o u t , "Eh,

stop him he h a s n ’t got a ticket."

I looked across and saw a y o u t h who                     I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e , j u mp in g over        the

t u r n s t i l e . He then ran into the ground.

I t hen saw a s econd y o u t h w e a r i n g a leather j a c k e t ,                   purple      in colour

a n d a g r ee n jumper      running from one of the turnst i l e s . He was                          shout ing
                                                                                                          PAGE           4


"Liverpool,         L i v e r p o o o l ." He was       running a r o u n d shouting,           "Liverpool,

w e ’re the f uck ing          c hamp ion s. "

The Pol ice saw him a n d about                   five to ten m in u te s           later    I saw two

P o l i c e O f f i c e r s t hr o wi ng him out of the End Gate                    in P e n i s t o n e Rd.      A

short     t ime later        I saw the same y o u t h again.                He was       back   ins ide the

g ro u nd and still          chanting.        W i t h i n a few m o me n t s      the Poli ce Offi cers

who were       in he g r ou n d t h r ew him out again.

W h i 1st w a t c h i n g   the t u rn s t i l e s     I saw several        inci de nt s of fans           coming

to the operat ive on the gate a n d o ff e ri n g them a m ou n t s                          of cash to let

t he m in.     I could see           10 notes on the              counter.       I did not see a nyone

let    in for     paqyment        but there w er e several                offers m a d e . This       is not a

correct      procedure,         as this p a rt ic ul ar m a t c h was an all                 ticket       game.

Up until 2 . 5 8 p m        (14-58), w h i c h was w h e n           I left the g a t e , I c ould see

large n u mb er s of fans w a lk i n g                past the t u rn s t i l e s to w al k towa rd s

the o pp o si t e end of the ground.                    T he re were w e ar i n g L i v e r po o l

colours and         chanting slogans,- m a n y were still                       d r in ki ng and   carrying

cans of beer.           I w i t n e s s e d a number of L i v e r p o o l         fans    coming     into the

S p i o n H op stand.        I know that they were L i v e rp o ol                  fans as several

came up to me a nd a s k e d             if they c ould go from the s ta nd in g a r e a                       into

the seats,        as the fans          in m y s ta nd were from N o t ti n gh a m.              I told them

that    they c ould not move              b e tw e e n a r e a s .

O ne fan came to me several                   t imes      c o mp la in in g that he was being abused,

because      he s u p p o r t e d L i v e r p o o l    a n d s h o u l d n ’t have been      in that       s ec t io n

of the ground.

At a bo ut 2 . 5 8 p m      <1458)     I left the gate as                I was going to w a t c h the

first half of the f o o t b a l 1 g a m e , but                 I first w a n t e d to get a h am b ur g er

to eat.

I w a l k e d a lo ng the        p a s sa g ew a y b e ne a t h the s ta nd s       into the a re a b e ne a t h

the N Stand,          w here the nearest               h am b ur g er   stall    is situated.        As    I

re ached      it I saw a bout          100 fans s u p p or t in g L iv er p oo l          running a lo ng the
                                                                                                   PAGE         5


p as s a g e w ay and     into the C a n t i l e v e r Stand.

I can only assume that an exit gate had been o p en e d at the L e p p i n g s Ln

end of this          s tand because of the a mo un t          of people on mass.            I then

w a l k e d up onto the side of            pitch b e tw e e n the M S t a n d and the

S p i o n K o p . T his    is the    p osition w h e re a number        of P o li c e O f f i c er s

stand.     I M/as s hown a m a p of the g r ou n d by PC                               a nd have

m a r k e d onto     it the    p osition     I was stood,       w i t h a number 2 (Marked i

(Exhibit N um be r             )„

At about 3 . 0 6 p m       (1506)    same day I was w a lk i n g to the a bove             position,        I

could see that            the game had s ta r t e d a nd o b v i o u s l y   I had h ea rd the

c hanting of the s u p p o r t e r s . I saw a P ol ic e Offi cer on the                 pitch

talking         to the referee.       A few sec onds       later the R e f e r e e blew his

w h i s t l e and    indi cated to the        p l a y e r s , by poin ti ng his hand towards              the

players         t u n n e l , for t hem to leave the       pitch.

I looked t owards the W S t a n d and              could see that there were fans on the

pitch.     I could see a number of fans                 clim bi ng the f en cing a n d        it

a p p e a r e d that P ol ic e Offi cers w er e tryi ng to get t he m to go back onto

the s tanding         t erracing of the W Stand.            I b e l i e v e d that   the P o l i c e were

going to open the gate set                 into the f en ci ng and m ov e fans from the

centre a r e a b ehind the goal m o u t h to e it he r side,                 w he re there was more

space.

I was a p p r o a c h e d by a m e m b e r   of the St John* s A m b u l a n c e , who told me

that    there were a number of s e r i o u s l y inju re d people                in the W S t a nd

and w a n t e d to know how to get the A mb u l a n c e t h r o u g h onto the                pitc h. Th e

only w ay to get the A m b u l a n c e         in was to knock d ow n the a d v e r t i s i n g

h ar di n g s    in front of w h er e      I was s t a n d i n g . T o g e t he r w i t h several      other

Ste wa rd s      I k no c k e d down the h oardings a nd the A m b u l a n c e was d r i v e n            in.

The St J o h n ’s A ss i s t a n t a sk ed me to go to the W S t a n d and a ssist them.

This    I did.

As   I ran to the W S t a n d end of the ground                  I could see that the fans                 in
                                                                                                        PAGE          6


pens 3 a n d 4 of W S t a n d were               p ac ke d s olid w i t h fans at the front of

these       pens being       pushed t ig h t l y a ga in st          the fence.

T here was about            150-200 fans a l r e a d y on            the    pitch,    m i ll i n g around,   and

I could see           that fans w ere         being     lifted       up f ro m the s ta n di n g a re a      onto

the    ledge of the seating a r e a above,                      by   fans    in that area*

I could also see that a small                      piece of f e nc in g had been pulled back

but the gap           in it was      not very big*

I could see a number                of bodies        lay on          the ground,      some were being

t re a t e d by fans a nd P o l i c e Officers*

I could see a number                of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s   being    p ushed w h il s t they were

trying to give             r e s u s c i t a t i o n to fans on the floor,            fans who were

w a l k i n g a ro u n d w ere also s p i t ti ng at the P o li c e O fficers*

As    I got    closer       I could see that m a n y of the                  people    lay on the g r ou n d

were    o bv i o u s l y dead*

The first thing             I did was to         look at the bodies             to see      if any were

breathing,       most       I saw    were     blue f ace d a nd         I k ne w they were dead or the

o thers w ere being treated,

I was a p p r o a c h e d by a P o l i c e O ff i c e r who a s k ed me to help him w i t h the

body of a young             lad.    I w o u l d d e s c ri be        him as a bout 5 ’4 tall, 14/16yrs

old,    w ea r i n g d enim jeans that w ere               n earl y     white,- baseball          shoes and I

believe a red coat*                His   face was       c overed by a coat or something*

I picked the boy up by his                    legs w i t h the P o li c e O f fi c e r at his

shoulders a n d put him onto an a d v e r t i s i n g                  h oarding*      T h e n t o ge th er w i t h

several       other       people    c arried him to a space at the                    rear of the

D i s a b l e d toilet      in the N S t a n d      next to a n a mb ulance,            w he re we    laid him

on the floor.

A no th er    body was: brought           in after that and                laid beside the boy I had

h el pe d    ca.rry   *

I then r eturned to near to P e n 3, w here                          I a s s i s t e d several    f ir e me n to

c arry a n o t h e r      boy whose face was            covered up away*             This   time we took

the body to the seats              in the S S t a n d a n d passed him over to several

F i remen,      one of w h i c h I know as      ______________

I r eturned to close by the goa lp o st as                 I did    I saw a y oung girl

w e a r i n g a pair of w hite t r o u se rs w i t h pink        in them,     and a red s il ky

style jacket*         Her trousers      were                                               a nd her

top w as       rolled up revealing her stomach.                I could see that there were

large bruises         on her   stomach,       and    I then n ot i ce d that        her arms were

t wi s t e d   in funny ways and they a p p e a r e d to me to be broken. Her face

was a lso       c overed up.

A bout    five to six feet a way          I saw a no th er     body,    this time a y o u ng m an

a bout    twenty,     he had a moustache,            his eyes were half open a n d I could

see tears f or me d on the side of his eyes.

He was w ea r i n g a navy blue jumper w h i c h was               rolled up a n d was hold in g

his arms        up a gainst his      chest.

A short di st an ce from him was the body of a m a n a bout 60 yrs old. He

had a m o u s t a c h e a nd was w ea r i n g a light       c o lo ur ed jumper.       A g a i n he was

o b v i o u s l y dead.   I saw a picture of this m an             in the D a il y Mirror

n ewspaper       several    days    later,    only    in the   picture he was alive.            T he re

w as s omeone       lying above him who a p p e a r e d to be t r yi ng to bring him

back to life.

I then saw a girl           lay on the ground,          she was w e a r i n g a w h i te    *t * shirt

a n d was      being t re at ed by a m a n who said he was a n o f f - d u t y P o li c e

Officer.        He told me this w h e n       I told him that he d i d n ’t have her              head

back far enough.           T here was a m a n s tood close by who then said,                   "I hope

y o u know what y o u ’re doing,         t h a t ’s my daughter.        V i c k y come on."

I then h eard fans from the             crowd shouting,         "Come on,      get her tits out

for the boys."

A St J ohn's A m b u l a n c e man then        came up and the P o l i c e m a n a sk ed him for

some oxygen.         He d i d n ’t have a n y so the P o l i c e m a n a s k e d the same of a

Fireman        close by,    he h anded over a cylinder,             w h i c h was    f ou nd to be
                                                                                                        PAGE         8


empty.     The F i r e m a n then said,            "What    do y o u e x p e c t , I ’ve a l r e a d y used

it on at       least six         people,      it only      lasts about        t w en t y m i n u t e s ."An

A m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d a nd e ve ry t h i n g   became a bit        chaotic but        I saw

this girl        being     put      into the A m b u l a n c e .

Wh ilst     this was       going on there were a large a mo un t                    of fans w al k in g

round sho ut in g abuse at the P o l i c e and s p i t t in g at them.

I then saw two m ore                bodies,    these were men,            both of large b uild w h o *s

f aces were       b l u e . T h ey had both v o mi t e d and this was                 covering their

faces,      from this        I b e l i e v e d they had been dr i n ki ng .A couple of girls

f r o m the    clubs office           came out onto the            pitch     with B

jugs of w ater a nd           I remember         h aving a d rink of          it,    then going to            the

centre of the           pitch and t al ki ng to some other S t e w a r d s . I at this time

had had enough.            I was      feeling      ill,    I had a h ea d ac h e a n d       I was     in

s o me w h a t of a d a z e „

I cannot       remember m u c h more about                it, as      I was s o m e w ha t   in shock and

was   s w e a t i n g . W h i 1st    I was    h elping move        the bodies       I had a number of

fans s ho u ti ng and sw ea ri ng at me saying,                       "You f u ck i ng S te w ar d s    caused

t h i s ," a n d "you s hould have g i ve n us the other e n d . "

I also saw several               fans f i g h t i n g on the       pitch-     I left the grou nd at

5 . 3 0 pm (1730) at whi ch t ime the L i v e r p o o l                fans were      still     leaving but

t here was n o th in g more that               I could d o .

I would       like to make           the o b s e r v a t i o n that    I saw P o l i c e O f fi ce rs

p u l 1 ing people out of the                crowd and were           pushing t he m to one s i d e ,

b efore     checking       if they could be ass isted f ur ther medi cally.

I also saw during the                 problems a fter the game               a 1 ine of P ol ic e

O f f i ce r s w er e used to cordon off the                 pitch.       I feel     that they s h ou l d

have been used to a ssist the                    i nj ur ed and dying*          I also beli ev e that

there M/ere fewer P ol ic e              inside the ground.

I cannot u n d e r s t a n d w hy the gate               in L e p p i ng s Ln was opened beca us e              it

is obvious        that     fans who are fanati cal a bout                  football will         run t ow ards
                                                                                                              PAGE


              the nearest        e ntrance     to get to the terraces,            e s p e c i a l l y w h e n the game

              has s ta r t e d and this        is w hat t he y appear       to have d o n e .

              I w o u l d also     like to say that         I h ea rd a number of fans            from L i v e r p o o l ,

              a bout 20,      said to me and w ere s ho wi n g off to cameras from BBC

              Tele vi sio n,     saying      that they had got        into the g r ou n d either w i th ou t

              t ic k e t s or on f orged ones.

              Whilst      every a s s is ta nc e was being g iv en by a n umber              of people,       I saw

              p ho to gr ap he rs a n d press m e n taking          pho to gr ap hs   of the d ea d bodies

              i nstead of helping t h e m s e l v e s . T he re were also a number                 of fans going

              around      pushing    people who were a s s i s t i n g      the   injured.

              I was ear 1 ier s hown a m ap of the g r ou nd on whi ch I m a r k e d my posi ti on

              in the g r o u n d at the start          of m y tour of duty.           This   is   (marked

I noted that me ssages were                     being    received on the          radio and were being

dealt with by the Control Se rg ea nt an d PC and                            in general        they related

to ou tbreaks of disorder and sporadi c fighti ng                              in and around the

Fr o m the nature of the conversation,                           I formed the opini on that              it was

a call from the Chief C o n s t a b l e .                 Mr J A C K S O N was at te m p t i n g to ask

taking     place throu gh the me ss age s a n d noted that                        the ma i n

of the Stadium.           It was     clear that there was some disorder and no

doubt as a consequence of the at ti t u de of supporters a nd                          I instructed

that all      personnel      remain on duty and that the mob il e u n i t s , named

Tango Units,        remain ready a n d a v a i l a b l e .

Re s po ns es were given to numerous                incidents     of fighting,        but    in the

fullness      of time     calm was      restored.

I r e c a l 1 that trains had          left the area,         as had     coaches w h i c h were

of time,      I r e c a l 1 that w h e n the       s i t ua ti on was   calm I made my way              to

in order and De tective Chief su pe ri n te nd en t AD DI S was                    controlling           the

M o r t u a r y aspect.     I spoke to a number of Off ice rs                who were       clearly in

shock and were d is tr ess ed by event wh ic h they had experienced .                               I

noted that       the te mp ora ry Mo r t u a r y was       located      in the Gymnas ium,          wh ic h

was se pa ra te d     into three sections,            the first s e ct io n containing the

se parate se cti on had been created for                   ide nti fi ca ti on   purposes and this

was adj ace nt      to a separate office where                relatives      could view bodies                   in

relative      privacey.

I formed the opinio n that ar ra nge men ts were well                      organ ise d and that

f a c i 1 ities    for junior members a n d the need to ensure                        that medical

f a ci li ti es were available.

During these           co nv ersations Mr M c K R E L L          informed me that he had               detaiIs

of the computer              print-outs         regarding       turnstiles    figures at 3pm           (1500)

and that he had seized them and placed them in his safe                                    (d r a w e r ).

Having sa t i s f i e d myself             that        things were    in order    in the Stadium,            I

Once debrief          facilities          had been dealt with-,           I in structed

S up er i n t e n d e n t M O R D E W to stand down those Of fi c e r s who were no longer

required.

Ha v i n g yet ag ai n as ses s ed the s i tu at ion               in the vi cinity of the ground,

I instru cte d that Tango Units,                     the mobile      units      on public order

DAVIS,     the M o u n t e d     I n s p e c t o r , that his Officers          sho ul d remain on

patrol     in pairs        in an aro un d the Ground,

I was     informed that           relative were           in the vi ci nit y of the G r ou n d wit h a

view to i d e n ti fic at ion and was a d vi se d that a c c o m m o d a t i o n and planning

had been put          into being for             ide nt if ic at io n of the deceased.

Havi ng    ex p e r i e n c e d the stress          placed upon Of fi c e r s and families             in and

a r o u n d the temp or ar y M o r t u a r y , I was          conscious      of the    conside rable

stress     placed upon Of fi c e r s and ar ra n g ed for the Force Welfar e

Officer,                                         to be called out for            counselling      reasons.

I was     conscious        of the fact that Social                Worke rs and membe rs         of the

Chu r c h a n d S a l v a t i o n Ar m y had been requ es te d to a t t e n d at the scene to

assist wi t h the          counselling           of relatives.

I was     of the opinion that                  there w o u l d be some     considerable        delay    in

the   id en ti f i c a t i o n     of bodies and          in the retention on duty of Of fi ce rs

who were a l l o c a t e d         to each body for i d e n ti fi ca ti on p u r p o s e s .      In   vie w


of this,         I caused feeding a r r a n g e m e n t s to be           put    in hand for those

Officers who were to be retained,                         pending     i d e n ti fi ca ti on of individual

My re col le ct io n    is that at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10.30pm      (2230)    the Mi nister

arrived,      a c c om pa ni ed by Chief S u p e r i n t e nd en t DUCKENFIELD.           Together

S h o r t l y after this,     an impromptu        press    conference took            place on the

was then taken to the G y m n a s i u m where he spoke to Of fi ce rs                     concerning

their    involvement       in the d a y ’s event.          He     later   left the scene.

Ar ra ng em en ts were made for the             reception of relatives for

ide nti fic ati on purposes a nd social workers an d members                          of the Chu rc h

were    briefed to expect          relatives atte ndi ng           in dis tr es se d situations.

These    rep res entatives were            readily av ai la bl e       throughout      the night an d

in fact met numerous            relatives and remained with them throughout                         the

ide nti fic ati on p r o c e d u r e s .

I remained        in the vi cinity of the G y m na si um throug hou t the night and

was    present     through many       identifications           of dec ea se d persons a n d noted

T hr ou gh ou t   these events       I noted that the Am bu lan ce Li ai so n Offi cer was

present     in the te mp ora ry M o r t u a r y and at one stage               I asked    if he could

increase the number of mobile stretc her s av ai lab le to speed up the

in this      connec ti on a n d         was    e x t re me ly profess ional         in his d u t i e s .      The

process of          identifi cation           continued until         a p p r o x i m a te ly 5am    (0500)»

when arr ang em en ts were made                for the remainder of the bodies                      to be

removed to the City M or t u a r y where the                   process wo ul d be continued

later     in the day.

During the        course of events during the evening,                        the Coroner,          Mr St e f a n

P O P P E R , a t t e n d e d the scene       together with Pr o f e s s o r Al a n USHER,             who

both viewed arrang eme nt s              and    confi rmed the        location of bodies at the

S h e f f i e l d City Mortuary.

At ap pr ox i m a t e l y 5 . 30 am     (0530)     I left the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l 1

I wish to       place on record my              considerable a p p r e c i at io n of the efforts

of all     individuals         involved        in this m a t t e r , a n d    in particular           the

               I am a single man residing at the above address,



              O n the af t e r n o o n of S a t u rd ay    15 April    1989    <150489)   I a t t e nd ed at the

              F A Cup Semi Final              football m a t c h between Li verpool and N o tt in gh am

               For e s t at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football Gr o u n d    in Sheffield.



              Early      in Ma y       1989   (000589)   I was    intervi ew ed by two officers        from the

               West Mi dl an ds Police and I co mpleted a q u e s t io nn ai re            in respect of

              Hi 11s b o r o u g h „



               As stated         in the questionnaire,           I entered the ground via a gate to the

               right     of the turnstiles at about               three o ’clock   (1500>»     I now know

               that      I entered via gate         "C5.    I did not have a m a t c h ticket          prior   to
                                                                                             PAGE


going to S h e f f i e l d as     I was hoping        to aquire      one on the day*        I was

not able to get a ma tc h ticket on the day,                       so I was ticketless at the

time of entering          the ground,,



Having    got      into the ground        I headed straight          for the    central    tunnel

that   runs un de r n e a t h the West Stand*              Only a few people       came    into the

grou nd at that time-             There was myself and my friend

and about         half a dozen other         lads*                            lives at

                                          H e ’s been seen by the Police.



We M.>ere able to walk along              the tunnel       quite freely,       until about       half

w a y down.        At this    point we     came up against a solid wall                of people who

were waiti ng        to go out       into the      pens*     We had to stop behind these

people and at the same time numerous                       other   people    came along the

tunnel    behind us,         which    packed us      in.     It took betwe en one and two

mi n u t e s to get to the end of the tunnel.                      It was very tightly packed

by then an d we had no choice but                   to go towards      the    left hand pen at

the end of the tunnel.                I w ou ld think that the time was shortly after

three o ’clock        (1500)    wh e n I e n te re d the      left hand pen,      which    I now

know to be         pen number     four.      The    players were on the         pitch and there

was a lot of noise from the ground,                    o b v io us ly in response to the game

on the     pitch.      I entered pen four wi t h                                   I remember

thinking      how crowded it was           in the     pen*     We went      forwards   down the

te rraces and m a na ge d to find a position about                    five yards       from the end

of the tunnel a n d sl ightly to the                 left of the goalposts*             I have

m a r k e d the    position on the separate            grid plan using the figure            one.

Robert    ms       still with me wh e n I took up position one*                   Wh e n we first

took   up that       position     it was     tight,    but not a crush.          It was    like any

normal L i v e r p o o l / E v e r t o n game*     I looked behind me at some stage and

up at the seating area above the terraces.                           I remember seeing two
                                                                                                 PAGE          3


P o l i c e m e n standing     at the     front    of the seats who were           looking out

towards the          pitch.     After a couple of m i nu te s          in position one,          I was

aware    of becoming          crushed by the cro'^d.            There were      still    people

entering       the    pen from the        rear and the      pressure     from the tunnel           area

was    increasing all          the time.         I now had no mov ement at all             being

c o mp le te ly    crushed in by the            crowd and I start ed having d if fic ult y

breathing.           I could not      see an yt hi ng of the ma tc h noM; as            I had my face

pressed up against the back of the                     person    in front of me.           I remember

people shouting up to the two Po l i c e m e n standing above us                         in the

seating area.           They were sho uting           for them to help as we were

being    crushed.           I ma na g e d to turn my head a r ou nd a nd         I shouted to

them to help us.              The two P o l i c e m e n just    carried on looking out

towards     the      pitch,    they d i d n ’t look down at us at all.              At about        the

same    time      I heard a lad shout that there was                  so mebody dead in the            pen.

I c o u l d n ’t believe that at the time thinking                    he must    have been

exagerating.           I was    crushed        in position one for between five and ten

minutes.          After about      five minutes        I felt myself      being mo ve d forwards

slowly.        The forwards mo vme nt was             caused by steady surges            from the

rear of the          pen,    caused by the amount         of people still          entering      the     pen

from behind.           The surges        carried us ste adi ly forwards            until    I felt a

slight    release       in the     pressure.         I dont know u,'hat caused          the sudden

release     in the      pressure,        but    I could move again       not much       but it

enabl ed me to get my breath back.                     By this    time   I was about        half way

down    pen four       in a position w hi ch          I have mar ke d on the separate              grid

plan using         the figure      1A.     I had become        se pa rat ed fram              by this

time,    but      I could still       see him about ten yards            in front of me,

further down the terraces.                     I d o n ’t know what    time   it was then,         but    I

was again able to see the                 pitch and the         players had     left the pitch.

At    position       1A I became aware of people                getting out of pen four via

the gate       in the front        perimeter       fence and by climbing over the front
                                                                                          PAGE         4


fence    itself.      As more      people     left the      pen more space was      created at

the front*        I made my way towards the front fence and as                      I did so I

saw a line       of bodies at the front             of the    pen up against      the wall.

There were       four to five bodies           lined up      next to each other and they

all ap p e a r e d dead.      I then saw some         lads on the       inside of the pen

pulling at       the wire mes h fencing. They                were pulling from the       inside

i^hile some      P o l i c e m e n were   kicking   at it    from the outside.       I helped

these    lads to pull        the mesh away.          We e ve ntu al ly broke the mesh wh ich

snapp ed at the bottom a n d              pulled   it towards    us.     I then climbed out

t h ro ug h the broken mesh,          wh ic h was the bottom left hand corner of the

pen^    as you    look from the stand.              I met up with                a ga in on the

track just outside the             pen.               had got out a couple of minutes

before me and had been waitin g                for me.       We then went    onto the    pitch

and sat down somewhere             betwe en the edge of the ei gh tee n yard box,               near

to the    "D" area outside           the e i g h t e e n yard box*     By noM; I would

estimate    the time to be som ewhere               between half       past three    (1530)    and

three    thirty five       (1535).        We sat there for about          five minutes    to

recover.      We then got up and w a l k e d towards             the No rt h Stand to see         if

M;e could help in an y M;ay.              There were Police a r o u n d there who were

saying get back onto the              pitch that there were enough people helping

there.     B e ca us e of this we wa l k e d over to the other              side of the       pitch,

towards    the So ut h St an d and sat on the               running track about      ha lfway

betwe en the centre          line and the Le ppings LN goal              line.    We had been

sittin g on the track for about                five minutes when we saw lads            ripping

down a d v e rt isi ng   hoardings        from the front       of the South Stand.        Myself

and              went down towards Le ppings LN end and                  I helped a lad to rip

a hoarding down.           Myself a n d the other           lad then carried the hoarding

towards    the Lepping s LN goal.                        came behind us.         We had seen

other hoardings on the grou nd near to the Le ppings LN goal                         to the     left

as you look from the Hop end of the ground.                      As we app ro ac he d the goal,
                                                                                                 PAGE          5


we   could see a ma n being           rolled onto anoth er            hoarding 4      He was     being

hel ped onto       it by a Po li c e w o m a n and other supporters*                 T he h o a r ding

rwas“““on the    pitch itself,        about    tM/o feet       in from the goal         line and just

 ins 1 de~~ t-he eighteen yard bos-t.          A s ^ S D o n as the m a n was on the hoarding

I could see that he"lias-'unconscious                  but     it Viever crossed by m i nd that

                         'dead.     I could only see half of the mans                    face,    but      I

remember       that he was     very     pale,       not blue, but very pale,            The m an was

 lying   on his     left hand side.           I picked up the           rear    left hand side of

the hoarding*                     was on the other           side,    carrying the       rear to

middle     section.      There was a P o l i c e w o m a n      carrying the s e ct io n in front

of me,        The P o l i c e w o m a n had a hat on and was wearing a dark tunic,

There were three or four others                 carrying        the hoarding as well*            We   ran

towards       the far    left hand corner of the ground.                      While we were      running

wi t h the hoarding one of the other                  lads was saying to the man               " I t ’s

alright,       y o u ’ll be al ri ght ,"      But    there was       no response from him,            no

m o ve me nt at all*     When M.ie got to the far              left hand corner of the ground

we M.'ent in between the N o r t h S t a n d a n d the S p i o n H op with the hoarding.

We went       round to the     left     hand side then, behind the N or th Stand,                     into

a concrete ar e a which was             covered.       There were other           bodies    lying in

that area.         There were      three maybe        four     bodies    on the     left hand side

and a similar amount           on the      right     hand side.         We    placed the hoarding

down     in the next av ailable space,               on the     left hand side.          We left the

hoarding an d the ma n there a n d we then all                    returned back towards

Le pp in gs    LN end.     I did not see a n yb od y else ap pr o a c h the hoarding                      in

On the aft er n oo n of Sa tu rd ay       15 April    1989   (150489)    I was wearing         the

folloi^ing clothes - a red round neck t shirt,                  short    sleeved with the

w ord s   "MARCO POLO"      on the front.       The   lettering    is thin and      large,      all

across    the    chest*     The   lettering    is in the     colours,    purple,    blue and

green.      I also wore a pair of faded denim jeans and a pair of training

shoes*     They are       black with blue flashes a n d the          letter   ’W    in white

on each side.



I am a white male wi t h          light   brown h a i r r centre   parted and shaved at

attendan t.        We did the usual            checks on the vehicle               itself and        its

equipment and then w ai t e d for                  calls.    On     S a t u r d a y we   were using the

n o n- em e r ge nc y    channel    for Sh e f f i e l d a n d Don ca ste r       on     vehicle       radio.

7. As far as            I can recall we were asked to do an a d m i s s i o n to St Luke,

a disc ha rg e from Ha l l am s hi re a nd King Edwards                    non-urgent work.              We

were    busy wi t h no n- e m e r g e n c y    calls until         about    1300 hours wh e n we

returned to station.                After     lunch we dropp ed off a discharge                     patient

from the Royal H a l la ms hi re             and then confirmed to control                  that we were

clear.       We were told to return to station.

8. At the ju nc ti on of L o n gl ey Ln and He rri es Dr we                        received a call

from control.             As far as        I can recall      the    call    came throu gh just after

1500 hours*             My a tt end an t    crew member a n s w e r e d the        call and the

m es sa ge   to us M>as - "To a t t e n d Leppin gs Ln entrance                     of H i l l s b o r o u g h

grou nd as some           people have been injured"                  or words to         that effect*

This was a red call              so we had to proceed               at     speed a n d put on the

lights and sirens.               As far as         I can recall       we were told there would be

Incident Of fi ce rs at the scene.                    I al re a d y knew that my station

officer w ou ld be           in the ground as duty officer.                    This was       routine

since the Br a d f o r d fire.

9.     I drove via Herrie s Dr,               Herri es Rd and         came down Le pp in gs L n r
                                                                                                 PAGE


turning         left   into the ground.           O n arrival at the ground entrance there

was a cordon of about              three deep Police Officers*                 I recall     there were

about      four m o u n t e d Office rs        in addition.

10.    I drove towards the Le pp i n g s Ln entrance                  to the ground where there

was a te m p o r a r y barrier acro ss            the entrance.        The   crowd a p p e a r e d

normal      for a S a t u r d a y match.         I informed the Police Of fi ce rs            that         I

had been told to a t t e n d a n d a s k e d them what               the   incident w a s . I did

not a c t u a l l y    receive any reply but the Of fi c e r s at the barrier moved

it enough for me to get the am b u l a n c e              into the ground.              I did not          see

any other a m b u l a n c e s there and presumed we were the first on site*

11.       As we enter ed the gro un d there did not appear                     to be an yt hi ng out

of the ordinary*               In the    immediate area       <see    plan area AG)        it was

fairly quiet a n d          it a p p e a r e d to me that most        people were a c t u a l l y

in the ground.            As    I recallf           got out of the         left side of

the vehicle an d was walking                   to the rear.      I got out of the vehicle and

a sk ed    people what was happening.                There was a girl          holding her           chest

and abdomen supp or te d by a young man.                     I a s s i s t e d her    into the

a m b ul an ce    and at that time         I noticed a sud de n wave of people

coming from the di r e c t i o n of the ground.                  I do not knoo; exact ly

where      they came from but they a p p e a r e d to come from the                     left side of

the vehicle            (point AG near West         stand).      I knoo; they did not         come from

the    rear of the vehicle              i*e*    the Le pp in gs Ln entrance*            I realised

that      there were a number of               casualties.     Some were being           carried and

some were being wal ke d by colleagues*

12.       The    casualties a p p e a r e d headed for open space.                   Some were       put

on the floor*            There was a large male           casualty who was             loaded into the

vehicle.          The m a n was    revived a n d he left of his own accord.                      I

realised at this time that there were far more s e r io us ly                            injured

than those a r o u n d us.

13.       As far as       I can recall         I radioed Control       on the domestic           channel
                                                                                                      PAGE         4


    and   I       a s k e d for a    least   three other          vehicles for this      location w hi ch

    a p p e a r e d to    be the      requirement at that t i m e .

    14.     I took the cots out of the               rear of the vehicle.               A number of

    people     including a u n i for med          police officer          brought a young male______

    casualty a n d placed him on one                co t.        I carried out a quick           check and

    he a p & e a r e d not to be breathing.                I grabb ed an ai r w a y from the vehicle

    and   inserted this a n d gave him a                 fe w    inflations w ith the bag and mask

    Mjhich revived him.              H e was    put on          the vehicle wi t h the     bag and mask

    and the       police officer as escort *                     The next thing       I recall was that       a

    small         child casualty of about           10 was brought out to me.               He app ear ed

    to be         w or th giving      treatment    to*      An off duty doctor a p p e a r e d a nd he

    dealt with a number               of casualties evaluat ing whether                 they were dead or

    wo rth treating*

    13.     The    child was        placed on the second cot and placed                   in the vehi cle
r

^and      I continued to work on him*                    I then a sk ed the         police where my

. attendant w a s .

    16.     She then a p pe ar ed and           I said we had to get to hospital                as    other

    vehicles w ou ld be wanting                to come          in.   She got      in the back and I

    drove.        I had di ffi cul ty        in moving the vehi cle at first because

    casualt ies had been              laid out    in the path of the vehicle *                  I drove

    round     past the So uth stand and headed straight for the No rt h e rn

    General       via Pen is to ne Rd as this was                the nearest       hospital *

    17-     We ar ri ve d at N o rt he rn General               casualty to off        load the two

    casualties*          We con tacted Control            by radio at N o r t h e r n General          to say

    we were       clear and         returning    to Hi 1 lsborough.

    18*     A Control       Office r told us to wait a nd                collect a medical           team from

    N o r t h e r n General    to take them to the Hi 1 lsborough.                     I went    straight     in

    to see a Charge Nurse a nd told him that                          I was   to   collect a medi cal

    team for Hi 1 lsborough.

    19.     There were        three doctor s and a medi cal               staf f available       straight

away*      The    casualty de partment was a l r e a d y busy at that              time*     The

medical        team needed an a n a e st he ti st      but he was not av ailable at that

moment*                        I     and I loaded the teams        equipment      into the

vehicle.         There was a short delay waiti ng for the an ae st h e t i s t and                    I

took     the o p p or tu ni ty to radio       control a n d tell     them our fleet         number

wh ich    is wr it te n on the vehicle.             This was so that we could be

id entified for equipment we were                  carrying     rather   than having to wait

in line.

20.      The ana est he ti st a rr i ve d and we        left to return to the ground.

Control        told us to head for the Pen is to ne Rd gym entrance*                     I drove

back to the ground down H e rri es Rd S ou th and up Penis ton e Rd.

21*      Am bul anc es   for       casualties were     lined up a n d    I saw S t a t i o n Officer

EA SO N who      I knew from Lo ng le y Station.            He dir ect ed me to the

gym entrance*

22.      The doctors who we            carried got out just        inside the gym entrance

to the ground*           T h e y made    their w a y onto the      pitch*      I left the

vehicle and followe d them               carrying the equipment          from the ambulance.

23.      I saw a fire officer on the               pitch a nd    left the box of equipment

on the      pitch nearby so that            I could return to my vehicle.              On the

pitch I saw a line of police                 officers across a n d        I could not see

beyond them.          At our side of the           line of police        (the Sp ion Kop)      there

were hundreds         of fans stood around*             I re turned to m y vehicle near the

Pen is t o n e Rd entrance.            I was a p p r o a c h e d by a number   of police

officers a nd a man            in a grey track       suit who     identi fie d himself as a

N o t t i n gh am sh ir e Am bu l a n c e m a n acting as a s t ew ar d for the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest     supporters*

24.      The    police said they w a nt ed an ambul anc e on the               pitch straight

away *     The man       in the grey track         suit said he w o u l d show me the way

onto the        pitch.    He sat       in the front,                        was   in the back and

I was driving an d drove onto the                  pitch.

25.    I had di ffi cu l ty       in driving       through the entrance a n d        caught       the

rubbing     strip on the side of the vehicle on the                     railing.     The nearside

mirro r was        pushed out of line*            I then drove onto the pitch*

We    parked a short way onto the                pitch by a casualty who was al re ad y on

a tr oll ey a nd had been          intubated.

26.    He was       picked up by people nearby and we off                 loaded one trolley

from the vehicle            to make    room for him a n d he was         loaded in with       a

doctor-      There were also           two people with him.            I then left the     pitch

via Pen is to ne Rd.          On leaving       I was     checked out   by an Ambul anc e

Officer who took details of call                   sign,    patient    numbers and

destination.          We    left the grou nd heading          for the No r t h e r n General*           At

this time traffic was a bit heavy wi t h su pp or te rs                   leaving.     On arrival

at N o r t h e r n General      we t r a ns fe rr ed him to a hospital       tr oll ey a nd the

doctor    stayed wi th him.            We    returned to the ground and gave a lift

back   to two people who had a c c o m p a n i e d the           cas ualty a nd also two other

people who had been             in the      casualty department at the hospital.

27.    We were       told by Control          to return to Pe n i s t o n e Rd a nd were

di re ct ed to the front of            the queue and told to keep to the left                 side

by St a t i o n Office r EASON.             Becau se   of an oncoming     vehicle    I en ded up

in the way of the other               vehicle     on the    road and was usher ed      into the

the ground.          I stayed wit h the vehi c l e .          I wai te d for 20 minutes

inside the Pe ni sto ne Rd entrance*                   I rec eived a messag e      from Control

aski ng my     location.         I told them my          location and that    I was w ithout

trolleys *         Th ey said    it was a request          from S i e r r a 403 asking my

1ocation.

28.    At this time          I was single        handed.     Control    relayed that to my

attendant,                            who was     now on vehicle 403.        I informed the

De p u t y Chief Am bulance Offic er H O PK I N S and D av id J ON ES requested all

31.    We took a further            break and then were told that there were about

twelve     bodies at the No r t h e r n General a n d one at the Royal

Hallamshire.          He sent four vehicles for the twelve and he                     instructed

After about 20 minutes              the body was          ready for    collection*    We   loaded

the body onto the vehicle and                  returned to the ground          informing Control

33.    On arrival        at the Pe ni sto ne Rd entrance we were               informed that the

34.    I was then informed by an Officer that there were two more

               1*      I was       born on

              2.       I am a Q u a l i f i e d A m b u l a n c e m a n and joined S YM AS           in February,         1975

                       (000275).           I received no am b u l a n c e         training     before that date.

                       My first year wi t h S Y M A S was a p r o ba ti on ar y period,                      and included

                       undertaking a two week basic training                         course      in Sheffield.

                       Thereafter,            I a t t e nd ed M a r k f ie ld for a six week          residential

                       course.         I became a Q u a l i f i e d A m b u l a n c e m a n after one y e a r ’s

                       service.            I have no paramedic training.

              3.       I am based at M a l t by Station,                 and was     on duty on S a t u rd ay           15th

                       April        1989    (150489).      I was ac tu a l l y on the day shift.                   I

                       spe ci f i c a l l y    recall   early on S a t u r d a y a f t e r n o o n receiving a

                       call        from Control      ask in g my driver*                                     and       I to

                       stand by on a house              fire on B a l b y Rd        in D o n c a s t e r .   I would
                                                                                     PAGE         2


say that the time was             betwe en   1430 a n d 1450.          Control    then

informed us that we were no longer                  required in relation to this

house fire,      an d were    re quested to return to Ma l t b y Station.

11    was about    1510 w h e n we were a p p r oa ch in g M a 11by Station,

at w hi ch point       in t ime    I te le ph on ed Control       to    inform them that

we had returned to b a s e .           We were    immedia te ly requested to

proceed dir ec tl y to S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football       ground,    a nd that

an incident had taken place w h i c h had caused a large number                              of

injuries.       We tr av ell ed to the football            grou nd      immediately

on emergency.

As we were ap p r oa c hi ng       the f o o t b a l 1 ground,    we were     informed

by Control      to make our way over to the g y m n a s i u m , at the

P e ni st one Rd end of the ground.              I di rected

on the quickest         route to the ground,           wh ic h was      via Baw tr y R d ,

B ri gh ts id e Ln,    up Well St and Herrie s Rd Sth.                  As our vehicle

was ap pr oa c hi ng    the ground along Herries Rd,               a large number

of support ers were mak in g           their way out of the ground up along

Herries Rd.       I could     clearly see that          large numbers         of the     crowd

looked very dazed and were              crying.

At the ju nction of Herri es Rd S th wit h Pe ni st on e R d ,                           1

            turned      left on to Penis ton e Rd,          tr av ell ed down

ap p r o x i m a t e l y fifty yards and then turned          180 degrees         back

up the other side of Herri es Rd,                a m a n oe uv re w h i c h was    carried

out under Police d i r e c t i o n s .       At the first        entrance     to the

ground,    whi ch is ma rk e d A on the at ta c h ed          plan,      our vehicle

was   brought    to a standstill.            At this    p o i n t , the volume of

traffic and specta to rs was far too heavy to enable us to

ma no euv re along Pe n i s to ne Rd.         I r e c a l 1 a Polic e Officer

informing me at this          point     in time that there were some

injured people behind the S o u t h Stand
                                                                                         PAGE


down alo ng the        per im et er     road inside the ground beh in d the

S o u t h Stand.     Whe n we     reach ed the Owl C l u b w h i c h is ma r k e d

B on the a t t a c h e d    plan,     we were st opped by a number of

fans who were        he lping     one    casualty.        This   casu al ty was ho lding

his   chest an d was        cle ar ly having d i f f i c u l t y     in breathing.,

I w ould say that the time was a p p r o x i m a t e l y             1535 hrs.

                     stop p e d the      vehicle an d       I im m e d i a t e l y got out

to help       the    casu al ty      into the    rear of the am bu lance.             I a sked

the   casualty if he w a n t e d to           lay down,     but he re plied that he

was able to sit up.             I put him on an oxygen mas k to help him

w i t h his br eathing.         I then got out of the veh ic le an d a

few yards awa y        I noti c e d a Police Of ficer            carrying out

cardiac mass a g e on a ca sualty on the floor,                      situa te at

point Con the a t t a c h e d plan.           The Pol ic e       Of ficer a s k e d me       if

we had a suct i o n unit as the               ca sualty     had s w allowed his own

vomit.      I took out the s u c t i o n unit from the am bulance

vehicle,     and    I a s p i r a t e d the   casua lt y w h i 1st

gave fu rther       cardiac massa ge .          This    casu al ty was brea th in g

very po orly       indeed a n d his       pulse was e x t r e m e l y w e a k .

As a large number           of people were mill i n g ar o u n d this

c a s u a l t y , I made   the d e c i s i o n to get the ca sualty          into

the a m b u l a n c e and a w a y to hospital          as qui ckly as      possible,

w h i 1st there was still a chance of saving his                       life*      I

took a cot out of the veh ic le wit h the help of some f a n s ,

he 1ped load the ca sualty on to the cot a n d then back                          into

the a m b u l a n c e where    the    cot was     se cured on its b r a c k e t s .

The Police Off i cer ass ist i ng then req u e s t e d a Poli ce m o t o r ­

cyclist to give us an escort                  to the N o r t h e r n General

that    four     crews w o u l d eac h take three bodies                     back to the

rather they were all w r a p p e d                in blankets.             After    colle ct in g

collect a ten year old fatality,                          and to bring the body back

After     the    relatives          had i d entified the bodies,                  we were

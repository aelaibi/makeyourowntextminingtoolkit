Dear Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,

SCRUTINY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER - 15TH APRIL
1989.

Thank you for conducting a Scrutiny of possible fresh evidence
relating to the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster in April 1989.

I am the sister of Andrew Mark Brookes (body no 50), who is
one of the 96 people who lost their lives on that terrible
day.

I find it so very hard to believe and to come to terms with,
the fact that my brother who was 2 6, went out on that
beautiful spring morning so happy and full of joy, to watch
his favourite football team play in a Semi-Final Cup Match and
never to return alive and well back to his family. Andrew was
such a quiet, reserved, happy, laid-back and healthy young
man, who did not have a disagreement with anyone. It was just
not in his nature to argue and certainly not to fight. The
only fighting my brother did that day was for his life.

The fact is, it was not just one person who died but 96. That
to me is not just some accident, and so I ask of you to hold a
fresh inquiry/inquests into the circumstances and'aftermath of
that tragic day.

My reasons being for such a request follow on a separate page.

Yours sincerely




LOUISE BROOKES (sister of the deceased)

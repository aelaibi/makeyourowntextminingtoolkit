HILLSBOROUGH
        j
I am grateful for your note of 19 April which I take as early
warning of a potential call on CID resources. Dr Menzies has
also indicated in his minute of 21 April a specific area where
BRE's expertise might be valuable.       I have minuted him
separately.

I have no doubt that if the Enquiry wishes to pursue lines
which draw on BRE's experience and facilities then we can
arrange to divert some portion of the existing CID programme
in order to provide the required response. We should, however,
not enter into any commitment until CID customers have been
given  the   opportunity  to  re-order   their  priorities  if
resources are to be diverted from the planned programme.

I should be grateful to be kept iin touch with developments.

HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your helpful minute of 27 April. Mr Macpherson
tells me that the subject of crowd control came up at the
recent meeting of BRAC(EE), and that Dr Woolley agreed to
prepare proposals. I anticipate that this will take care of
the longer-term need for basic work in crowd control general-
l y *

As for the specific issue of the Hillsborough Inquiry, I will
make sure that Mr Kinghan is aware that you exist, and we will
have to see what develops subsequently. However, you will know
that the Inquiry is being sponsored by the Home Office, and it
might be that you would want to approach that Department
direct.

It goes without saying that my colleagues at BRE would wish to put their
expertise and facilities at the disposal of the Enquiry into the Hillsborough
tragedy, and into the formulation of any design recommendations that stem from
it. As you know, FRS played the leading technical role in the investigation
of the Bradford FC disaster and have substantial knowledge of crowd behaviour
in emergency situations, as well as detailed knowledge of the safety
parameters for football stadia.     Our loading expertise in the Structural
Divisions at Garston may also be relevant.

No doubt, if our services are called upon, some part of the CID programme
could be employed to resource what is required.

 Following Roger Courtney's minute to you of 19 April, I would certainly
 be pleased to bring the expertise and experience of failures of construction
 systems within my Group at BRE forward to assist.

 You may like to know that the Standing Committee on Structural Safety,
 of which I am a member, has been examining various aspects of the safety
 of sports grounds during the past year and that the Institution of
 Structural Engineers, of which currently I am a Council member and
 Vice-Chairman of its Engineering Committee, has a report on the appraisal
 of safety of sports ground in an advanced state of preparation.

 I believe this work to be highly relevant to the Enquiry and understand
 that the President of the Institution of Structural Engineers is taking
 steps to make it available to the Enquiry as soon as possible.

        Fur th er to my minute to you of 21 April I thought it might be h e l p f u l to
        i ndicate the area in whi ch my Gro up at BRE may be able to assist you
        v it h input to the Inquiry.

        The tragedy at H il l s b o r o u g h is an exa mp le of a d i s a s t e r in w h i c h lives
        a p p ea r to have been lost partly, at least, because of failures of
        stands, barriers, fences or vails wit hi n sports groun ds to p e r f o r m
        witho ut j eo p a r d i s i n g the safety of people in the e x t re me c i r c u m s t a n c e s
        a ss oc i a t e d with high crowd density. We might a n t i c i p a t e that the I n q u i r y
        will consi de r the widest conce iv ab le range of c i r c u ms ta nc es a s s o c i a t e d
        wit h crowd size, density and behaviour, each i nt er a c t i n g w i t h a range of
        sports gro un d facilities for crowd access, a c c o m m o d a t i o n and escape. I
        believe there is scope here for s ys te ma ti c analy se s of each crowd
        s ce na ri o against the perfo rm an ce of every aspect of the f ac il it ie s to
        det e r m i n e w h e th er life safety may be jeopardised. It is in this area
        where, we would be able to make a contribution. I think we could
        con tr ib ut e to such analyses by a s s i s t i n g in d e f i n i n g the f unctions
        required of facilities such as barriers, fences and wal ls - the
        f unctions might include crowd containment, a b i li ty to a ll o w crowd

        mechanisms, etc.                             !

Furth er to my m i n u t e to you of 21 A pr i l I thought it might be h e l p f u l to
indicate the a r e a in w h i c h my Group at BRE may be able to a s s is t y o u
w i t h input to the Inquiry.

T h e tragedy at H i l l s b o r o u g h is an e x a m p l e of a dis as te r in w h i c h lives
a p p ea r to h a v e bee n lost partly, at least, bec au se of failures of
stands, barriers, fences or walls w i t h i n sports grounds to p e r f o r m
w itho ut j e o p a r d i s i n g the s a f et y of peo pl e in the extre me c i r c u m s t a n c e s
a s s o c i a t e d w i t h high crowd density. We might a nt ic i p a t e that the Inq ui ry
w il l c o n s i d e r the w i d es t c on ce iv ab le range of c ir cu ms ta nc es a s s o c i a t e d
w i t h crowd size, d e n s i t y and behaviour, each i nt er ac ti ng w i t h a r an g e of
sports g r o u n d f acilities for crowd access, a c c o m m o d a t i o n and escape. I
b e l ie ve there is sco pe here for s y s t e m a t i c analyses of e a c h crowd
scena ri o again st the p er fo r m a n c e of eve ry aspect of the f a c i l i t i e s to
det e r m i n e w h e t h e r life saf et y may be jeopardised. It is in this a r e a
w he r e we w o u l d be abl e to mak e a contribution. I think we could
c on tr ib ut e to such a na ly se s by a s s i s t i n g in d ef i n i n g the funct io ns
required of f acilities such as barriers, fences and wal ls - the
f unctions mig ht include crowd containment, abili ty to a l l o w crowd
escape, etc. - and by p r o v i d i n g input to the c on si de ra ti on s of the
d e s i g n of s u c h facil it ie s to fulfil the functions i de nt i f i e d - crowd
loading, s t r e n g t h and s ha p e of barriers, press ur e release and e s c a p e
mechanisms, etc.

C l e a r l y a v e r y w id e range of e xp e r t i s e and e xp er ie nc e s h o u l d be brought
bear to e x a m i n e the causes of the H i l l s b o r o u g h tragedy and to d e t e r m i n e
the a c t io ns n e c e s s a r y to prevent r ec ur re nc es of incidents of this sort.
I hop e y o u find h e l pf ul the indic at io ns I hav e giv en abo ve of the a re a
w i t h i n the range w h e r e G&S Gro up at BRE w ou l d be able to m ak e a

Thank you for your helpful minute of 27 April.      Mr Macpherson
tells me that the subject of crowd control came up at the recent
meeting of BRAC(EE), and that Dr Woolley agreed to prepare
proposals. I anticipate that this will take care of the longer-
term need for basic work in crowd control generally.

As for the specific issue of the Hillsborough Inquiry, I will
make sure that Mr Kinghan is aware that you exist, and we will
have to see what develops subsequently.   However, you will know
that the Inquiry is being sponsored by the Home Office, and it
might be that you would want to approach that Department direct.

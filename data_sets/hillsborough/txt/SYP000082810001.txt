makeshift exit i;t ths perimeter fence.                          Someone had managed to pull

back the fencing to provide an exit.                           1 then returned to assist with

whatever was required.                  I had no personal            radio and was not in contact

with any supervisory officer at that stage.

A supporter then grabbed me and shouted,                           “Look,      h e ’s going to die,

h e ’s choking on his own vomit."                     I turned and saw two officers bent-

over a man who was vomiting (identities of officers not known).                                           He

was laid on his back, all I could see were his head and shoulders.                                                It

was impossible to remove this man as he was well and truly trapped

beneath the mass             of bodies.       My      immediate re^fction was to remove                    the

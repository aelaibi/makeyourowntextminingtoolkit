SAY    :-



I am         rears old, born on                             I am presently employed

having      just    been discharged            from     the Army.        I served         in

                      My telephone number is



On the day of            the Hillsborough          incident,      I left home with my

friend |                   |and drove to Hillsborough in my car.                          We left

at about 11.00 a.m.             We arrived at Sheffield at about 2.15 p.m.

and the      traffic was         very heavy.            We were pointed            towards      the

Nottingham         Forest      side    of    the ground      to park.          We     both had

tickets      for    the terraces            and went     straight to      the ground and

arrived at about 2.35 p.m.                    When we first arrived,                there were

a lot o£-_ people milling round and a lot of police horses*—_ We

were not involved in                 the crush but within a few minutes, huge

numbers of people arrived and we were caught in the crush.                                       At

about 2.40 p.m.           a policeman grabbed my friend by                         the arm and

showed him to go under a tape barrier and to go through a gate

which had been opened.                 We went towards           the gate and were one

of the first through and were not involved in the crush at that

stage,      however,      within       a    few moments      there was         a    tremendous

crush as people surged through the gate.                          I saw a young lad of

about 13 getting hit by a police horse which knocked him into

other people.             As   we went        through the        gate    there      were    three

tunnels      ahead       but    by    that     stage     there    were    so       many    people

around us      that we could               only   see   the middle one             and we wfeht
ough it as did everybody else. By the time we got to the end of

the tunnel, the crowd was backed up to the end and you couldp't

actually get into the ground, however,                       the force of the people

pushing from behind              lifted me off my feet and |
                                                           _____ and myself

got split up.           He was pushed to the right of a dividing barrier

at the end of the tunnel and I went to the left.                               I ended up

about 5 or 6 metres from the front of the ground and during all

that   time        my   feet    never     touched      the    ground.     I    was    being

crushed and could just about breath.                      There was a man in front

of me who was pressed against the barrier and he was trying to

scream    to push back as he              couldn't breath.            There was also       a

man of about 24 in a Welsh rugby shirt near me and he fainted.

We were literally screaming at the police to open the gates and

they seemed to be arguing between them but nobody actually did

anything.           Once - they        opened ~ithe _ gates : there       were,       people

climbing across on other people's heads to get out.                            It was the

survival of the fittest.



Even after         the crush subsided people were still panicking and

the police         were   helping       those    who    were    fit   enough     to   climb

through     instead       of    jostling       them    and   helping    those     who   had

collapsed to get out.              I carried the man who was in front of me

out,   I believe he            subsequently died.            We were carrying people

out but    we couldn't           get    them    through the gate        onto     the pitch

because    the people weren't             telling       those who were able bodied

to get back.            We had to actually carry people out through the

entrance      to    the ground         that    we had    entered      through.        Having
 been in the Army, I was used to dealing with casualties having

 been       trained      for    it and we were           just      running        in and out          for

 about       25    minutes       getting      casualties        out.         It    struck me        how

 unprofessional the police were,                       they clearly did not know what

 to    do    or    how    to     deal    with    people      who    had      been       crushed.         I

walked around             for quite a while             afterwards           talking         to people

and reassuring                them and putting          them in        the correct position

for people who had breathing problems ie. in the prone position

and clearing their airways.                      Quite a few of the people we did

take     out       the back       entrance       did    die*       I have         not    been    to    a

football match since and don't think I will ever go again.



I sustained heavy bruising                      down both sides           of my back and my

chest.           I suffer from asthma anyway and am familiar with this

pain        in    my     chest     and    have        therefore        not        sought      medical

assistance.             I have also come out in various rashes and saw my

doctor, Dr |                   1 locum at I                                        [     He said he

wasn t sure what it was.                   I have not been sleeping properly*



At first after the incident,                     I was very angry and fought with

those around me.               I was running around and there weren't enough

hours       in    the    day     for    me.      I   have    been      very       short      with   my

family, snapping at them for the slightest thing.



I normally go to bed at about 11.00 p.m. but was finding that I

couldn't          get    to    sleep     until       about     2.00    a.m.        so    I    started

staying up til about 1.00 a.m. but still found that I couldn't

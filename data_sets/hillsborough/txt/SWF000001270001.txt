    1.1
      The match will attract   a capacity crowd of        approximately
55 , 00 0 spectators. A larQe percentage of the crowd will travel by
road, either by coach or priv     ate  car. Special tr ai ns will alco
co nve y Liverpool fans to   Wadsley Bridge s t at io n a nd Nottingham
Fo rr es t supporters  to  Sheffield Midland station.       A convoy of
buses will transport fans     arriving  at Sheffield Midland to the
ground. The gates at the     ground will be open from 11am.

    1.2
     It is the intention of the Road Traffic    D i v i s i o n to assist
the free movement of traffic  and the   segregation of supporters
both  before  and after   the  game  so as   to     cause       as little
inconvenience as possible both to persons attending the match and
to the general public.

        Superintendent Brougham will be    in overall command assisted
by Inspector Scholey. C h i e f Inspector    Shaw will be in command of
the sector north of the        ground  i.e.   the Liverpool   routes and
C h i e f Inspector Lax will   be in command of the sector south of the
g r o u n d i.e. the Nottingham Forest routes.

2.2
          Traffic Division night staff on Friday   14th April 1989 will
remain        on  duty until 8.00am. Unless instructed otherwise the 6
—    2 d staff on 15th April and    all  officers involved on duties re
the natch will work from       08.00 until    approximately   20.00. No
o f f i c e r will retire from duty  unless authorised by asupervisory
 'fficer.


          All intersections on the motorway and all key traffic points
will be manned from 10am. There           will   be car patrols detailed to
s e c t i o n s of the motorway and    motorcycle    patrols   covering other
routes.          All  officers  must   ensure   that football     traffic  is
c o r r e c t l y directed. Officers on static      points   must ensure that
p r i o r i t y is   given to   the   heaviest   traffic   flow   which will
o b v i o u s l y be the football    traffic.   All   officers   at locations
c o n t r o l e d by automatic traffic signals    will be issued with a key
to t u r n off the lights as and        when   necessary.There are bound to
be locations where traffic will           build   up and delays occur. This
c o u l d lead to frustration       particularly    by anyone not attending
the natch. Officers          should   therefore   deal   firmly but friendly
w i t h any complaints re traffic movement.

              I refer to the correspdrtdence frocoi.Qiie.f Superintendent (MS) in
              respect of the above.             •T'r- -

              Enclosed for information is a copy of the Certificate issued by
              the then South Yorkshire County Council in Decamber 1979* Also
              attached is a copy of the first Draft prepared by the City Council
              in August 1987.                ____

              Referring to the latter could I draw your attention to paragraphs
                 5 fc 6 which have been totally deleted from the new draft.
              Siailalrly could I draw your attention to paragraph 10 which outlined the
              duties of stewards. To some degree the first draft aade the stewards
              answerable to police officers. In the latest draft the reference to
              police has been totally removed.

              Generally speaking the new draft certificate ,apart from matters
              relating to the police, is reasonably consistent with the first
              draft. However you may consider it appropriate at some stage to seek
              the views of Chief Superintendents Broomhead and Duckenfield.

Description           PHE HATCH 6RXEFING FA CUP SEMI FINAL GIVEN 14.4.89




  F A CUP SEMI FINAL - FRIDAY 14 APRIL 19S9



  Ladies and Gentlemen

             *

  The event tomorrow is the FA Cup Semi Final                  beteen Liverpool and

  Nottingham Forest.              The kick off is at 3 o ’clock this afternoon and          •

  the gates will            be open at 12 noon.



  However,         there will     Inevitably be a number of supporter* who arrive

  early and we shall have a certain number of gate* in. all parts of tfie

  g r o u n d \ h a y will be capable of opening from 11am and we will

  endeavour to get people Into the ground as quickly as possible.



  I ruust stress that if supporters do not have a ticket then whatever

  they say they will              not be allowed into the ground.



  The ground has a capacity of 54,000 people.                   It i* an all-ticket

  m^tch and all tickets have been sold so there is no rooft for anyone                      •
                                                                                      •A   '•*
  who does not have a ticket because we will break safety limits.



  The stadium has been divided to ensure maximum segregation and. to

  reduce any possibility of public disorder.



  Th* West Stand to my left, otherwise known as the Lt-pjurHMv

  and th* stand that you are fitting in now,
                                                                     PAGE
                                                                     D12

•ar*» for U-? Liverpool Supporters.   All access to these areas is at

th-it end vr<ich is the l.epping? Lane End.



Th* Nottingham Forest Supporters have been allocated tickets for the

Spion Kop, which is on my right, and the South Stand, which is

directly behind me and where the Director** Box and the Player*

Tunnel   is.



To ensure that supporter* from Nottingham Fore»t do not flow along

the back cf the South Stand and toward* Lepping* Lane End we have

created a sterile area along the back of that *tand.



Tickets are colour-coded and clearly identified for the section* of

the ground, and when asked for advice you should examine the ticket,

and give Information accordingly.     Copie* of.the ticket* are on

di*play on the information board*. •



The routine vehicles and spectator* ha* been designed to bring

Liverpool Support** into that end of the ground which i* easily

accessible to them, and in simple terms that 1* from the north and

the Nottingham Forest fans have been routed from the south to

approach South Side of the ground.                                   ‘



If the teams are drawing at full time today there will be extra time

and all cut plans need to be adjusted accordingly.



There is one difficulty with the two teams, and that 1« with regard

to identification of the fans by colour*.     Those of you   with

football knowledge will appreciate that both Liverpool and No.ttlng*
                                         $    *-
v;filay in red in normal league match**, and their cupporter* usually^
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            D 12


    we-ar rao and white.



    On the d^y no doubt the -Tans will still wear their       normal supporters

    colours,    but on the field I -am told that Liverpool will wear their

    usual red strip and Nottingham     will play In white.



    It it our intention today that     this match will take    place without any

    public d i s o r d e r and we must ensure the safety of the public, both

    Inside and outside the ground, and segregate the opposing fans*



0   This will mean control by Police Officers and in addition to ensure

    things run smoothly there will be no obstruction of the highway and '

    we must be extremely vigilant to ensure that there is no damage to

    property,   either   in the ground or in the vicinity of the ground.



    I will expect a high standard of turnout,      good attitude towards

    members of the public, and professionalisn that reflects credit not

    only on the police service in general, but on South Yorkshire Police

    in particular.



    I want the public to be treated properly but thoses who transgress

    dealing with firmly but fairly within the law .                     t          ..


    I cannot stress too highly the word ’S a f e t y ’.   the ground will be       .

    full to capacity today and some of you may never have experienced a

    football match of this nature.      Our job is to ensure the safety o f .

    spectators and you must make sure you know the escapes routes; the',

    problem areas, and that you are fully conversant with your'

    responsibilities should a crisis arise.       There will be a tr.viseJM^Mp

    atmosphere within the ground but you must not be caught, .up

7      ev;nts   that a r e taking place on the field, you must r e m a i n

detached arsd clear headed at all tifties to respond to events.



I shall be in overall command of the operation but have delegated

certain areas of res puns 1b i 1ity to particular Superintendent* who

will have a number of Senior Officer# under their command.



The Control Room, which is in the far corner to my left and is the

blue box attached to the South Standr will be commanded.by

Superintendent Murray.



Superintendent Greenwood will have command within the Stadium and

touch line level.



Superintendent Marshall will have responsibility for the Liverpool

Supporters on the north side of the ground, and Superintendent

Chapman will have responsibility for the Nottingham Forest Fan* who

are approaching from the south *1de of the g round•



All Inspectors who attended the briefing yesterday, these officers

will, at the end of this briefing, speak to their respective

contingents and advise them of what they expect and of the particul

problems in their area.



Any difficulties or any decision* within thoses areas will be taken

by Section Superintendents.         I should at this point mention CID

natters,     there are teams of detectives in the area and Detective

Superintendent McKay Is responsible for crime matters.             :

                                                                               '   t

           14.C J t n e   fan; arriving at that, location can wall, easily into the

           g»ound and withuut too much difficulty.                    4 trains from Nottingham

           will     arrive at the Sheffield Midland Station,               between 12.30pm and

           l.KOpm and buses are being provided to the ground.



           the return journey for the Nottingham fans travelling by train may be

           a little different.             Buses will be parked outside the ground in

           Penistone Road North,            facing towards City, and fans will be able to

           get on these and eventually make their way back to the City Centre.

           1he train times will, be adjusted to ensure that Nottingham fan* don't

           misa    their train,      either by traffic congestion or extra time, but

           they should not be allowed to dawdle along the route.                    I should

           mention at this point that whilst there is a rigid policy with regard

           to Liverpool       fans arriving by a special train into Wadsley Bridge

           Station.       About    1,000 will no doubt arrive by service train and

           travel from the City Centre by bus.                                                          .   '.i

           These Liverpool         fans who have arrived at the Midland Station and

           travel by bus will          be directed to Liverpool allocated transport

           department       buses that will be parked near Wadsley Bridge Station and

           they will       be conveyed to Sheffield City Centre.



           Gentlemen,       the order covers most eventualities and I can't in this

           limited time cover everything,              but there will be additional briefings.;'

           by your Supervisory Officers and your              Inspectors have had a copy of                 "

           the Operational Order and are fully conversant with what our

           intentions       are   today.

     There is one difficulty with the two teams,                         and that is with recard

                                         Briefing Notes

 On Friday the 14th April after the main briefing to Inspectors and above held at

 Hillsborough I then briefed Inspectors and above whe were to be under my command at

 the semi-final match.


 I told than that in particular from experience I could forsee two problems arising.

 One was the question of supporters from the Leppings Lane terrace being hauled up by

 feilow supporters into the West Stand at half time thus creating over capacity in

 the West Stand.   The second problen I related was based on experience of the semi­

 final match between the same teams last year in that it was quite forseeable that

 there would be a large element of Liverpool supporters v.nc by whatsoever means would

 be purchasing tickets for the Spion Kop.      This problem had beer, evident last year

and that cordoning Police Officers had come under threat to personal safety.              It was

agreed with the Inspectors concerned that we would go to the Spion Kop after my

briefing and axanine the area and how it could best be Drotected.
                                                       *       ft and reserved for
Liverpool supporters.


I specifically spoke in clear terms about behaviour of Liverpool supporters based on

my previous experience.    I told Officers that in niy view generally speaking if

things were going well for Liverpool supporters crowd manag^ient should be

reasonably well achieved, however should things in any way not go well them then

they had proved extremely difficult to contain and moods would easily change.              I

related_an_lncident. to them which I .had witnessed uccurring at a Sheffield Wednesday

- Liverpool match during thr- period of the Coal Indus tr\              .     1: was a i tnj;

tine at I recnl 1 that tne then i;op wab over capacity with Sne*:i«_•ic* Wcdnescay

supporters ana out of necessity same v.ere transferred to         pen on the Leppings Lane

terracing (the Liverpool supporters occupying the Uest End oi m e ground including

the terracing).    A pen was left empty between Liverpool supporters and those

Sheffield Wednesday supporters that had been transferred and a line of Officers was

put in the vacant pen between the supporters.       On transierrine the Sheffield

Wednesday supporters the Liverpool supporters wen: wild attesting to scale the

jt-;jwing in a." attempt to get to the       fie’c V.edr.rscav suzr-ortors.    Itwns necessarv
    for same Officers to draw truncheons to contain the Liverpool supporters.


    I reminded Officers of the need for     extreme care insearching supporters and          to bear

    in mind the dangers of weapons suchas Stanley knives, knives        or sharp bladed

    articles which may be retained in a     persons pocket. Officers were also told of the

dangers of weakening a police line by taking away supporters either under arrest or

    for the purpose of ejecting them thus reducfng the police cover and thereby

potentially putting their colleagues at greater risk to their personal safety.


Above all I told the Officers that in my view a successful operation hinged direct^

on the alertness of Constables and that i: they were to be seen as not being awake

    to potential problems then supporters would readily take advantage o! the situation.

On conclusion of the briefing i then went to the bpion Kop with Inspectors tc

discuss specific plans in relation to the segregation of Liverpool supporters '.of

whom it may be expected that there would be more than last year] from Not tinsh?:::

Forest supporters on whai was an area u.ith a capacity for containing 21.000 people.


I also reminded Officers that sune Liverpool supporters had climbed over the

Leppings Lane perimeter fenee at the end of last yearn semi final game and the:

manpower had been arranged to prevent a repetition n           also discussed separate;', wit*

Inspector Darling the normal plan to iunnel players and officials into the player's

tunnel at the end of the game).

    Chief Inspector Beal, Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspector Calvert, all of whom

    have had extensive experience of policing the Hillsborough stadium, were not present

    at my briefing on Friday but on Saturday I discussed with them the particular

    problems, as outlined previously, I had foreseen as would affect their areas of

    responsibili ty.


    At the conclusion of my briefings I confirmed that everyone was familiar with their

    allocated duties.

This      incident                created          a       recording             of    all     information/incidents                              relating                 to

There         is    an    entry          timed             at    0828       from       Superintendent MURRAY                               indicating                that
this     message              is    to       be    left          open       as       instructed             and       all messages                to do w i t h

I draw         to       your       attention                to       one    entry          dated       1444.              This       is    an    entry
inserted            at    that          time       from          FI       Hamilton          Road       Police             Station          by    Pc    BARNES.
 (A     statement             from       this          officer             is    being        obtained).                   The m e ssage              recorded
states         "From          Superintendent                         MARSHALL          FI ,    request               contact          ground          to    tanoy            a
request            for    people             not       to       push       at    Leppings             Lane       entrance".                 Passed          to
Police         Sergeant             GODARD,                ground          control.            It      is       believed             that       difficulties
in      radio       communication                      on       the       ground       control             led       to    Superintendent
MARSHALL            changing             his       radio             channel          to    contact             his       local       police          station
for      they       in     turn         to    contact                the    ground          control             by    telephone             means.


Appendix            "B"       refers          to       a    second          log.           This       is    a    ground           control         log       created
 again        by    Superintendent                         MURRAY          and       referred          to       in his        statement.                   As       t he
ground         control             commander                he       identified             a weakness                through             a post       match
briefing            through             the       lack          of    a    log       during       the       1988          semi       final.           It was             his
 intention              for       this       year          to    create          a    log w h i c h         he       did     and w h i c h        starts             0800
 control           operative             PS       616       and       PC    1035.           The       log       then       relates          to    various
 incidents              throughout                the       morning             and    concludes                at    1421        hours.          It       is
 believed           that          there       is       only          one    tape       recording                of    any      radio        messages                and
 that     related             to    the       force             control          room       and       this       is       being       transcribed                   at
 this     moment           but      is       believed                not    to       possess          too m u c h          important             evidence.
 Neither           the     local         sub divisional                         radio       nor       the       ground         control           radio were
 tape     recorded                and    there             are       no    sound       recordings                of       the m e s s a g e s         in    that
 box.


Actions            are w e l l          advanced                to    obtain          statements                from       the       persons          involved
 in     the    ground             control          and          should          be    on    hand       by       Friday         at     the       latest.

CONCLUSIONS
This man was involved in a mass movement of the crowd at the semi final football match
at Hillsborough on Saturday 15th April, 1989.
This man appeared to be normally developed and healthy and I have found no natural disease
which cculd have caused or contributed to his death. In my view he had a normal
expectation of life for his age. He had clearly, at some tine, been pressed against some
sciid object, such as a rail, which had marked across the front of the lower pelvis.
Ultimately he was unable to move his chest in respiration, and thus perished from
asphyxia. There is now no medical reason why the body may not be disposed of.
I have retained a sample of blood tor analysis should you deem this necessary.

 Dear Sirs,

                                             Re: Ground Safety

       Following the tragic events at Sheffield Wednesday F. C. last
 Saturday, you are instructed to undertake, in conjunction with
 your Local Licensing Authority, a^ zm me d ia te review of ground
 safety.    This should include the perimeter fencing installed, the
 agreed capacity levels of all standing areas and thes^rfcutes to and
 from the ground.                                       f £ )

      A report should then be forwarded to The Football
 Association, stating any immediate action taken to implement
 changes and any longer term measures that you have initiated.
 You should also advise us if no changes have been found necessary.

                                             Yours faithfully,

                 *■                Estimated Terrace Capacity

           I refer to the telephone call between Mr. Bovnes and my Principal District
           Surveyor, Kr. 3utler, earlier this afternoon.

           The approximate holding capacities produced for the standing terrace
           areas do not take account of any turnstile ingress limitations, or
           those of egress or emergency egress limitations since it is my understanding
           that the Fire Authority will consider all these matters being that they
           have the primary function of estimation of terrace capacity.

           These figures therefore need to be carefully checked with those produced
           by the Fire Authority to ensure that account is taken of the need for
           any further limitations for the purposes of the proposed certificate
           amendment.

           My calculations based on the "green guide" modified by the Taylor Inquiry
           recommendations give the following:-

           1.   Spion Kop                  ^   18,200
           2.   North West Terrace (Upper)      2,300
           3.   North West Corner (Lower)         630         (Pen 7)

           In accordance with our consultations, figures have not been produced for
           Pens one to six of the West Terrace.

           I would appreciate the sight of the Fire Authority figures before- the
           Certificate is amended.

                                 NORTH WEST TERRACING - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
                                 SWPC v SHEFFIELD UNITED - 21 NOVEMBER 1989


                  Approximately five minutes before the kick off at 8 pm I went to the rear
                  of the North West Terracing where I saw 200/300 people standing in the
                  gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells being unable to gain access
                  into the terraced area.   Having examined the situation I realised that
                  there was no way this number could safely be accommodated within that
                  terraced area and I made inmediate plans to have them transferred to
                  available seating within the North Stand.      Whilst carrying out this
                  exercise I was informed by Chief Inspector Beal that a further 100/150
                  spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane waiting to be admitted.

                  On ny instructions the turnstiles were closed and were not re-opened
                  until the people who had been unable to gain access to the North West
                  Terracing had been placed in the North Stand.         Having successfully
                  achieved this I then arranged for the spectators who had been waiting
                  outside to be also accommodated within the North Stand.

                  I am concerned that the present Safety Certificate allows 2300 people to
                  be acconmodated within the North West Terraces as a contingency, and
                  having discussed the matter with Superintendent Sleath and Mr. Mackrell,
                  Secretary of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, we are all agreed
                  that this figure should now be revised to 1500 maximum.

             Capacity of Upper North West terrace

             Subsequent to a naeting at Hanmerton Road Police Station on 22nd November
             to discuss various natters arising fran the match between Sheffield
             Wednesday and Sheffield United on 21st Noventer, I have had cause to
             revise the recctmended holding capacity for this area of the ground.
                                                            #      ’*     ..


             You will recall that the present capacity figures were produced within
                    on list August, 1989, and therefore only a paper exercise was
             carried out m that restrictive tine.

             A            earlier today revealed the extent of the area of terrace
             partially blinded by the screen between the North West Terrace and the
             North Stand.

            Accordingly that area has been emitted from the gross available area of
            terrace.                       t



            Th e hoiding capacity of the regaining areas has been re-calculated and
            modified in accordance with the Taylor recommendations, ■giving a resultant
            rigure of 1,7170.

            Eastvreod and Partners drawing number 1610/64E has been used for the layout
            ot^this area. In a telephone conversation between Mr Stranpe of Eastwood
            and Partners and my Principal Structural Engineer, late this afternoon, it
            was intiaated that this drawing nay not be accurate, and that the gross
            available space nay be slightly smaller than is shown on the drawing

                              ^>as ^een^resurveyed and revised drawings received, I would
            reccmrena that the holding capacity for the Upper North West Terrace be a
            rraxuriLEn of 1/500.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - THfc NORTH VEST TERRACE

As you are aware, on the evening of 21 November 1989 Sheffield Wednesday played
Sheffield United at the Hillsborough Stadium. As a contingency the north west
terrace was taken into use to accommodate the Sheffield United fans. The present
capacity of this terrace is 2300 but, in the view of the officer in charge on the
night - Chief Superintendent Nesbit 1F 1 Division - that number cannot be safely
accommodated. Approximately five minutes before the kick-off there were 200/300
people standing in the gangways and at the bottom of the stairwells, being unable
to gain access into this terrace. Having examined the situation, Chief
Superintendent Nesbit concluded that this number of people could not be safely
accommodated within the terraced area and made pleas to have them transferred to
another part of the ground. Whilst this exercise was being carried out it was
seen that a further 100/150 spectators were still outside in Leppings Lane
waiting to be admitted. These people, too, were accommodated in the north stand.

It will be seen that around 450 people could not be accommodated and this was at
a time when tickets had been sold which should have ensured that the capacity
would not have been exceeded.

It is the view of Chief Superintendent Nesbit that the capacity for this north
west terrace should be reduced, and he has held preliminary discussions with the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackrell, who has agreed
that a realistic figure should be 1500 maximum.




                                                                                C o n t'd       . . .

                                                                                       • «/

                                                                                 3403
Clearly, urgent attention needs to be given to this natter since the fixture next
week on 29 November - Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool - is expected to draw a
good crowd end it would seen that lessons had not been learnt if on that night
gates had to be closed before the official maximum capacity had been reached.

I await your early reply.

Yours faithfully

            Capacities of Terrace Areas at Certificated Football Grounds and in
       particular the North West Upper Terrace, Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground


       1.        Introduction

       1.1       On Wednesday, 22nd November, 1989 at the request of the South Yorkshire
                 Police, Officers from the Administration and Legal Department, the
                 Department of Land and Planning and the South Yorkshire Fire Service
                 attended at Hammerton Road Police Station to view extracts from the
                 Police video of the football match that had taken place at Hillsborough
                 Sports Stadium the night before.

       1.2      The Police highlighted the problem that had been experienced by a
                number of spectators in the North West Upper Terrace of the Ground and
                the action they had taken to alleviate the prob lem.x    ^Z c TigS

       1.3      It was suggested that in the absence of further data, a revised
                capacity of 1,500 be placed in this area and that the General Safety
                Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club be amended
                to reflect this.  It was pointed out by the Police that the Club had no
                objection to this and the proposal was confirmed by Mr. Mackrell on
                behalf of the Club on Thursday, 23rd November, 1989.

   1.4          The General Safety Certificate was amended with the approval of the
                Chairman of the General Purposes Panel on Friday, 24th November, 1989.
                I attach a copy of the amendment.

   2.           Building Surveyor's Memorandum of 23rd November,         1989

   2.1          Mr. Butler informed my Chief Licensing Officer (Sports Grounds), Mr.
                Derricott, in a telephone conversation at approximately 10.30 a.m. on
                23rd November, that Mr. Strange of Messrs. Eastwood & Partners,
                Consulting Engineers, had spoken to Mr. Sherriff, Principal Structural
                Engineer, Department of Land and Planning, and suggested that the plan
                on which capacities had been calculated for the North West Upper
                Terrace of the West Terrace was incorrect.

   2.2          Mr. Butler confirmed this in a memorandum to me dated 23rd November,
                1989, and received by my Chief Licensing Officer at 11.30 a.m. on 24th
                November, 1989.  I would draw your attention to paragraph 6 of the
                memorandum.

   2.3          The capacity of 2,300 was incorporated into the Safety Certificate
                after I received a memorandum from the Building Surveyor dated 11th
                August, 1989 (copy attached).  This amendment was authorised by the
                Panel at its meeting on 17th August, 1989.
 Messrs.     Eastvood & P a rtn ers

 My Assistant Solicitor, Krs. Woodhead, telephoned Messrs. Eastwood &
 Partners on Friday afternoon, 24th November, 1989 at approximately
 1.00 p.m. and spoke with a Mr. Strange.

rMr. Strange pointed out that a revised plan was being drawn up based on
 calculations that had been made that day.  He informed my Assistant
 Solicitor that the initial calculations for the area put the capacity
 at 1,594.  This figure has not yet been confirmed by Messrs. Eastwood &
 Partners .

 My Assistant Solicitor queried whether or not the plans for the Spion
 Kop Terrace area were correct. Mr. Strange confirmed that the plans
 deposited with the Council for the Spion Kop were, as far as he was
 aware, up to date and correct.

 I have written to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners confirming my Assistant
 Solicitor's telephone conversation and inviting a representative to the
 Panel meeting on 27th November (copy letter attached).

To confirm the actions of the Chairman in conjunction with the Head of
Administration and Legal Department in authorising the amendment to the
General Safety Certificate in respect of Sheffield Wednesday Football

To consider what further action, if any, is needed in view of the
forthcoming match on Wednesday, 29th November, 1989.

 .tents and z'r.cse scaled from the drawing based upon that
 provided by the Club.       Instead of z'r.e 29CO which had
 r.cticnally been considered to be      -he capacity of the upper
 L\crth West corner,     the total area available wo ul d only take
 2242 on the basis of 54 spectators to iCrtr .
        The discrepancy between the drawing and the actual measurer,en
 is not in any way apparent from a visual inspection of the terrace
 At the tirr.e when we were reporting in 197 2, we were made
 aware that in September 1970,      following a report by the Club's
 previous consultants the police had agreed a capacity for the
 elevated :icrth '.Test corner cf 2,CCG spectators.      That figure
 or a higher one had been used in all the m a j o r ca~.es from the
 World Cup in 1966.      There was thus no reason for us to be alerted
 in 1973/79.     We enclose a copy cf the 1970 report and the Chief
 Constable's   letter to the Club dated 30 September 1970.
       Obviously we have been concerned about the possibility that
 the calculations for the terrace in front of the West stand might
 also have been based on a misleading plan.         Cur check measurements
 have shown that the actual area is such that it could accommodate
 the   'notional'   number cf spectators with a slightly lower density
 than 54 per 1 0 m 2 .


                                 Yours sincerely,

               Capacity of Klllsborcu ~h Stadium

     Th?.r.k you for your letter cf DCth July cn.clcsin.-5 a
copy cf tne Chief Constable's letter uatcd loth July in
connection with the Ground Capacity of h'illsbor'.urn
Stadium.

     I       understand the words "scientific calculation-1 were
used by your ^oocself in tne original terms of reference
to us but in the absence of any known formula we have
dealt "with this matter by empirical means.

        Ve assembled a small c r o w d of people in our dra^in^
office to represent a sample of r. crowd str-nding reasonably
close to :etaer.    i.'e then established a coefficient of 1.3^
lineal feet per person on each step of terrace, each person
be in 7, allocated the full depth of the terrace whatever its
dimension.

     We then referred to our detailed surveys of the terrace
tnd we also measured on site the Sen-own usable length of the
terrace steps, m^klns due allowance for ^on-r.vays, passageways,
stairways, etc. and the length of eacn section was civided
by the coefficient to establish the capacity.

     We re.-ard the fore 5. in*; r.3 an interin approach to the
problem, until such time as tiie ccefficic-nt could be checked
by the use cf crowd counting devices.

                               Yours si p cerely

Dear    Eric,
                Safety Certificate J.979 - Professional Fees
       As the work associated with obtaining the safety certificate
1979 plus the rewiring of the South stand etc. is now complete
                                   retention nonies at the end of the
maintenance period, I have pleasure in presenting'our fee account.
You will recall that last February the charges for our professional
services were agreed at £18,000 plus of course the cost of testing
and retesting the crush barrier* of £ 3 ,5 0 0 .'   We had £5,000 in
fees last year which leaves £16,500 outstanding.
       When sending fees accounts X like to say thank you for
employing us but in this case it has been a. particularly pleasant
experience working with you.


                                         Yours sinoerely,




                                                                             H z

B. HcGem E s q . ,                                       8 May 1986
Chairman, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
c/o Presto Tools,
Penistone Road,
Sheffield 6.



Dear Chairman,
                     Roofing of the Kop
         I have pleasure in enclosing a oopy of the latest
programme for the works.     You will see. that thip shows only a
few items not completed by Saturday., .23 August •   These should .
not interfere with the adalsslon of spectators.      The programme
is tight, and a lot of windy or wet weather could make it
difficult to keep to programs.      But the whole team has the
right spirit.
         At the progress meeting .. with the contractor held
                                     «        « . .  .
yesterday all critical path items were in line with the programme.
Sone non-critical items are up to one week late, but these do
not cause any concern at present.
         The crane is due to arrive on site on Wednesday, 14
May, and will be erected before the weekend.     Steelwork erection
will coemence as programmed on 19 May.     Our inspectors reports
on the blast-cleaning and painting of the steel are complimentary.
         Beevor Concrete appear to be well up to prograsuae and
           i                                 „
my engineer's report on the concrete units which have already been
                          >          *
cast says the quality of finish is good.
         I aa going away on holiday for just over two weeks,
starting next weekend.     Richard Sastwood and Alan Wood^ltw$> of
my partners) will both be available should any emergency arise,
whilst I am away.
            You very kindly asked me to let you know our fee
position.      Attached is a schedule of fee accounts for all
the vork we have done for the club in the last 16 months
since January, 1985.      The years work on the Lepplngs Lane
end, the south stand deck, painting the north stand, testing
crush barriers and general safety vork and negotiations was
all charged for on 9 December.      He drafted the accounts in
such a way as to maximise the grants for the club whilst at
the same time giving discounts.      The photocopy of the carbon
of my letter of S December will explain all this.
            I sent our first invoice for services in connection
with the Kop on 17 February.      You will probably know that
the fees which I agreed vlth Dick and Keith represent a
substantial discount on the normal scale.      I have also not
charged for the abortive designs for a Kop roof with boxes,
nor for the studies on the south stand roof which were carried
out last year.     I also do not intend to charge for the abortive
work in changing all our drawings to oailt the concrete and steel
deck, a completely new set of calculations for the Town Hall,
and then changing back again.      As a result we are now losing
heavily on the project, but of course thirels a payback in the
form of publicity.
            X refrained from sending Interim fee accounts for the
Kop roof, the first of which was due in August 1985, when our
sketch designs were approved by the club and planning consent
obtained.      By February we had finished all design (the
first design) and were due to 85% of our fees.      You will see
that at that stage we were owed a total of £80,682 plus £12,102
V.A.T.   We received £25,000 (£21,739 fees plus £3,261 V.A.T.) on
17 March.      This almost cleared the accounts for last years work.
Including the fees for the Kop, the outstanding fees are now
£58,942.98 plus £8,841.45 V.A.T., making £67,784.43 in total.
            Z very much appreciate your raising the point.

                                Yours sincerely,
                                                            RKG/KH

For the attention of Mr. 0. Maokrell

Dear Graham,
              Facilitiea for the Disabled in the Horth Stand
     We have now prepared our fee account which Z have pleasure in
enclosing.
     You will see that this has been made out on a time basis
mainly because we were subjected to a great deal of time wasting
by the local authority and the working party.      You will recall
that there were arguments about the width of the rasp, about the
hand rails,and particularly about the level of the safety rail
in front of the wheelchairs.         Z became heavily involved in the
arguments, including a special visit to satisfy myself that what
we were proposing was right.      John had to arrange a sp * 4 | i
meeting with members of the working party.     A number of alterations
had to be made to our drawings although we did manage to limit the
extra expenditure>^9£:|5t having a horizontal rail approximately attthe
eye level of the people in the wheelchairs.
      Zt will be seen that my time has not been charged for. Ke have
also not charged for travelling expenses and prints of drawings
both of which are admissible in the normal conditions     engagement,
tfe have also then deduced 10% from the hourly rate charges.
Zn total, our various discounts add up to about 20% of the bill
which a u n i that ws have worked it i k
sargins, without discount, usually wor)
You will also rsoall that we paid our <
cartoon showing th« facility for uss ix
was   £100 which we have been pleased tc
contribution.
      Kith all good wishes for Christsai

Football Club pic

The directors present herewith the audited accounts of the company for the year ended 31st May, 1385.
Financial Results and Dividends
The revenue account Is set out on page 3. The directors recommend no dividend be paid.
Review of the Year
The principal activity of your company continues to be that of a professional football club.
The Season 1984/85 will be remembered by all connected with the dub for our successful return to the 1st Division
after fourteen years absence. W e finished in eighth position: a very creditable performance In our first season back
in the top flight when we were challenging for a place in Europe until virtually the last match.
In the M ilk Cup we again reached the quarter final, eventually losing to Chelsea after three memorable games which
were each watched by crowds in excess of 36,000.
In the FJ l Cup a 3-2 away defeat at the hands of Ipswich Town saw our exit in the fifth round.
Our Central and Northern Intermediate sides also had better seasons finishing 6th and 9th in their respective
leagues.
Nigel Worthington received his Northern Ireland International Cap whilst Tony Gregory and Kevin Pressman both
received their England Youth International Caps.
The average home gate for league matches was 27,000 and our supporters received national acclaim for their
exemplary conduct by being awarded a “Top of the Kops“ award by a leading national newspaper.
Our successful season, however, has been tempered by severe crowd disturbances at matches in which our club
had not been taking part and in particular fay the tragic disasters at the Bradford City ground and the Heysel
Stadium in Belgium. The subsequent redactions by H.M. Government and the football authorities will have tar
reaching effects on soccer generally in this country and may inevitably adversly affect our club at least in the short
term.
Financially our year was also very satisfactory showing a surplus before tax of £493-579 despite having paid out
transfer fees totalling £667,750 against those received of £592,500. The club continued with its policy of improving
the amenities for spectators by spending the sum of £492,000 on additional facilities.
The directors wish to thank, on your behalf, aJI the players and staff for their excellent efforts during the season and
in particular Howard Wilkinson, our manager, and Dick Chester, our secretary, for the very creditable achievements.

Fixed Assets
The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out on pages 6 & 7. In view of the specialised
use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
tne market value over book value. The buildings will continue to be maintained lo their present standard and it is not
considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint the auditors, Pannell Kerr Forster, will be proposed at the annual general meeting.

            The company has accumulated tax losses totalling approximately £450,000 which are available to offset
            against any future taxable profits arising from trading activities.

       10. Directors Emoluments
           No emoluments have been paid to the directors during the year.

       11. Fixed Assets - Tangible
          The increase in book value at 9th January, 1975 to £1,000,000 followed a professional valuation by Messrs
           Eadon Lockwood & Riddle on that date of £2,312,000. This valuation was made on the basis of depreciated
          replacement cost, but in view of the specialised nature of the stadium, the directors felt it was inappropriate
           to include the asset in the accounts at that figure. As there is no intention to dispose of the property, no
           provision has been made for an estimated potential tax charge of £128,000 which would arise on a sale at
          book value.

                                                                       At 1/6/84       Additions    Disposals      At 31/5/85

Except for the effects of accounting for depreciation on the freehold stadium in the manner described in the
preceding paragraph, in our opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Club at 31st May 1985, and of the surplus and source and application of funds, for the year then ended and comply
with the Companies Act 1S85.

     The increase in book value of freehold land and building; a t 9fh January. 1975 to £1,000.000 followed a
     professional valuation by M esas Eadon Lockwood & Riddle on lh at dale of £ZS12fiOQ. TJvs valuation was
     madeon the basis of depreciated replacement co s. but in view of the speciaEsed nature of the stadium, the
     directors fell it was inappropriate to include the asset m the accounts et that figure. As there is no intention to
     dispose of the property, no prevision has been made for sn estimated potential tax charge of £123,000 which
     would arise on a sale at book value.

Football Club pic                                                      For the Year ended 31st May, 1987



The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the company, together with the accounts and auditors’ report,
for the year ended 31st May, 1987.

Principal Activity and Business Review
The principal activity of the company continues to be that of a professional football club.
After a good start it was somewhat disappointing in finish in thirteenth place in the First Division, .but once again we fared
wen in the F.A. Cup only to loss at home to the eventual winners Covenuy City in the 6th Round.
Nigel Worthington and Siggf Jonsson once again regularly represented their countries. Carl Bradshaw, Tony Gregory,
David Hirst and Kevin Pressman all played for England at Under 19 level as did Scott Cam at Under 17. and this bodes
well for the future of the chib.
The hlghspot of the year however was the opening of the new Kop complete with its magnificent roof, surely the finest
structure of its Kind in the Football League, by Her Majesty the Queen on 12th December1986. Aday for all of us to remember.
We wish to take this opportunity, on yourbehalf, of thanking all membersofstafffortheir valuable work done during the year.

 Results and Dividends
 Results, dividends and recommended transfers to reserves are as follows:
 Retained profit at 1st June 1986                                                                                £1.639.289

 The directors who retire by rotation are Messrs. H. E. McGee and K. T . Addy who, being eligible, offer themselves for
 re-election.

 Charitable Donations
 Charitable donations amounted to £1,370 in the year.

 Fixed Assets
 The changes that occurred in the fixed assets during the year are set out in Note 10 to the accounts. In view of the specialised
 use of the freehold land and buildings at Hillsborough, the directors are unable to give an indication of the excess of
 the market value over book value, th e buildings will continue to be maintained to their present standard and it is not
 considered appropriate to provide depreciation on the freehold stadium.

 Auditors
 The directors will place a resolution before the annual general meeting to re-appoint Arthur Andersen & Co. as auditors
 for The ensuing year.

 The directors present their annual report on the affairs of the company, together wish the accounts and auditors' report, tor the
 year ended 31st May, 1988.
Principal A ctivity and Business Review
The principal activity of the company continues to be that of a professional football club.
A t the end of the season the team held a respectable eleventh place in the First Division. Hard woric ■was required to recover
from a weak start and this was successful in providing some exciting highlights to the year. These included reaching the quarter
final of the UtUewoods Cup and the epic confrontation with Everton in four F A - cup-ties. On 16th April we were one of the teams
invitod to tate part in the Football League Festival of Football at V/ernbSey. Winning through to the final we narrowly tost to Nottingham
Forest 1-0 on penalties.
Three of the clubs’ players: Nigel Worthington, Siggt Jansson and Tony Galvin were regtriarty called on to represent their countries
a t senior level, wtolst Mel Stertand was capped by England in a *8 International.
A t the Football Association's request we hosted an excellent F.A . Challenge Cup Semi-Final between Nottingham Forest and
Liverpool in our stadium on 9th A pril
During the last season and dose season 10 new professronals were recruited to the titutr. Cranson, Fee, Galvin. Harper, Hodgson,
M cCall, Owen. Proctor, Pearson and W est Doting the same period we said goodbye to: Brarmigan. Chapman, Chamberlain,
H azel, Hayward, Jacobs. Marwood. Morris. Owen, Shelton. Shutt. Smith. Snodin and W alker. W e offer our thanks to them for
their services to the Club and wish them well in the future.
The long term strategy (or developing the D ub's quality through th e encouragement of younger players and concentration on
comprehensive team strength is still on course. Consistent progress in sporting accomplishment and financial stability is envisaged
in the year ahead.
One sign of this success is that the Executive Club has now readied capacity and there is a waiting list of supporters anxious
to enjoy the excellent facilities.
Increased income and improved conditions for players was a factor in this year’s operating loss of £73,568. After bank interest
and d efiat in transfer fees during the same period the overall loss is £448.865.
On your behalf we take this opportunity of thanking our supporters, players, staff and stewards, and everyone connected with
the Club, for their unstinting support and effort throughout the year.

       of th e specialised nature of the stadium , th e directors fe lt it inappropriate to include the asset in the accounts at that
       fig ure. Consequently, the directors reduced the valuation to £1,000,000, fo r accounts purposes, as of that date.

Auditors5 Report to the Members
W e have audited the accounts set out on pages 3 to 10 in accordance with approved Auditing Standards.

As explained in N ote 1, the company has not com plied with Statem ent of Standard Accounting P ractice N o. 12 in that
no provision has been m ade for depreciation on th e freehold stadium .

Except fo r th e effects of not depreciating the freehold stadium as described in the preceding paragraph. In our opinion,
the accounts, which have been prepared under th e historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of freehold
tand and buildings, give a true and fair view of th e state of affaire of the com pany at 31st M ay, 1988 and of the loss and
source and application of funds for the year then ended, and comply with th e Com panies A ct 1985-

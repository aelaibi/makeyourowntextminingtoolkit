Afternoon Session
              JOHN RANDOLPH TOM BARTHOLOMEW Called

                    Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Q. You are John Randolph Tom Bartholomew, are you? - A. Yes.

Q. And you live in the Leppings Lane area of Sheffield? - A. Yes,
   that is right, sir.

Q. How long have you lived in that area? - A. 29 years.

Q. And you work at a bakery in Claywheels Lane? - A. That is
   right.

Q. Were you at work on the morning of 15th April of this year? -
   A . Yes.

Q. Did you leave your work just after 2 o'clock? - A. 7-minutes-
   past-2, to be exact.

Q. Did you walk home from there? - A. Yes.

Q. Did that take you along Claywheels Lane into Beeley Wood Road?
   - A. That is right.

Q. Where did you go to from there? - A. I got to the end of
   Beeley Wood Road and that joins up with Penistone Road North.
   I turned right there and turning right all the way to
   Leppings Lane, and then I turned left at the zebra crossing on
   Leppings Lane, turned right again and....

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Do we need to go into all this,
   Mr. Phillips?

        MR. PHILLIPS:   No.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    As I understand it this gentleman
   was with Mrs. Sweet at the relevant time.   I hope we can take
   his evidence fairly shortly.

        MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes, I am hoping to:

Q. On the journey back from work to your home did you make any
   observations of football supporters? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What did you see? - A. When I was walking down Claywheels Lane
   there were coaches parked on the edge of the roa d, and I
   noticed a not were from Birkenhead.  There were one or two
   drivers sat on the coaches.  There were no supporters on.  As
   I got to the junction of Beeley Wood Road and Claywheels Lane
   I met a group of supporters with red and white scarves on and
   "Liverpool" on the emblems, and they were discussing the
   prices of tickets.  I heard £20 mentioned.  As I was walking
   past I heard a group of youths from the Gate car park shouting
   to these across the road - I don't know if they were selling
   tickets - but there was a discussion about tickets.

                                                      J .R .T .BARTHOLOMEW


    Q. Were you asked for any tickets on your journey home? - A. Oh,
       yes, nearly all the way home from that point.

    Q. How many times? - A. I would say at least AO times.

    Q. Did you see any drinking on your way home? - A. Yes, there
       were youths carrying cans of beer and lager.  I presume it to
       be lager and beer anyhow.  They were drinking it from Beeley
       Wood Road right round to where I left Leppings Lane.

    Q. And did you see them doing anything else? - A. I saw two or
       three urinating at the side of a wall on Beeley Wood Road.
       That was on the highway.

    Q.   What time would you say you got home? - A.   Ithinkabout      20-
         past -2.

    Q. And then I think Mrs. Sweet was there already at home, was not
       she? - A . Y e s .

    Q. And you set off again? - A. Yes.

    Q. What time did you set off? - A. I 'phoned Mrs. Sweet to tell
       her I was going to be late from work, and she said, "I've just
       been looking at a lot of Police horses going past.     There must
       be 30.  She sa i d , "When we go shopping can we look at the
       horses?", and I said, "Yes, certainly".

    Q.   You went with Mrs. Sweet to see the horses, did not   you? - A.
         Yes.

    Q. Can you say what time you set off? - A. It would be about 20-
       to-3.

    Q. So you then took a route which took you into Leppings Lane? -
       A . Yes.

    Q. Did you go towards the area of the turnstiles     on Leppings
       Lane? - A . Y e s .

    Q. What were the crowds like as you went along there? - A. It was
       very heavy.  Both causeway edges going from Penistone Road
       towards the ground up Leppings Lane were packed. I would
       think 6 feet either side of the road.  There was just enough
       room to probably get a single bus up.

    Q. Did you see traffic using the road? - A. There were one or two
       cars, but they were going very slow because of the people on
       the ro a d. *

    Q. Did you have anybody at this stage asking you about tickets? -
       A. I got about 20 yards up Leppings Lane, and a big gang of
       supporters came down, probably 20 or more, asking and
       shouting, "Tickets, tickets, tickets".   I just said, "No, I
       haven't got any, I am sorry". I noticed they were carrying
       cans of beer.  Most of them were carrying cans of beer.

                                                       J . R . T .BARTHOLOMEW

    Q. Were they drinking from them? - A. Quite a lot were drinking
       from them, yes.

    Q. What were they doing with the empties? - A. Putting them down
       and kicking them like a little football.

    Q. On the road? - A. Yes.

    Q.   How would you describe the behaviour of   these people? - A. It
         was very boisterous, I would say.

    Q.   Then I think it is right you managed to get past the entrance
         to the turnstiles? - A. When we got to the junction of Vere
         Road and Leppings La ne ....

    Q. Yes, that is the road immediately before the turnstiles? - A.
       Yes.  I looked up at the crowds and Connie said to me, "Good
       God, look at that lot, John.  Y o u ’ll never see that again".
       It was just one mass of red and white colours and pink faces
       from the crowd.

    Q. Were you able to get past it? - A. I went past there to
       approximate 6 feet or so from the sweet shop.  I said,
       "Connie, we can't go no further.  We are going to get in this
       crush".  I said, "Hold my hand and we'll go across the other
       side of the road.  We will not see the horses today, duck".
       She said, "Right".  So I made an effort to turn right, and I
       had to push my way through the crowd and we were all thronged
       into the entrances.

    Q.   And you were still on Leppings Lane at this time? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Did you get over the bridge, the bridge over the River Don? -
         A. Yes.

    Q. On the other side of the road? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Did you then go to some waste ground near to the tyre depot? -
         A. When I crossed Leppings Lane, I looked across at the
         entrances and it was just one solid mass of people.    I said,
         "Come on, we're not stopping here".    So we walked up the full
         length of the bridge and I turned round again and looked, and
         it was a sight for sore eyes.    It was a mass of people and
         they were spreading probably halfway into Leppings Lane at
         that time.

    Q. Did you get to the vantage point you had selected on this
       waste ground? - A. Not at that time.  I climbed over a little
       wall which was about 2 feet high and climbed up a hill, which
       was probably 12 or 15 feet above the road level.

    Q. What time was this when you were there? - A. About 10-minutes
       to-3.

    Q. Did you see any Police vehicles? - A. I passed a Landrover
       opposite the sweet shop, and the front end of the Landrover
       was just slightly, not pointing to the middle of the
                           59

                                                 J .R ■T .BARTHOLOMEW


     entrances but just slightly to the right.  Beyond that I think
     there were three, possibly four, Policemen on horses.

Q. When you say beyond that, you mean in the entrance itself to
   Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you hear anything from the Landrover? - A. Not at that
   point I did n o t , but when I got on to the vantage point I
   heard an announcement.

Q. Can you say what it was? - A. It said, "This is a message" - I
   don't know whether he used "urgent" at that time, "This is an
   urgent message to the Liverpool supporters. Would you please
   stop pushing forward.  The people at the turnstiles are being
   crushed".

Q. Did you heard that message or a similar one subsequently? - A.
   Yes, he repeated that once or twice in less than a minute.

Q. Did you hear any messages from any other source than the
   Landrover? - A. I did not hear anything else, no.

Q. You saw, I think, the crowd of people at the front of the
   turnstiles clearly from where you were? - A. I had a
   grandstand view as you might say.

Q. Could you see the Police horses? - A. Quite clearly, yes.

Q. Could you see how many there were? - A. I think there were
   four to start with, and as I was watching I saw a white horse
   come from the direction of Middlewood Road.  When he got
   opposite us I saw a Police Officer on a horse went like that
   to him, beckoning him over.  That was a white horse that
   came down there.  At the same time there was a white horse
   and a brown coming from the direction of up the side of the
   river from the main entrance to the Wednesday ground.

Q.   Were you able to see the gates, the large gates? - A. Oh,    yes.

Q.   On either side? - A. yes.

Q.   Gate A and gate C? - A. I could see two full gates onmy right
     and my left there is the gate on the side of the sweet shop.
     I could only see half of that because a brick building was
     obstructing my view.

Q. Did you see either of those gates opening? - A. First of all I
   saw the gate on the extreme lef t ....

Q. The one by the sweet shop? - A. Yes, it was being pulled like
   that, pulled and pushed, pulled and pushed, in the proper
   manner which it should open.   Then it stopped.  Then a little
   bit after, probably half-a-minute, it started going that way
   against the movement of the normal run as though it was being
   pushed, and then that stopped.   All the time this was
   happening the Police in the Landrover was asking the fans not
   to shove forward.  The Police on the horses, they were in the
                             60


                                                        J .R .T .BARTHOLOMEW


     crowd, and they kept pointing to different individuals, really
     applying their law, saying to them strictly as though somebody
     was doing something wrong.  I don't know what they were doing.

Q.   Did you see the gate open eventually?       - A.   I saw the gate   on
     the right o p e n , y e s .

Q.    The gate on the right. That   is gate C.    - A. The gate nearest
     the river, yes.

Q. At the time when gate C opened were the outer perimeter gates
   opened or closed? - A. I think they were open.

Q.    Did you see any Police on horseback at that point by  the outer
     perimeter gates? - A. Oh, yes, there were four, possibly five
     horses, and they seemed to form a semicircle across the
     entrance.   It was my impression somebody gave them an order
     to try and seal the entrance of.

Q.   Was that effective? - A. It was for a short time.

Q.    When you say it was for a short time, I am talking about the
     time when gate C opened. - A. This was just before that.

Q. Just before that they formed this semicircle.      When gate C
   was opened was there then a space on the further side of the
   horses? Did the crowd thin or stay the same? - A. I thought
   the people were trying to get underneath the horses to get
   past, like a blockade.  Then I heard an announcement saying,
   "Would people please move by the horses", or something like
   that, or form a queue at the side of the horses.      I know it
   mentioned the horses.  I said to Connie, "If somebody
   doesn't do something soon somebody is going to get killed
   outside there because nobody is going anywhere". There were
   people at the side of the wall like t h i s , they were just
   crushed at the side of the wall, at the side of the
   turnstile.  It seemed ages.

.Q. Did the horses then move out of the way? - A. No, they were
    still there.  Then I saw a mounted Police walk through the
    crowd very slowly, and he positioned his horse about 10 feet
    from the turnstile wall and I said to Connie, "He’s trying to
    take pressure off those at the front because they are going to
    be killed if they something is not done".

Q.   Did the          crow d ,    in fact, go t h r o u g h           the    gate      that   you    saw
     opened?            A.        The g a t e ?

Q.   Yes, the big               gate.       A.       Yes,      they    went     through       like    a

                            Cross-examined             by MR.      WOODWARD:

        Q.   And t ha t was s o me t i m e b e f o r e the g a m e b e g a n ?             A.     We

Now the next thing is this:  some minutes into the game
you saw a sudden surge or wave? - A. It was like a wave
behind the crowd.

Behind the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

Had you seen any such surge before? - A. No.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Do you mean that day or ever?

      MR. HYTNER: I mean that day? - A. As I say that day,
no, I had not seen anything.

Of course you were looking straight over there and you would
have seen if there had been? - A. Yes.

I don't know whether you can remember this: was that surge
coincidentalwith Peter Beardsley hitting the cross bar at
your end? - A. That is when it happened when Beardsley hit
the bar, yes.

     MR. HYTNER:     Yes, thank you.


              Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Miss Watson, a completely different matter.  I hope this is
not going to embarrass you, but where on earth were you
able to get four tickets for this match the very day before?
- A. I did not get four, I got two. My friends had two.

Where did you get them from? - A. Prom a friend of a friend
who works at the ground.

Were there other tickets available for friends of friends
on the Friday before? - A. I would not know about that.   I
got to know on the Friday there was some tickets if I wanted
them.

If necessary could you help us a little more as to the exact
source.  I am not asking you to do for the moment but it
may be at a later stage when we come to allocation of tickets
that some people will be concerned as to how there were
tickets available for this match just 24 hours before? -
A. Yes.

      MR. JACKSON:    Thank you.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

One matter only, sir.  This surge that you described when
Peter Beardsley nearly scored, was that in Pens 3 and 4?
- A. Yes, because there is fences down either side.

                                              J. WATSON


      Q. That is right, but you observed a wave or a movement in the
         crowd coincidental with that attack on the goal at your end?
         - A. Yes.

                 MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.


                              DUNCAN STURROCK Called
                            Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

      Q.   Are you Duncan Sturrock? - A. I am,   yes.

      Q.    And   you are a bus driver, are       you, for South Yorkshire
           Transport? - A. Correct.

      Q. You live in a road just off Middlewood Road.      Is that right?
         - A. I do, yes.

      Q.   And    you   were on duty on the 15th ofApril this year? - A. Yes.

      Q.   Did that mean that you had to leave to get to work for
           9 o'clock? - A. It was nearer half-past-8 I was due to start
           that morning.

      Q. Did youwalk from your house to the bus depot? - A. Yes, that
         is how I normally get to work.  It is only 15, 20 minutes
         walk.

      Q. Is the bus depot on Herries Road? - A. Yes, it is on the
         junction of Leppings Lane and Halifax Road.

      Q. So you have to go from Middlewood Road down to that junction,
         that roundabout? - A. Yes, down Middlewood Road, Catchbar
         Lane and then down Leppings Lane.

      Q. What time did you leave home in the morning? - A. That
         morning it would be 10-past-8, quarter-past-8.

      Q. Did you see any supporters or apparent supporters on your
         route from your home to the bus depot? - A. As I was
         walking to work I saw three hire vans, mini buses at three
         separate locations on the route.

      Q. Did you notice anything about the contents of these vans?
         - a . In all of the vans there were 12-15 football fans,
         Liverpool supporters.     In the first van I came across which
         was parked outside the training ground on Middlewood Road
         t h e ^ is a wide grass verge, it was parked on there, I
         noticed there was quite a large number of cans of beer
         stacked up in the back of the seats.     They had got cushions
         and coats on top of them.

      Q. Was anybody drinking at that time in the morning? - A. All
         the three vans that I went past there were youths, late
         teens, early 2 0 's outside and most of them were drinking.
                                  D. STURROCK


One of them you say was stacked with tins of drink? - A.
There were trays of beer down one side.

Did you speak to any of the people that were concerned with
these vans on your way to work? - A. At one of the vans I
was approached by a couple of the lads that were there and
asked if I had got any tickets for the match.

I don't think you had, had you? - A. No.

And you went on to work? - A. I went on to work, yes.

You then started driving your bus in the City.   Do you
remember in the course of the morning some lads getting
on to your bus, two lads 7 - A. Yes, later on that morning
I was in the City Centre waiting for my departure time to come
out to Hillsborough again. As I was waiting a couple of
Liverpool supporters got on to my bus, got on to the plat­
form and asked me if I had got any spare tickets or if I
knew anybody that could get them some tickets.

And did this happen again during the day? - A. It happened
again when I got up to the Middlewood terminus and again as
1 was approaching Catchbar Lane, the bus stop at the junction
of Catchbar Lane and Middlewood Road.

And the route that you were driving on took you from the
City Centre out through the Hillsborough area to Wisewood,
didn't it? - A. Well I was on two routes that day, one
to Wisewood and one to Middlewood.

At about half-past-1 did you have to make a run through
Hillsborough towards Wisewood? - A. That is right, yes.

Did that mean driving along Langsett Road which of course
is the continuation of Middlewood Road into the City Centre?
- a . That is right, it leads into the City Centre.

Did you pay any particular attention to what you saw
en route? - A. At this time it would be between 1 and
2 o'clock.  I cannot remember the exact time at the moment.
Most of the pubs that I went past that day, it was a sunny
day, sunny afternoon, there were large groups of people
standing outside the pubs drinking.

Was it a usual thing for a Saturday? - A. I have only ever
noticed it once before and it was oh probably two or three
years ago.  There was another big match on and a similar
incident occurred.

Now you got to your terminus at Wisewood about what
2 o'clock time, just after 2 o'clock? - A. Round about
2, yes.

Then did you have to come back along the same route? - A.
Yes, I came back towards the City Centre.
                                    D. STURROCK


So what time were you travelling in the area of the ground
then on the way back? - A. On that route the closest I
go to the City Centre is the Shopping Centre at Hillsborough

Did you again notice anything in particular about public
houses on your way back? - A. Yes, there was still crowds
outside the public houses or most of the public houses.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What time is that? - A. This
would be going on for 2 o'clock.

       MR. PHILLIPS:  Did you see any Police Officers about?
- a . When I got towards the City Centre, probably half-a-
mile from the City Centre, I noticed .... Oh, you mean in
the Hillsborough area?

Yes. - A. Yes, sorry, there were quite a lot of Police about
two-man foot patrols, special Constables, dog vans, that
sort of thing.

Did you see any Police involved with any public houses? -
A. There were groups of Police perhaps four or five police
outside most of the pubs I passed, yes.

       MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes, thank you very much.


              Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

One matter, Mr. Sturrock.  You told the Inquiry about
seeing these vehicles parked very early in the morning as
you were on your way to work with men around them drinking?
- A. Yes.

And you looked inside and saw quantities of beer.   You have
not told the Inquiry what the quantities were.   Did you see
those that you could see were in large trays? - A. Yes,
there was only one van that I saw a large quantity of beer
in.  There was beer stacked four cans high.    It looked -
I only got a quick glimpse - but it looked as though the
full length of the van, probably 10' probably.

In your statement I think you made an estimate of that,
400 or 500 cans of beer? - A. Yes, I was assuming that
there were 24 tins to a tray.

That is how they looked to you? - A. Yes, certainly a large
quantity.

And the occupants of the vehicle would be about 12 or 15
people? - A. Round about that number, yes.

       MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very much, that is
all.

                         SUSAN DAWES Called
                      Examined by MR. GOLDSACK;

Q. Mrs. Susan Dawes? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you live in the vicinity of the Hillsborough ground?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And as such you are used to seeing the build up of crowds
   on match days? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you at hoiae on the 15th of April? - A. Yes, I was.

Q.    And did you see people arriving from mid-morning onwards?
     - A. Yes, from about 10, 10.30 onwards.

Q. I think your impression was that a number of people were
   drinking but you did not see any disorderly behaviour? -
   A. No, they were just drinking out of cans.

Q.   What I would like you to deal with Mrs. Dawes is this:  as
     a local resident what impression did you form about the
     number of Police Officers in the Leppings Lane area on this
     particular day? - A. There were very few to what there
     normally is for a semi-final.

Q. Were you in the area last year when the same match was
   played? - A. Yes.

Q. How did the numbers compare with last year so far as you
   were concerned? - A. There was a lot last year. We usually
   have the road lined on both sides and then Police Officers
   walking about mingling with the crowd as well.

Q.   That is in Leppings Lane itself, is it? - A. Yes.

Q.    Can you give us some idea of the number of Police that there
     appeared to be in Leppings Lane this year? - A. Yes, on the
     barriers that they section the side roads off with there
     was about three Policemen on each which is normal anyway
     and then there were about, I would say, between four or
     five Police on horses, mounted Police, and probably about
     half-a-dozen Police just milling about up and down the road.
     That is all.  Nobody actually stood at the gates or anything.
     We normally have them lined from the ground right down to
     the roundabout at the bottom but there was none of this that
     particular day.  I did comment to my husband earlier in the
     morning about this.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Just one moment.  When you said
     "gates", "none at the gates" you said. Which gates are you
     talking about? - A. I mean from the gates of the ground
     down to the roundabout at the bottom the Police normally
     line it on both sides and stand probably one at each house,
     which we did not get this year, there was nobody there.

                                        S. DAWES


Q*         MR. GOLDSACK:  What you have described about a
     Policeman per house, is that what you have seen on previous
     Cup Tie occasions? - A. Yes.

Q. What about normal league games? - A. Normal league matches
   you will just get the Policemen there on the barriers on
   the roads and you will get quite a few numbers of Police
   just walking about mingling with the crowd and stop if any­
   body is singing or there if there is a gangcoming down they
   will disperse them very quickly.

Q. How did the number of Policemen in Leppings Lane on the
   15th of April compare with a normal league match? - A.
   There weren't as many.

           MR. GOLDSACK:   Thank you very much.

           MR. HYTNER:  Sir, I have no questions but since
     Mrs. Dawes may be the last of the local residents, may I
     just say this on behalf of those I represent, that in the
     hundreds of statements that have been taken by my instructing
     solicitors, the overwhelming majority pay great tribute and
     express great gratitude to the local residents round Leppings
     Lane for inviting them into their homes to enable them to
     'phone home after the match and I really felt that ought to
     be said although it may not directly affect Mrs. Dawes.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well if I can add to that,
     Mr. Hytner, I have come across the same comments in the
     hundreds of letters that I have read too.  Yes, thank you.

           MR. JACKSON:   Sir, likewise may I adopt my learned
     friend's observations and thank, through Mrs. Dawes, the
     local residents.   I have no questions.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mrs. Dawes, may I ask you about your description of the
   Police presence on other occasions.  When you speak of
   "Police being about" what sort of matches are you describing,
   what sort of occasions? - A. Usually for semi-finals there
   is usually a strong Police presence.  For the last two
   Wednesday matches we have had quite a strong Police presence
   as well since the tragedy happened but we do get a few
   Police at normal matches if they are expecting quite a
   few coming.




                                  /Q. When you say
                          74
                                              S. DAWES




Q. When you say that there seemed to be less Police about this
   year, what time are you speaking of, what time of the day?
      A. Right through, because they are usually there from I
   would say about ten o'clock.  We usually get quite a number
   of Police.  Before the fans arrive really.

Q. So you are talking about from early to middle morning right
   through?  - A. Right through to three o'clock.

Q. But there were Police stationed at the ends of the
   crossroads, Vere Road and the other roads and the barriers.
      A. Yes, three on each to stop them going down the roads.

Q. So on every road junction along there there were Police in
   19 89, and that is the sort of situation that has been
   practised on other occasions?   - A. Yes.

Q. In 1988 for example.  You say there were other Police
   though lining the road.  - A. Yes.   They usually stand
   down the road in case there is any trouble.

Q.    Where do you say these Officers stand?  - A. On the
     outside.  We have got little forecourts and then there is
     the main road, Leppings Lane, and they stand on the road,
     on the pavements.

Q. They stand on the road ....    -   A. Well on the pavement.

Q ..... facing the houses do they?  - A. No facing the road,
    watching the fans coming down the road.

Q.   So they stand on the kerb edge facing the    road? -   A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that on both sides of the road?   -   A. Yes.

Q. At every house?  - A.   Well spaced out, yes, there is
   practically one to every house I would say normally.

Q. You see I suggest you may be mistaken about that, that it
   hasn't been the practice to have men posted in the sort of
   positions you describe all along Leppings Lane.
   A.  That is what it usually appears because there are so
   many Police normally.

Q.   Of course in 1989, is this a fair impression, there    seemed
     to be an awful lot more people about?  - A. Fans?      No,
     same as last year I would have thought.

Q.   So your impression of the fans, and of the build-up of the
     fans, and their attendance at the ground was no different
     from what you have experienced in 1988? - A. No.     It was
     just a constant, steady stream right through.

All the time? - A. Until probably about half two then
when it got to quarter to three the late-comers came, but
by that time it was very built up outside the ground.

How far away from the ground is your house?    -   A. Half way
down the road.

Going up towards the Penistone Road roundabout?  - A.
Before it turns down on to Penistone Road I'm on the
corner.

Of course there have been occasions when Policemen have
come and been posted at yards to keep out supporters who
were going in there to make a nuisance of themselves.
A. Y e s .

You are aware of that happening?  -   A. We've never had any
trouble but yes I would imagine so.   You feel safer when
there are Police about, definitely.

But is this your recollection, that in the past on
occasions when people have been making nuisances of
themselves, particular yards or particular spots, Police­
men have come and stood there? - A. Yes I would think so.

That wouldn't be necessary would it if there had been a
line of Policemen already along the road?  - A. I don't
know because I've never had any trouble so I've never had
to send for anyone to come.

Between half past two and three o'clock did you notice the
build up of the fans coming along the road?  - A. No it
had died off a little bit, and then about quarter to three
the ones came down that were quite high spirited and they
probably had been drinking.

So your recollection of this day in 1989 is from about half
past two in fact a falling off, a decreasing of the throng
of people coining along the road.  - A. I would think not
so many as there had been earlier.

Quite noticeable in your experience was it?    -   A. Yes.

And then something happened at about quarter to three?
A. Quarter to three you got the late ones coming down which
is normal anyway.  They did that last year.

And at quarter to three there was a build up of people?
A. No not really.  I would say about fifty or so fans came
down Leppings Lane singing.

Just walking along?   -   A. No they ran, most of them ran
down.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What was that?       -     A. Most of
them ran down the road singing.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Just running along?     -       A. Yes.

Do you recall shortly before three o'clock quite a con­
siderable number of fans coming along the road as though a
train had arrived?   - A. No.

You don't recall that? - A. No.     I came away from the
window about five to three and they were getting quite het
up then outside the ground.  They were all trying to get
in.

Can you see the ground from your window?     -   A. Y e s .

So you are able to help us, are you, as to the state of the
ground at the gates, between half past two and quarter to
three? - A. There were quite a number queueing up to get
inside but it was quite orderly.  It was later on when they
started to get a bit disruptive.

So your recollection is between half past two and quarter
to three the crowd that you could see from your window at
the Leppings Lane entrance seemed to be queueing up and to
be quite orderly?  - A. Not orderly but in just a mass.
Not a queue but they were just stood there trying to get
in.

You see "queueing up" was your phrase.  Do you mean just
going there or what?  - A. No, just stood there waiting to
go in.  They didn't seem to be getting anywhere and that
has not happened.  The year before by that time usually
most of the people had got through because they tend to
make them queue up and go through the turnstiles.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Tend to make them queue up at
what?   - A. To go through the turnstiles.  There is not
usually a big mass of people, not as many as that.

     MR. WOODWARD:   In the years before when you have seen
that happening and the fans queueing up and not in a big
mass how have they been queueing?  Has something caused
them to queue or have they just done it? - A. Well there
is usually quite a few Policemen mingling in with them,
what I've seen before.

What have you seen the Policemen doing that were mingling
in? - A. Just keeping people in order, calming them down.

Individual Policemen saying to people, "Move along. Stand
clear".  - A. I don't know because I don't go and stand

         there.  I don't know what they say to people, I don't go
         and stand there.

    Q. What did you observe happening?         -   A. This time I just saw
       the mounted Police.

    Q.   But in the past what have you observed happening?      A. A
         strong Police presence that tends to keep the fans calm.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you say "keep them calm",
         just looking at it from where you were this year you say
         there was a mass, just a mass.  - A. Yes.   There didn't
         seem to be any organisation at all.

    Q. Had there on previous occasions that you had seen been a
       mass or actual queues or what?   - A. Not actual queues but
       they did n't seem as dense and as tightly packed as they did
       this year.   There's not normally so many trying to get in
       at once at that time of the day.

    Q.   There was a larger number trying to get in at once this
         time, is that it? - A. There did seem to be at that time
         yes.

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   And in the past the same numbers have
         gone into the ground probably, if it has been a capacity
         ground, but they have gone in  ....  - A. More orderly.

    Q ..... in a steady flow.    -   A. Yes.

    Q. They have managed to get along the streets.  They have got
       through the bottleneck as it has been described, and they
       have not been marshalled and directed by Policemen.  There
       have been Policemen around and those fans have made their
       way in an ordinary controlled supporting manner to go to
       the turnstiles.  - A. Yes.

    Q. Is that right? That is the impression.   There weren't
       Policemen marching them, thrusting them, shepherding them
       like sheep.  - A. Not on semi-final days.   That only
       happens on ordinary match days .

    Q. Could you say that again?  - A. That doesn't happen on
       semi-final days  because they can't march everybody down
       together to get them in the ground.

    Q. On the semi-finals that you have seen in the past when it
       has been a sell-out at the ground, the same crowd, the
       crowds have arrived, they have gone in and they haven't
       been so numerous, so thick and dense as they were on this
       year at the sort of time you described.  - A. No because
       they have normally all got through.  They just didn't seem
       to be going anywhere on that particular day.

                                             S. DAWES




Something had gone wrong then.    -    A. Yes.

And there were supporters coming along in considerable
numbers after about two forty five in 1989 weren't there?
   A. Yes.  About quarter to three, but that is normal,
that is what happened the year before as well.

What was different then about quarter to three this year
compared with last year?  - A. Because last year the Police
calmed them down before they got as far as the gates and
this year there was nobody to stop them running down the
road and joining into the mass at the bottom.

So this year they were running down the road into the mass
at the bottom.  - A. Yes, singing, and they couldn't get
in because everybody else was still trying to get in, and
as a rule everyone else would have gone in and they get
them in fairly quickly then, the Police.

Do you mean this is the picture, that they were coming down
the road rushing and running?  - A. Running and singing,
very high spirited.

Just piling into the gateway?  - A. They joined on to the
end of the gateway.  They were quiet at first once they got
there but when it got to five to three everybody seemed to
want to get in to see the match and they started pushing
and shoving and nobody was getting in.

Did you   see the Police landrover there?    -   A. No.

Did you   see the mounted Policemen?    -   A. Yes.

Did you   see the mounted Policemen endeavouring to hold back
those who were wanting to join the crowd?    - A. I saw a
few start to make them get down off gates and things that
were trying to climb on the gates.    There were about three
mounted Police together in the corner.

Did you see fans trying to get through the closed barrier
gates at one stage, pushing and trying to get through?
A. I can't see those, but do you mean the concertina gates?

No, the outer railings.    -   A. The blue railings?

Yes   - A. At the corner near the shop I did see about
half a dozen fans trying to climb over there.

They were closed at one stage weren't they?       -     A. Yes,
they looked as though they were.

And even then the fans were intent on getting beyond them.

   A. Yes, trying to climb over and the Police made them
get down.  I would say that was about ten to three time.

                   ALBERT LINDLEY called

                 Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Are you Albert Lindley?    -   A. Yes.

Do you live in the Leppings Lane area of Sheffield?
A. Yes.

I think you have lived there for some fifty one years, is
that so? - A. That is right.

You are quite used to supporters going by to football
matches?  - A. Yes.

I think you are in charge of a set of garages?    -     A. Yes
on Leppings Lane.

About how many garages, twenty?  Twenty seven?  - A. I
have a picture of them here if you would like to look at
it.

Perhaps we can just see that if we can have it passed to
us.  (Produced) - A. There are twenty seven garages
altogether.

On this day did you go to where those garages are?       -   A.
Yes I was on the site from about twelve o'clock.

Why did you go there?  - A. Well the main reason is to keep
the fans off from urinating on the garages.   Also we get
quite a number of cars parking down and they just park
anywhere in front of a garage door or anywhere.

Did you have that sort oftrouble this year? -     A. No. We
just had three cars and I asked them to move off and they
moved off.

Did you have any trouble with fans urinating near the
garages this year?     A. I just left the garage site for
about ten minutes or so and my wife said there had been
about ten down.

I think you noticed how people were coming along Leppings
Lane didn't you from where you were.  - A. Yes.

Was there a time when you went back into your house? - A.
There was just that few minutes when I went back into the
house for a cuppa, and the wife said - she stayed on the
site - she said there had been about ten people down.

Q. Towards kick-off time, towards three o'clock, did you
   notice anything particular happening outside in Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes it seemed to go a little quiet just
   before three o ’clock, and then I would estimate it was
   three o'clock we heard the roar of the crowd.   From where
   we live we can hear this cheer and roar and we can estimate
   that it was the players coming out of the tunnel.   From
   where we are we can hear these cheers and we can tell
   whether it is a goal, a near miss or anything like that,
   but we did estimate that the players had come out of the
   tunnel, these cheers.

                                                 A. LINDLEY


Q. And did you notice anything happening in Leppings Lane when
   this happened? - A. Yes, a few seconds after the cheers there
   was a huge mass of people running from Wadsley Bridge area,
   all running along the lane, all eager to get in.  They were
   all anxious to get in, running as fast as they could, and
   quite a large number.

Q. How many would you say? Could you guess? - A. At that time,
   may be a bit of exaggeration, but I estimated about 1,000.

Q. Is this the picture then.  You had people coming along
   Leppings Lane, and then it tailed off a bit, and then there
   was this sudden extra lot? - A. They heard this roar from the
   ground, so everybody sort of set off and eager to get in.

Q. So is this a fair picture, a lull and then a sudden rush
   towards the end? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you look out of the house or go out of the house when this
   happened? - A. I was on the garage site when it happened.

Q. Were you able to see where the Police Officers had been who
   were manning the barriers between Leppings Lane and the side
   roads? - A. I could see the two who were stood at the bottom
   of Eskdale Road.   That is just opposite the garage site.
   When this happened, all these people ran down towards the
   ground, I walked across the road to see what was happening,
   and I saw a large mass of people already outside the ground,
   and then all this lot joined them.

Q. Did you see what happened to those Police Officers at the end
   of Eskdale Road? - A. Yes, I believe they may have been used
   to this kind of thing, and at 3 o'clock they usually just pack
   up and make their way back either to the ground or to the
   depot.

Q. Did they do that on this particular day at that time? - A. We
   looked round and we d i d n ’t notice the Police were stood there
   at all.  We watched the crowd, and they had almost finished
   running pa s t, and when we looked across at Eskdale Road there
   were no Police there then.

Q. So they had left then? - A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Lindley, I am not sure that you said this, but the
   description of the crowd that was coming along at that late
   time, about 2.55, was it rather like a train having arrived? -
   A. It was, yes, just as though a trainload had just come in,
   or otherwise as the Police usually did, they kept the
   supporters somewhere up Wadsley Bridge ;until they got quite a
   crowd, and then they let them g o .

Q. You had the impression of a sudden crowd, not just a few
   coming along who were late and on their own, but a great surge
   coming along? - A. Yes.

Q. Like a train, going along Leppings Lane, straight towards the
   entrance? - A. Just as though they had come from the train.

Q. Thank you. - A. There is also a strip of land behind ray
   garages which is just grass.  We used to keep it flowered, but
   now it is just grass because the fans come along and empty
   beer cans, sling them over the wire netting.  I filled a
   bin bag full of empty cans, bottles, chip and fish papers
   and all sorts.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you very much.      That is all.

                      Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Q.   Mr. Brown, although as we can see in fact you are a member of
     the South Yorkshire Police, I think you are also a resident
     near to the Hillsborough ground? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.   You live in fact on Bickerton Road? - A. Yes.

Q. And on 15th April you were off duty, and so at home for the
   most part of the day? - A. Yes.

Q. What I would like to ask you about is a trip you made about
   lunchtime to the shopping area at Hillsborough, which I think
   meant you went up Leppings Lane and through the Hillsborough
   Park area and Middlewood Road? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. What sort of time was that? - A. I set off approximately 1
   o 'clock.

Q. And what time did you get back? - A. Probably round about
   2.15, 2.20.

Q.   So an hour-plus altogether? - A. Yes.

Q.   As you went past the entrance to the ground shortly after 1
     o'clock, were there many spectators around? - A. Yes, quite a
     few hundred.

Q. Liverpool supporters? - A. Mainly, yes.

Q. Did you see much evidence of drink? - A. Quite a lot.

Q. Can you give any idea of the proportion who seemed to be
   drinking? - A. I would say the majority were drinking.

Q.   What sort of ages? - A. Mostly young.    A few middle     aged, but
     mostly young-middle aged.

Q. As you made your way towards the shops and back did you see
   any signs of what you regarded as disorderly behaviour? - A .
   y e s , definitely.

            Q. Just the odd incident or not? - A. That was the only incident
               I saw.

            Q. What was it you did see? - A. There was a group of about 8
               Liverpool supporters near to Dykes Lane, shouting swearing,
               generally what would be considered a drunk and disorderly
               offence.

            Q. And what sort of time would that be? - A. Roughly between
               half-past-1 and quarter-to-2.

            Q. I think later that day you in fact went out to assist a
               colleague because you sensed there might be trouble after the
               incident? - A. Yes.

            Q. And I think subsequently you had one of the more harrowing
               tasks of the whole Inquiry? - A. Yes.

               (No questions)

                    MR. COLLINS:   Sir, we have got through the list of
               witnesses rather more quickly than was anticipated.  I am not
               sure if Chief Superintendent Mole is actually here yet.  If he
               is not he is on his way.  If he is not quite yet here I ask
               now, and I don't get any response, perhaps I could ask for a
               minute or two while he arrives?

                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Certainly.    We will take a break.

                    MR. COLLINS:   He will be the next witness.

                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Collins, I don't think there
               is any need to put those photographs in.  Just for anybody's
               information.  I think they were marked as being photographs
               taken at a match in 1987, so they are not directly relevant.

                                   (Short Adjournment)

                    MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, before my learned friend calls Mr.
               Mole to give evidence, may I make a point and ask for some
               assistance, please.  We have proceeded with some pace to date,
               and that has been secured by the endeavours of many people who
               have worked many, many hours since this Inquiry began.  We are
               now proceeding into the Police evidence.  The first witness,
               it is to be noted, is a witness who does not even appear on
               today's list.  That is a mark of the expedition which has been
               procured.  Sir, may we ask, however, for the future the pace
               be watched rather carefully lest it prejudices the fair
               investigation and consideration of matters, because insofar
               for example as there may be points to be made against
               individual Officers it would be appropriate in our submission
               that those Officers should have notice of those points
               specifically, and the opportunity should be given to them
               before they give evidence for them to have their minds
               put at rest or to have those matters considered.

                    Sir, to facilitate that and to endeavour for those who
                      84
                                         DISCUSSION




have to do it to give sensible and coherent direction and
control, would it be possible to have some order and
indication, not simply day to day from about half-past-5
for the next day, but an indication of what witnesses are
likely to be called some two or three days in advance.
It is appreciated, sir, that may have to be a sort of
rolling list because we may proceed more quickly or more
slowly from day to day, but we fear unless that is done
there may be prejudice and there certainly will be
difficulty and there may be problems in the smooth
flowing of this Inquiry.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.  Mr. Woodward, I of course
appreciate all you have said, not least the immense amount of
work and goodwill that has gone in to making the progress we
have.   I hope that nothing I have said or done has suggested
that I am trying to rattle this Inquiry along faster than it
ought to do, but obviously one wants to make as much
progress as quickly as one can.   I am perfectly prepared to
leave it to counsel to judge the pace at which it goes,
unless I feel strongly that it is either going too fast or
too slow. Either of those I would intervene on.   Up to now I
have felt we have not in any way stretched it by proceeding
at the pace we have.   I accept when we get into the details
of orders that were given and inter-relation between
Officers in the same Force we will have to look at it in a
little more detail, and it is bound to take a little longer.
But I am sympathetic to your suggestion as far as it can be
complied with.   It is really a matter for you and Mr.
Collins to liaise about this. I think you know and I think I
know the general order in which he wishes to proceed in
going through the Police evidence, and no doubt you can be
given an indication of which witnesses it is intended to
call and roughly in what order.

     As far as specific points of criticism, if there are any,
are concerned, this is not a civil case in which every
allegation has to be pleaded.  The general nature I think of
the expected points of possible criticism has already been
indicated in letters which have been written by Counsel for
the Inquiry.  Insofar as it is possible to be more specific at
any stage no doubt that can be done between counsel, and if in
the last resort something crops up during the course of the
evidence of a witness, or indeed after he has finished, which
makes it desirable he should be recalled to have an
opportunity of dealing with it, that will be done.  That is, I
hope, the best way we can proceed.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you, sir.  I was aware of the
recommendations of the Royal Commission at one stage some time
ago.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes.  Of course, this is not
strictly a 1921 Act Tribunal, but nevertheless we have tried
to approach the matter in the same way as a matter of
fairness.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, it may be right whenever any Inquiry
takes place it has to take place according to all the
circumstances, and that demands some flexibility, but if a
witness is to be called against whom allegations are likely to
be made, then in all fairness we would submit it is fair to
him at least to have some notice and the opportunity to
consider it.  Thank you, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think really to a large extent
the evidence we have had in the first week has probably to
counsel of your experience indicated the likely areas of
criticism.

     MR. WOODWARD:   But, sir, our anticipation may be right,
it may be misconstrued, it may be wrong-headed.  To know
particularly is the point, rather than to just guess.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   So be it.

     MR. COLLINS:   If it helps, I am sympathetic to the
request by Mr. Woodward.   All I can say is I will do my best
to comply with it.  On the whole the allegations are covered
by the general allegations in the Salmon letter that has
already been sent.  It is only if there is something specific
against a particular Officer that I will give formal
notification in wring.   I have already told my learned friend
I have done that exercise, and he will receive specific
matters in relation to Chief Superintendent Duckinfield.   At
the moment I have not done it in respect of any other Officer,
but since Mr. Duckinfield is intended to be either next or
next but one and will probably take a considerable time, he
may have a slight breathing space.   But I will do the best I
can.

     MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, we are grateful for that.   Sir, it
is not the good intentions that concern us, and the bona fides
is understood to be there, but for example today we know that
Mr. Duckinfield is going to be called tomorrow, and we have
not yet received the particular details, apart from the
generality which has been identified, concerning him.    I make
the point.  I don't seek to debate and argue it.    It does and
may cause difficulty.

     MR. COLLINS:   Chief Superintendent Mole, please.

                                   B.L. MOLE


There are two aspects to segregation, aren't there.   There
is the segregation in the ground itself? - A. That is
correct, sir.

Which of course is achieved simply by allocating parts of
the ground to one and parts of the ground to another team
of supporters? - A. Yes, and that is extended in some ways,
as on this occasion, which we had what I would call sterile
areas which were allocated to the F.A. and Club Officials
which in real terms were a section of seats at the end of
the North Stand adjacent to the Kop and to maintain
impartiality in that locality and a section of seats at the
South Stand adjacent to the Leppings Lane terraces which
again formed a natural barrier of segregation by neutral
supporters.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Buffers really? - A. Yes,
buffers.

      MR. COLLINS:  That is the internal segregation.   The
other sort of segregation is trying to avoid confrontation
between fans outside the ground? - A. That is correct, sir,
and the ability to direct and accommodate fans from the
various areas whether it be coaches, mini buses or trains
so that when after the match you can direct them in a
positive direction to one area of the City as opposed to
it being spread on both sides of the stadium and causing
conflict when they pass between each other as it were.

Basically there are two ways by which visitng fans can come.
One is by road and the other is by rail? - A. Basically sir,
yes.

I don't think there are any other sensible routes when
they come from a distance.

      So far as rail is concerned that can be dealt with
and normally is dealt with by convoys or by policing rather
from whatever Station they come, be it Midland or Wadsley
Bridge? - A. That is correct, sir.  I would say at this
juncture that trains are particularly welcome because you
can police them and control those supporters that are
coming.  We have the facility at Wadsley Bridge Station
which was funded by the Football Trust specially for football
and that is all it is used for, which gives us the ability
to transport supporters into that station and take them
on foot direct to the ground.

      The other facility, the Midland Station, which is in
the south of the City and as on this occasion accommodated
the Nottingham fans.  There are of course those fans who
would come in from Liverpool who would come in there and
we had to make a contingency for that and we took them
to Leppings Lane and off-loaded them at that side of the
stadium.

             Q. So far as those arriving by train are concerned, of course
                that is not material in deciding which end they should go
                to because you can make arrangements to get from whichever
                station you choose to the appropriate end? - A. No, it is
                a consideration but it is not material.  The ends' decision
                is really on the road people that are coming by road.

             Q. Exactly.   Now it is fair to say, I think, that British Rail
                has lost out on carrying football supporters and more and
                more tend to go by road rather than rail? - A. I think that
                is a fact.   There has been a tendency for that which in fact
                in my view has hampered Police operations to some extent
                because I lose control in a loose sense of those supporters,
                because when I know they are coming by train I can escort
                them positively to the stadium and make sure they enter the
                stadium directly and I know that last year we had I believe
                three special trains into Wadsley and only one this year,
                which in fact in real terms meant I had 1200 fans less coming
                by train that I knew about than this year.

             Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Are you able to express a view
                  as to what the reason for that is? Is it simply more
                  convenient to come by car or is it the drink factor? - A.
                  Well I would venture to suggest that it is that aspect,
                  my Lord.

             Q. The drink.  You can't bring drink on the trains? - A. That
                is right, added to which they cannot get drink because we
                take them off the train, pack them, escort them to the
                stadium and put them to the turnstiles.

                        Now in 1987 I had something in the region of 13 trains
                  and in 1988 I think it was three and this year it was one
                  and there were 450 on that train, so the figure has diminished
                  considerably over those three years.

             Q. Just one this year? - A. Yes, into Wadsley Bridge.

             Q.        MR. COLLINS:   I thought it was two, but it is only
                  one, is it? - A. Yes, 450 fans on, whereas last year there
                  was something in the region of 1600 fans on those trains
                  which we could get immediately to the stadium.

             Q. You can also have some control over the timing or the time
                at which they arrive at the stadium? - A. Yes, we have
                liaison with British Rail who ensure, as in this case,
                I think I was not involved in the final plan this year
                but I know it came in at 2.08 which would give us ample
                time.  In fact I know they were down at the stadium at
                2.15 those 450 whereas that might have been a lot more
                had they used the trains in that way.

             Q. So that is the train side.  Now the other side is road
                and again one is split between coach, mini bus and private
                car? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.
                                   B.L. MOLE


So far as coaches are concerned you can have some control
inasmuch of course it is a criminal offence to permit
drinking on the coach, isn't it? - A. It is sir, yes.

You can allocate and do allocate particular places for
coaches to park? - A. We do sir, yes.

And it would be possible, would it not, to do exactly the
same as you do with trains with coaches? - A. Yes it is
sir, yes.

Is that in fact done? - A. It is done by a different method
insofar as the coach reception area, if I extend the plan
a little because the coaches are checked out of motorway
intersections for a start.    There are check teams at motor­
w a y intersections which would be in this case Tankersley
and coming down the motorway to Tinsley where check teams
check the coaches and in fact bring them in in a group, so
in fact if one has come we might hold them in and bring
about half a dozen down depending on the speed at which they
are arriving and escort them on a motorcycle escort to the
coach parking areas.

      The difference is that because coaches don't come
at a scheduled time is that you don't have an escort group
awaiting them.

      With a train you have an escort group of Officers
together with mounted men who offload the train, pack it
and then escort it to the stadium.

      Coaches are coming in twos,  threes,  fours,  fives,
sixes all the time, so the part of the plan is on the
routes from the coach park to the station those routes
are manned by Officers so rather than a mobile escorting
system it is a static escorting system because the coach
fans are offloaded and then pointed along the road which
is already taken by Policemen and they are walking through
the escorted Policemen as opposed to the escort walking with
them.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  So you are aiming to have a
Police presence all the way along the route? - A. The
serials are deployed on foot and they are virtually static
points, end of each road junction etc. and the football
supporters from coaches are walking through that which
I would describe as an escort.

      MR. COLLINS: Are steps taken to try to stop them
going off down side roads? - A. Every effort is made to
do that sir, yes.

Are efforts made to ensure that they are not drinking too
much? - A. It is always an effort to stop people drinking
too much and in fact there are signs at most matches that
    rA
^                                 98

                                              B.L. MOLE


            people are drinking.  That is taken from them. As they
            are not allowed to enter the stadium with it they are
            either thrown or whether they drink it, provided they
            are not drunk it is not an offence to enter the stadium
            and if they have had it before and had some drink there
            is little I can do about it. Certainly they are encouraged
            not to drink.

         Q. What about control or check on ticket holding? - A. Yes,
            when on the check points I have referred to out on the
            perimeters, the brief is for Officers to enter the coaches
            or mini buses and make that enquiry to ask if they have
            tickets or if they have not.  There is no power in law
            an offence for someone to go to a match without a ticket
            and it would be a matter of encouraging that individual
            not to attend that event without a ticket.

                  That is achieved, as it has been on all the events
            I have been involved in, first of all by media appeals
            leading up to the event to say "If you have not tickets
            please don't come, it is an all ticket event" and then
            it is backed up by checks and encouragement to ask them to
            go.

                  On occasions it has been where we have had a full
            coach load.  It has been the policy and decision and I
            have taken that decision to turn that coach around and
            escort it back to the motorway and that policy has been
            followed.

                  You have a difficulty if you have 50 on a coach in
            which two or three have not got tickets as to what power
            you have to deal with those individuals.

         Q. I will come back to tickets I think later because it is
            a subject on its own.  Let me continue on with the question
            of access.

                  We have dealt with coaches. Now a quite substantial
            number come by coach, do they not? - A. That varies
            depending on the groups, but yes a substantial number do
            still travel and we can have 50, 60 or more coaches depending
            on which event it is.  I cannot quote the number that came
            on this event but certainly a lot do come by coach, but
            again I believe that is diminishing.  There is a growth for
            the mini vans and private transport which seems to be
            developing.

         Q. Now can one lump mini vans and private transport together?
            - A. Not really because in our plans we have a mini van
            parking area which we do the same as we do with the coach
            parks and in fact again so far as the Liverpool supporters
            are concerned, the Halifax Road is manned and Penistone
            Road with Officers at static points right down that road
            leading on Leppings Lane and again those people are directed
                          99
                                     B.L.MOLE


  through that cordon in the loosest word of Officers stretching
  down the road, so the policy for mini vans is much the same.

        So far as cars are concerned we identify through the
  media those areas which would be best for them to park in.
  For Liverpool you are talking about Fox Hill and Parsons
  Cross areas which are the estates on the same side so they
  are encouraged to be in that vicinity where after match we
  can say:   "All coaches, trains, cars, mini buses this way
  please" and you can escort them all in the same direction
  because that is where all the vehicles, all the transport
  is parked.

         There is little or no control as to how you deal with
   cars except for the random checks of Officers and mobile
   patrols which I would refer to as "Tango" units who supplement
   those Officers on foot.  In fact there were six units doing
   that very function, one allocated to Fox Hill and one to
   Parsons Cross, not only for public order matters but also
   for that aspect of checking and seeing what supporters are
   in those vicinities.

Q. One can see the point of the north effectively going north
   and the south effectively going south, but it would be
   possible, wouldn't it, to reverse the parking arrangements.
   For example on the motorway access you simply direct the
   Liverpool fans to come off at the south exit whereas you
   direct the Nottingham fans to come off at the more northerly
   exit? - A. You still have the situation where you have a
   crossflow and particularly for the north side of the stadium,
   as I have already mentioned you have two access routes which
   are linked because if you talk about the Middlewood Road and
   running down to Hillsborough, you have access to that route
   coming from the south if people come over the southern part
   of the city which could cause clashes and confrontation,
   and likewise when you have them coining down the Stocksbridge
   Valley you have to bring them on that route as well.   It
   does not have the motorway check facility without extending
   the system well out of the County into an area which could
   check on the Stocksbridge Valley and coming over the taoors
   route, as it were, from the Manchester side, and I think
   having looked at all those considerations I believe you would
   have considerable disruption.  Segregation could not positively
   be achieved and I believe that public order would be the
   consequence.

Q. Segregation surely only becomes of real importance when you
   have fans on foot on the street, doesn't it? I appreciate
   there can be incidents when cars mingle but that you can't
   avoid happening anyway, can you? - A. You have great diffi­
   culty in avoiding that whatever plans you do. All we can
   plan for is the best possible mode of keeping the fans
   apart.  It is a sad fact of life that there are an element
   of fans, and I must say here and now the vast majority are
   little or no difficulty, and it is catering for that minority
   that are, but I believe we must find the method of maintaining

             the most positive and realistic segregation to the benefit of
             all who can attend that sporting venture without difficulty
             or danger and really that is what we are trying to achieve
             by segregation on the best possible routes.  I believe yes
             you could change it round but I believe that the risk would
             be too great and it should remain in the split that we have
             achieved for those very reasons I have explained.

        Q. Of course there are other matters which can be thrown into
           the pot, as it were, which include the possible other effects
           of allocation.

                   Now let's go back to 1988 first of all.  In 1988 we
             know that Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were allocated
             the same ends? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

        Q. Nov/ that decision was made presumably basically on the grounds
           that you have already been indicating to us? - A. That is
           correct.   I think it would fair to say that when the decision
           to hold a semi-final is made I as Divisional Commander am
           approached by the club to see if we would be prepared to
           stage that event, or police that event.   My response to that
           is "Yes, we would be prepared to police it on the terms of
           segregation I have described".   If that is not acceptable to
           the F.A. or the Club then it would not go ahead.   That is
           the only input I would have and that conversation in 1988
           took place and whilst appeals were made for it to be reversed,
           I merely gave the reasons I have given this afternoon as to
           why I would wish to police it in that way.

        Q. Can I deal with it in two stages.  You say that in 1988 you
           were approached by the Club about the possibility of staging
           the semi-final? - A. That is correct sir.

        Q. And you were asked whether effectively there were any Police
           objections or Police conditions.   Is that what it boils
           down to? - A. I think basically the question is "Can we
           police it?" We have to take into consideration what other
           events are taking place in South Yorkshire at that time,
           so that is a first consideration because there is manpower,
           there are matters which are affecting the Force as a whole,
           so first of all can   we police it is the question? There  is
           also the question I   have just addressed by saying that:
           "Yes, we can police   it but it would have to be in this way"
           otherwise we would   find great difficulty in maintaining
           public order which is our prime function.

        Q.    Indeed,     so you effectively tell them that if they stage it
             then it must be on the basis of Liverpool having the west
             and the south? - A. The west and the north.

        Q.    And the    south and the east to Nottingham Forest? - A. That
             is right and that is a matter for them to decide if they
             want to go ahead with the semi-final on those terms.

Q. Did either the Club or the F.A. or anyone that you can recall
   in 1988 make any representations that it should be the other
   way round? - A. They did indeed.  I attended a meeting at
   Sheffield Wednesday with representatives of the F.A.; represen­
   tatives of the two Clubs involved and Sheffield Wednesday Club
   together with my own Officers and that comment was made.   The
   same explanation that I have given here today was given at
   that time and those aspects of my argument were accepted.

          I was conscious, as they were, that Liverpool have a
   large following, but if it was felt that they could accommodate
   that number of tickets that they were to deal with and in the
   knowledge of that, then that was the way they decided to go
   ahead.

Q. And you say that you made it crystal clear to them in 1988
   that effectively the only way which the Police would allow,
   if that is the right word, the event to be staged, was that
   Liverpool would as the northern side, would have to have that
   end? - A. That is correct sir, and the same question arose
   on this occasion.

Q. What I am getting at is it would follow from that that before
   they even asked you in 1989 they must have been aware that
   this was your thinking? - A. They clearly were sir.

Q. And when they did ask you in 1989 this is a matter again
   which was raised, was it? - A. It was raised and I replied
   in the same manner and in fact the Secretary of Sheffield
   Wednesday did ring me I believe twice on that matter because
   he received an appeal I believe from Liverpool for a change
   and said he would have to take it back to the F.A. which he
   did and then came back to me and said they still wanted to
   go ahead with it. They did tell me that Liverpool would
   make a formal objection to the allocation because of the
   realise of their supporters, that is a formal objection to
   the F.A., and that is a matter for them sir.

Q. Now in 1988 had you had a problem with a number of fans
   coming from Liverpool without tickets? - A. I think in all
   matches you always have an element of people who will do
   whatever despite what you ask them to do and I would say yes
   we had some fans come without tickets.    The answer to the
   question of whether it was a problem is I don't believe it
   was a problem   last year and in fact I would be foolish to
   say that they   did not come but I think some did come without
   tickets.

Q. It is something that you anticipated as a likelihood? - A.
   I think there is a likelihood whenever you have an all
   ticket match some will persist in coming.

Q. Now of course in 1989, this year, Liverpool had perhaps been
   doing rather better generally and were on the up and up as
   it were and that always attracts greater fan support, doesn't
   it? - A. I think that is fair comment sir, yes.

                                     B.L. MOLE


Q. Added to that you had had specific complaints from the Club
   about the lack of tickets because they were at the wrong
   end, as they thought? - A. I had not had complaints.

Q. Well you had heard via Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Liverpool
   had made representations to the F.A.

Q. So did it not occur to you that it was likely to be possibly
   a greater problem people coming and trying to get in without
   tickets and the associated problems of forgery and touting?
   - A. I think forgeries and touting are always a problem.
   I certainly would not wish to say would be a 'greater problem"
   because I would hope that people, the vast majority of people
   know that if you have got 20 tickets and 20 tickets have
   gone that is what has gone.  There is no facilities or
   accommodation for others, and there would be appeals that
   would be made through the media and through their own
   programmes weeks before the event for them not to come without
   tickets, I would have been hopeful that any right thinking
   person using commonsense would not attempt such a venture.

        I think so far as ticket touts are concerned you always
  get that element and clearly we respond to that and I believe
  on this occasion dealt with some ticket touts. It is a problem,
  it is one that we are aware of and attempt to deal with, but
  I think the answer to your question is no, I would not receive
  a greater problem.  I believe there is only one element usually
  who will attend and that is much the same on most occasions,
  it may be slightly up or down but I would not have expected it
  to be a "greater problem".




                                 /Q. Do you think
                       103
                                        B.L. MOLE




Do you think perhaps you've got too great a faith in human
nature in saying that you expected people not to come
because of announcements?     A. I think for me to have a
crystal ball, sir, would be difficult.  I hope that people
will respond to commonsense.  There is little I can do
except try and accommodate that, and I believe that the
plans that were made were made to accommodate that
difficulty, and I really would be very hopeful that people
would respond to the appeals that were made, which were
genuine and in the interests of encouraging a pleasant
sporting event which this nation usually enjoys.

Indeed.  Mr. Mole I think everyone would sympathise with
your hopes but your experience as a Police Officer must
have surely taught you that hope was not always fulfilled.
   A. The same appeals were made last year.  I made them
personally on television and radio and afterwards I was
delighted to report back to the media that I was delighted
with the response of supporters, and in fact they did
respond.  I think there are many elements which affect that
and I think it is a sad fact that you can't cater for every
element such as the weather - and it was a super day, which
may well have had some bearing on the desire for people to
attend and to get the feel and flavour for it. You can't
cater for those aspects, but I honestly believe that the
vast majority of people responded and would respond to
those appeals.

Let me come later to whether it was catered for
sufficiently.  I don't believe it is likely is it that the
nature of the Liverpool fan changed radically between 1988
and 1989.  - A. The nature of the fan?

Yes.   -   A. No I don't think so.

What I am getting at is that you were likely to have had
the same proportion of people drinking too much, the same
proportion of people making a nuisance of themselves as in
1988 as you had in 1989.  - A. In terms of intelligence
the attitude and behaviour of the fans has been very good
this season and that too was taken into account, and in
fact we had enjoyed Liverpool visiting Sheffield Wednesday
on, I would be guessing at the date but I think it was the
14th January this year when they attended the first
division match with Sheffield Wednesday, and the fans'
behaviour was excellent on that occasion.  I think I
believe I am correct in saying resulting in only four
arrests.

It has been said that 1988 event went off, so far as the
Police were concerned, well.     A. I believe it was a
successful event.

                                           B.L. MOLE




Did you identify any problems?   -   A. With fans or in
policing terms?

Generally.  - A. There were one or two areas which we
wished to improve upon.  So far as tickets I have already
mentioned, if we had the opportunity to police the match
again.  So far as some of our deployment regarding traffic
points, some minor matters to do with logistics and
welfare, but basically little or no difficulty with the
general plan based upon the segregation I've talked about,
the accommodation of fans, the parking etcetera, there were
no changes to that.  I believe that we had some Officers if
I use the term 'under-employed* in the 1988 event, and I
had made note of that to take cognisance of that if we had
a similar event this year, not knowing of course that it
would be the same teams, and would look at that when the
situation arose.

The basic 1under-employment1 was where?  - A. In fact we
had a number of serials - if I can refer to serials as a
Sergeant and ten Officers - allocated throughout the areas
around the ground, and in one particular area, which
extended from Hillsborough Corner, Hillsborough shopping
centre, right out through Middlewood and out towards
Oughtibridge and Deepcar, we had a serial which I believe
was under-employed because I expected greater problems in
the Hillsborough precinct area from previous experience of
other matches.

Is this what the press like to call fans rampaging through
shopping centres?  - A.   That is correct, and there was
some intelligence about that after kick-off of fans
rampaging through shopping centres.  That didn't transpire
last year and in fact I took note of reducing the serial on
that location if we had to police the event again.
Likewise I had a reserve serial at the stadium.   In fact I
had three reserve serials, two were correctly in being, the
third one was possibly a luxury and was not utilised at all
last year and that was the other main area of reduction,
but that serial had been deployed to the Nottingham side
and had been located at the Spion Kop area.  In fact the
two reserve serials this year remain the same as last year,
one in the gymnasium and one behind the Police control box
adjacent to the south stand on Leppings Lane terraces.
Other reductions were merely in serial size in that where a
Sergeant and ten had been employed before some were reduced
to a Sergeant and eight, with specific functions instead of
having no direct action to take, and they were the main
areas.  There was nothing altered inside the stadium
except for an increase on the perimeter track because of
the pitch invasion last year, when after match the fans
from the terraces did in fact climb the fences and invade
the pitch.

                                              B.L. MOLE




Q. But apart from that reduction which you have described am I
   right in thinking there was essentially no change between
   the plans '88 and '89? - A. The plans in essence were
   exactly the same.  Serials were deployed to the same
   locations in the same numbers with the exception of those
   two I have referred to.   The only change in plan concerned
   an additional use of coach reception Officers at what we
   would call Phase 2, and for the benefit there are three
   phases to the operation ....

Q.    Before, during and after.   - A. Before, during and after.
     At Phase 2 Officers on coach reception had been briefed to
     attend at the stadium to sit on Police coaches to be
     available for deployment if required, and in fact that
     amounted to some fifty Officers in Leppings Lane after
     kick-off, and fifty in Penistone Road North who would be
     pulled in to be a reserve feature if they should be
     required.   That was the only change in the plan basically.
     My initial plan last year was that they stayed out of the
     coach parks.

Q. Basically, if I have correctly followed the evidence that
   we have heard, the general opinion has been that the event
   last year went off reasonably well but there were some
   complaints of overcrowding on the terraces on the west
   terraces.   Is that something that you were aware of?
   A. I have no knowledge of that, no sir.

Q.    By which I mean that some fans found themselves in a rather
     unpleasant crush although nothing that was dangerous.
     A. As I say I have no knowledge of the complaints you refer
     to but I will accept that possibly some did find themselves
     because there is a desire, and a creditable one sometimes,
     to be in the best position, and often fans will try and
     seek to be behind the goal to get the best vantage point
     and put the crush into that type of an area.

Q. I would like to also concern with getting in through the
   Leppings Lane turnstiles.  Now last year the consensus of
   evidence is that there was considerable policing on the way
   down to the turnstiles which weeded out those who didn't
   have any tickets, because this was a question specifically
   asked by Officers that fans should show their tickets.   -
   A. I think that that is a situation which applies
   generally, that there are random selections of people
   regarding ticket holding.  It is almost an impracticability
   to check every individual, but certainly the knowledge that
   that action takes place - and I know it has taken place at
   the most matches I've been to where it is ticket holder,
   where there are random checks on individuals having
   tickets.   It took place in 1987 with Coventry and Leeds
   and it took place in 1988 and I am quite confident from the
                        106
                                           B.L. MOLE




   plans I have seen that the same policy would be followed
   this year.

Q. You say "random".   Were there any specific instructions
   givan to the relevant serials that Police Officers who were
   lining the approach roads as to what they should do about
   this checking of tickets?   - A.   Officers were briefed to
   check for people with tickets and to encourage them to
   leave the area.   If in fact they didn't leave the area
   then there is little one can do unless we are faced with an
   obstruction of the highway which is an offence which can be
   pursued.  It is not made for people without tickets but
   there are occasions when their presence may well fulfil
   that need and Officers are briefed in that direction, but
   it is not a matter of being able to check every one of
   twenty four thousand people.

Q. I follow that.  - A. And there is a random selectivity of
   those with or without tickets.

Q. It seems that the random was rather more widespread, if I
   may put it that way, last year than it was this year.   In
   other words more checking last year than there was this
   year.  - A. I think a great deal depends on what time
   people arrive.  It is a sad feature that many people decide
   that they can enter a stadium in the last five minutes
   prior to kick-off, and my views this year are that a great
   deal came in the last few minutes.  If that weight of
   number comes then the random selectivity of checking is
   lessened.  If there is a steady stream then clearly
   Officers can check on a more regular number of times.

Q. Now last year you had no traffic problems, is that right?
      A. 1987 I did but last year no.

Q. In 1987 you say you did, did that mean a lot of people
   arrived rather late? - A. One of the features of 1987,
   and the lessons learned, was in fact we attempted to check
   every vehicle out of the motorway intersection and as a
   consequence I believe we went some way to creating hold-ups
   and delays, which you may recall resulted in some media
   coverage on the motorways with people spilling out and
   walking on the sides.  As a consequence of that, in 1988
   the plan was drawn in somewhat and again more random
   checking was carried out of those locations followed up by
   checkings of the coach park.  I believe tht this year's
   plan was the same as that but we did cause delay in 1987.

Q. You see if the problem is identified, as I think the Police
   have to some extent identified it, as people arriving in
   time but then going off to pubs and leaving it till the
   last moment actually to go to the ground, surely that
   attitude would have been the same in '88 as it was in '89.

                                              B.L. MOLE




        A. I think that is correct but I think the more often
     that people visit an area, where I believe that a firm and
     fair policing policy applies - and that is at Sheffield
     Wednesday - they become very much conscious of our
     activities.  One of our plans is that public houses in the
     vicinity of the stadium are asked to either close or use a
     rear door policy and not to allow supporters in, and the
     vast majority of those public houses agree to that.  The
     problem with that is it tends to push the problem out, and
     once people learn of that then it may well be they seek to
     obtain alcohol further afield.

Q. So what you are saying is you think pople may have had to
   go further afield to get a drink and thus made themselves
   that much later?  - A. I am not saying people may have had
   to go, what I am saying is that we try to discourage the
   use of drink and because they realise our activities, like
   the train activity I've mentioned, there's a diminishing
   use of that, by the fact that we try and control the public
   houses, those intent upon obtaining drink may well seek
   other avenues.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Would you prefer to have public
     houses closed?  - A. Generally sir I think so, yes.   It
     clearly has a factor to play.

Q. Completely closed or closed from a particular time? - A.
   I think the difficulty with that is knowing how far you are
   going to extend it, because I may push it out even further,
   or whether or not matches should be played at such times
   when drink is not available, but of course there is also
   the element last year which was learnt and that is the
   using of off-licence premises, and I believe clearly that
   was used considerably this year when the 'four pack'
   syndrome came into being far greater.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   You would have to close off-licences as
     well as pubs if you wanted to have any effect.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose if you simply extend
     the non alcohol area outwards you cause those who are under
     their own steam to stop earlier and come later.  - A. That
     is right.  And of course the other spin-off is that you
     thin the Police presence or you have to have a greater
     presence to go wider and wider until you .... How far do
     you go?

Q. Just your own view from a great deal of experience you have
   had, what about allowing drink to be served inside the
   ground?  - A. The comment I have made in the past is when
   we have drink inside the ground I would defy anybody to get
   more than one pint.
                         108
                                            B.L. MOLE




Q. Just because of the numbers trying to do it? - A. That is
   correct.  I can't speak that that would be an answer to the
   problem but clearly that was the case, that a pie and a
   pint was probably the most they could get.

Q. Did that cause frustration and aggro or not? - A. It
  5 caused a little, and without criticising, and I don't
    criticise the law because I think it was important that it
    was changed, but it is a spin-off that people didn't go in
    to have their drink and a pie now as they did before, and
    the problem we now see I believe is a spread further
    afield because of the practical efforts we are trying to
    introduce to combat it.

Q.»      MR. COLLINS:   The disadvantage it would seem is that
    it does encourage certain elements to come in late, to put
    in as much drinking time as possible before getting to the
  ‘ ground.  - A. I think that is a correct statement.

Q. And it is your view that that is one effect of the ban of
   alcohol in sports grounds.  - A. I think it is a
   possibility, and I think we try and cater for that.  I have
   mentioned the Tango Units, which have a particular
   responsibility.  They are transit vans with a Sergeant and
   five or six in, to tour, and there are six on either side
   of the operation, that is six for Liverpool and six for
   Nottingham, whose brief is to spread out and to look for
   that type of activity spreading.

Q. Bearing that in mind and the pattern of the possibility of
   late arrivals, did you have any policy in '88 and '87 about
   deferment of kick-off if necessary?  - A. I did delay
   kick-off in *87.

Q. That was because of the late arrival due to traffic
   problems?  - A. Yes.   In '87 I had in some way helped to
   create the difficulty by the introduction of the checking
   of vehicles to a much greater extent.




                                   /Q. At what stage
                           109


                                                    B.L. MOLE


Q. At what stage did you postpone kick-off? - A. I postponed it
   at about - I am guessing back in time - about 20-to-3,
   something of that region, having discussed with the managers
   and the referee that I knew I had got a tremendous amount of
   people outside, well outside the area, and I had no
   possibility of getting them to the stadium and in the stadium,
   and in fact delayed the kick-off for 15 minutes.

Q. Was there a build up outside the Leppings Lane entrance as far
   as you can recall at the time you made your decision, or was
   it that people had not actually reached Leppings Lane? - A.
   That is correct.   There was no build up, and in fact we were
   able to control that arrival, because by releasing the amount
   of checking, and one of my instructions was that the checking
   would cease in the format we made and it would become random,
   and then we brought coaches through as quickly as possible in
   groups and put them into the stadium.   In fact, albeit I went
   on with the kick-off at quarter-past instead of on the hour, I
   could really have probably delayed it longer because there was
   still a lot of people to come, but because we were able to
   control that and knowing where they were - they were at the
   motorway intersections and being brought in en masse so we
   could bring them in - we were able to control it,   and that is
   the way we did it.

Q.   And thus avoid any scrummage? - A. That is correct.

Q.   Because one thing of which you were clearly aware was that
     Leppings Lane is less than ideal and is a bottleneck? - A.
     Leppings Lane is a difficult area, and clearly when you look
     at the Penistone Road side, it is a much easier area to
     control than Leppings Lane.

Q. Leppings Lane is quite plainly, as I put it, a bottleneck.
   You are bound to get trouble there unless you have got smooth
   operation of the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. And not too many people coming at once? - A. I think the
   question that you are bound to get trouble is not altogether
   correct.   We don't always have trouble.  We have a lot of
   people come many comes, and I did not have trouble last  ye a r .
   People flowed in a nice steady flow and were able to be
   accommodated into the stadium.   I think at kick-off there were
   still a few out as I remember, but by 5-past-, 10-past-3
   everybody was in and comfortably in the stadium.    They
   certainly had not left it until the last few minutes to
   get into the stadium.

Q. If I may go back to your policy on deferring kick-off, what
   was it in 1988? - A. 1988?

Q.   Yes. -A. The question did not arise in 1988.

Q.   I know it did not, but you must have had a policy?  - A. The
     policy, as overall operational Commander, it is a matter for
     me to assess the problems being faced and to whether or not I
     would cause any difficulty by not going on with the match

                                                 B.L. MOLE


     until later.  That would have to take into account any factors
     which were facing me, and in 1988 I was quite confident that
     what I had got coming to the stadium was there and would be in
     the stadium in good time.  I based that upon looking at the
     numbers of people outside, and in fact I recall on checking
     that physically, because I operate out and about, and if I can
     see that build up and see how it was moving, then my
     assessment would be based upon that, together with information
     from my Sector Commanders who were able to advise me as to
     what their problems if any were.

Q. You say you got out and about.  You spent some time, I
   suppose, in the control room, because you had video cameras
   which could tell you what the position was at the gates? - A.
   Y e s , indeed.

Q. Did you go and look as well? - A. I do go and look as well,
   and my method of operation is that I have a capable Officer in
   the form of Superintendent Murray who operates the control
   room and whose ability I find first class.     I can rest upon
   h i m , as can my sector Commanders who are selected by m e , and
   in fact last were the same as this year, albeit the roles were
   reversed insofar as Mr. Greenwood was in fact the Liverpool
   sector Commander and Mr. Marshall was the ground.     They had
   swapped placed.     I made that decision based upon the years of
   experience of Mr. Marshall which was greater than Mr.
   Greenwood. M r . Chapman was another Sector Commander at the
   other side of the stadium.     All those Officers I have
   mentioned are thoroughly professional and well experienced in
   policing football matches.     I valued their assessment and
   would operate upon their assessment and abilities, together
   with my own views and perception of what was being
   experienced.

Q. But you felt as person in overall charge it was necessary and
   desirable for you to be on the move, as it were, as well as in
   the control room? - A. That is my style, yes, sir.

Q. And that way you could build up your own assessment of any
   trouble points? - A. Yes, indeed.   I tended to spend time on
   the perimeter track. I always spend time in Leppings Lane and
   in Penistone Road, and in between that time I visit the
   control room, etc.   By about 10-to-3, 5-to, I would
   normally be at the players' tunnel.

Q. And you would be in radio contact? - A. All the time.

Q. Presumably all the time.  Did you have any radio problems in
   1988 at all? - A. We had some interference from a local radio
   station, but that purely was coincidental, but so far as radio
   problems are concerned communications between Officers, none.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What did you say? By 2.50 you
     would have been at the players' tunnel? - A. That is my usual
     policy, my Lord.  I come to the entrance on the field by the
     players' tunnel, by which time I can see visually the packing
     generally, how the crowd is.   I have got Sector Commanders

     doing the jobs outside and I am in a position to see the teams
     come on the pitch and speak to the ref if need be, although I
     would have spoken to him before.  I usually speak to the ref
     about half-an-hour or 40 minutes before kick-off as to the
     kinds of policies and demarcation lines which would apply on
     the pitch area.  In brief, "The pitch is yours, the rest of it
     is mine".

Q.        MR. COLLINS:       Going back to postponement of kick-off, if
     there were a problem at Leppings Lane, for example, a build up
     which made it perfectly plain that people were not going to
     get in in time, the reason for that would not matter, would
     it? What I am getting at is if it was caused by people of
     their own volition coming late that should not make any
     difference, should it, to the decision to postpone kick-off? -
     A. No, I would not expect that.      If you had, and I can't speak
     for this occasion,*     I was not there - you have to see how the
     build up is.    Experience tells you whether that number of
     people can get in, and I think if people were to visit and
     look at Penistone road at 10-to-3 on any match day you would
     think, "My w o r d , that is never going to get i n " , and it gets
     in.  It goes in very quickly and usually flows very fast.
     That is something you experience.      In fact, I marvel at it
     probably every time I watch it.      At first I used to think it
     would not go in and I look at that crowd and now with
     experience know that it will go in.

Q. That is the value of experience. - A. That is right.    I think
   that same experience comes to M r . Murray who is in the control
   room, and Mr. Murray has that same ability having policed
   those matches for some time.  The question as to whether or
   not being faced with that mass number would affect delay is
   something that would not affect it.    If you had a problem and
   you did not think it would get in then that consideration of
   delay could be carried out at that time.

Q. All I am getting at is the reason for the build up is
   irrelevant.  It is the fact that it happens that matters, is
   not it? - A. If you are faced with something which you believe
   cannot get in, but also there are other considerations as to
   what is happening in the ground.  Often the difficulty is
   whether or not players are on the field by that time, whether
   the attitude of the fans inside have reacted positively to the
   expectancy of kick-off, whether they would over-react to a
   situation, and I think those factors have to be taken into
   account as well.  If you 21,000 people on the Kop who have
   arrived in good time, all ready to go, and you are then
   having to look at a delay, you have that consideration to
   take in as well as the consideration of those outside who
   have not arrived.

Q. I want to ask you about another aspect of your plan, and that
   is th i s . There is nothing in the Operation order in 1988 or
   indeed in 1989 which caters for any Police presence on the
   terraces as opposed to the West Stand and in front of the
   terraces.    It was normal, was it not, in league matches for
   example, to have at least one and probably more Officers
                            112

                                                   B.L. MOLE


     actually policing the terraces? - A. As has been mentioned
     earlier with the league matches, the numbers attending are far
     less than they are at full capacity.  If you have a capacity
     crowd then you are putting Officers and anyone else into risk
     if you swallow them up in the crowd and their effectiveness
     disappears.  So far as a capacity crowd on the terraces is
     concerned you would not expect to have serials actually
     deployed on the terraces because their effectiveness is nil in
     their ability to respond to public order, which is their
     problem.  You would note from the Order that Serials, and I am
     trying to recall, 13 are in the West Stand, 14 and 15 on the
     terraces, Serials 14 and 15 had particular duties at the back
     of the terraces, and that phase 2 are deployed to 1, the
     central tunnel and 2, the north tunnel, and they are supported
     by Serials 17 and 18 I believe from outside, which gives you
     two Serials at both tunnels specifically to respond to
     public order matters.  In addition the reserve Serial 20 or
     21 is located by the South Stand and the West Stand terraces
     to respond to the southern pen of the terraces to deal with
     public order matters.

          In a league match there is the ability for those serials
     to be deployed more loosely because the packing on the terrace
     is fluid.   We also control to some extent whether all of the
     terrace is to be used in a league match or just part of it.
     Officers will often be seen on the pens adjacent to those
     which are being used ready to respond to public disorder.

Q.    So to put it in a nutshell, if there is capacity you
     c a n ’t in your view use Officers on the terraces because
     they are overwhelmed by the numbers? - A. Their
     effectiveness is negated, and I need them to respond if
     there is a difficulty from the avenues which are given
     to them, that is the tunnels at either end or in the
     centre.

Q. You are no doubt familiar with the ACPO Sub-Committee Report
   on the Guide to Policing Football.  Is that right? - A. I have
   read it, sir.

Q.   It is something that you took on board, I don't doubt,       in your
     planning for football at Hillsborough? - A. Certainly.

Q. ACPO Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, Guide to
   Policing Football, published in October 1987. - A. I have seen
   the document, and y e s , I have taken those comments into
   account.

          MR. WOODWARD:   I do not know if the witness has a bundle
     of those.  (Document produced)

Q.        MR. COLLINS:    It is document No. 12 in the first of the
     exhibit volumes, Mr. Mole.   I ask you to turn, please, to
     paragraph 1.40 to start with.   I will take it in order.   While
     Lord Justice Taylor's copy is being fetched, read to yourself
     1.40 to 1.49.   It starts, "Entrance to the ground".   It is
     going back slightly, Mr. Mole.   I want to start with 1.43,
                                              B.L. MOLE


which deals with the turnstiles and queueing. - A. Yes.

     "Queues forming at turnstiles should be closely monitored
     by Police and stewards.  It is recommended that mounted
     Officers where available are used for this purpose.
     There is often frustration at turnstiles if queues remain
     after the game has started.  Orderly control will
     minimise the risks” .

That is pointing out something which is perhaps obviously,
that if you d o n ’t have order outside you are liable to get a
crush and just the sort of problems that arose last month.
That is correct, is not it? - A. I think there is a
possibility of problems if you have not order outside, yes,
sir.

     Q.   But you did not c a t e r for it.                    A.      We c a t e r e d for it
          in so far as O f f i c e r s out on the p e r i p h e r a l areas.                 So

          on the s t a d i u m , t h e r e is l i t t l e one c a n do to a n t i c i p a t e

                                            B.L. MOLE



     Q.         MR. COLLINS:  You see you have got 23 turnstiles to
          get in 24,000 people, putting it very broadly? - A. Yes.

     Q. And it is not as simple as that because A-G, that is seven
        turnstiles, have got to in theory accommodate all those
        goinginto the terraces, that is some 10,000? - A. 10,100.

     Q. On simple flow rates of turnstiles you are going to be pushed
        to get that sort of number in in less than an-hour-and-a-half?
        A. Not being one of my areas of responsibility I would not
        really be definitive, but I know that the Green Guide talks
        of "750" a nominal figure of people going through the turn­
        stiles, but that I believe caters for where money is changing
        hands.  We are dealing with an all ticket situation and my
        discussions with the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday in the
        past have indicated that turnstiles can accommodate something
        in the region of 1,000 an hour.

     Q. I see.  So you considered that there was no possibility,
        from your experience, no possibility of danger of a build
        up at these turnstiles assuming that there was not a sudden
        surge right towards the end? - A. I think assuming that the
        people attended responsibly in good time to enjoy the
        facility there should have been no difficulty.

     Q. But you keep on saying that "responsibly and in good time"
        but there was no entertainment was there other than the
        rather minimal sort of entertainment by some music and a sort
        of disc jockey over the Tannoy? - A. I am not aware.

     Q. Certainly there was nothing special laid on in the way of
        entertainment? - A. I am not aware what was laid on this
        year.

     Q. I am talking about 1988? - A. I would accept that there
        was no entertainment.

     Q. You have heard nothing to make you believe there was anything
        different in 1989? - A. I think in 1988 there was in fact,
        going back to memory, but I think there was some junior
        football or something.  I could not be positive on that.   I
        am trying to tie with many matches.

     Q. So people might have been encouraged by that to come in good
        time because there was something to see? - A. That may well
        have been a factor and I think again that the Popplewell
        Report talks about entertainment and I know it is mentioned
        in here.

     Q. Indeed, but there was nothing in 1989? - A. I am not aware.
        I accept what you say.  I don't know.

     Q. Now the lack of entertainment is a factor which would make^
        people not particularly keen to come into the ground early.
        It is not particularly attractive to stand on the terrace
        with nothing to do, is it? - A. I think my experience sir,

                                              B.L. MOLE


            I say this, I am not a football fan sir, I don't have much
            following that way, but I know my experience of many people
            they go to savour the atmosphere and they find the music
            and the singing together is enough atmosphere to encourage
            them to attend.

       Q. Of course an all ticket match makes some people think that
          it is going to be that much easier to get in so there is not
          such a need to arrive in good time? - A. There is that
          possibility sir.

       Q. And an arrival 20 minutes or so before kick-off would you
          consider that to be unreasonably late? - A. Personally I do.
          I think people would expect to arrive in good time to get
          comfortably to the locations where they are going. A lot
          of them not being regular attenders would not have as much
          knowledge of the ground and I would expect that most people
          would come that little bit early to find their bearings, get
          the best position they could to see the event they have
          travelled many miles to see.

       Q. All right, half-past, half-an-hour before.  Is that in your
          view an unreasonably late time to arrive? - A. I think that
          if I was in their position I would want to be in situ by
          that time.

       Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The ticket says "quarter-of-an-
            hour before"? - A. Yes, I appreciate that.   I think our
            advertising asks them to come much before that.

       Q.        MR. COLLINS:   But at least it must have been within
            the contemplation of the Police when planning this that
            surely there might be a number of late arrivals given the
            lack of entertainment and given the known propensity which
            we have heard about with Liverpool fans to arrive or to
            tend to arrive rather late? - A. When you say "the propensity"
            there is an element.   That element is not unmanageable on
            a usual event.

                  MR. WOODWARD:  I am sorry to interrupt, but I am not
            sure where we have heard this.

                  MR. COLLINS:   It may be something I have read which
            we have not heard.

       Q. Is this something of which you are aware? - A. Sorry?

       Q. Liverpool fans having the propensity to turn up .... A. I
          am conscious in recent times of there being experiences
          of some of the fans turning up late which I have read since
          which is talking about coming to one without tickets and
          Norwich comes to mind, but I have no firm details.

       Q. Let's not say Liverpool specifically but it is something
          of which the Police are aware that it does happen, sometimes
          people do tend to turn up late? - A. It is like I said before,

                                     B.L. MOLE


   there is an element within football who will do all sorts of
   ventures and there is that element with this club and many
   other clubs.

Q. Very well.  Let me come on from queueing at the turnstiles
   paragraph 1.43 which we were looking at. Paragraph 1.44:

         "All ticket matches also need turnstile control
         as supporters in possession of tickets for a
         particular section of the ground may seek to
         gain entry to another section which could result
         in some exceeding the limits specified in the
         Safety Certificate.

        Where limits are critical Police should make
        arrangements to monitor turnstile counts".

  Then it goes on in 1.45 to deal with ticket touting and
  black markets in tickets which might undermine segregation.

        Now the problem that is being identified in those two
  paragraphs is first of all the problem that people will go
  to the wrong end in effect? - A. Yes.

Q.And that is something which quite often happens where people
   have wanted to buy tickets to get into the match and then
   when they get there hope they will be able to switch to their
   supporters end? - A. That is right, that does happen.  That
   is where the colour coding has been introduced to help with
   that problem.

Q. And if that was going to happen it was likely to happen
   with Liverpool fans getting tickets allocated to Nottingham
   because of your known problem about imbalance and about the
   desire of Liverpool fans to come to the match? - A. Yes,
   there was an element and that was taken into account in
   1988 and we found a section of the Kop which we would
   utilise to accommodate that element if in fact they got
   through the system as it were at the turnstiles and in fact
   in 1988 I think I would be right in saying there was less
   than 100 accommodated.  This year there was quite a few
   more, 300-400 who had filtered on to the Kop with tickets
   and who were then moved to an area which is slightly
   elevated on the Kop adjacent to the North Stand and then a
   line of Officers, serial particularly deployed for that
   job was put down there to maintain segregation.

Q. Indeed, somewhat unsatisfactory but the best that could be
   done in the circumstances? - A. That is right.

Q. Would you accept some unsatisfactory? - A. I think that is
   right.  It is very difficult.  I have experience of moving
   a lot of supporters from the Kop in the past when it has
   been over ....

Q. But if there is no room for them at the other end you can't
   do much about it? - A. That is right.

Q. Now also of course you have the problem of non-ticket holders
   coming to buy tickets from touts or simply to try and get
   in? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Now is it not essential to keep those people right away from
   the turnstile area because they are going to create an
   obstruction and a problem, are they not? - A. It would be
   very nice to be able to do that.  The Officers on the periphery
   are briefed, as I mentioned earlier, to ask them to leave.
   There is no power of arrest for a man attending at the stadium
   without a ticket, there is no power of obstruction.

Q. If he is causing an obstruction as inevitably he will be?
   - A. I think that is a matter for debate sir, with the
   greatest of respect.  If he is merely walking down the high­
   way passing to the stadium I have little power to turn him
   away and if he continues in that direction unless he remains
   in one place and loiters and causes me to have the power to
   arrest him then I will exercise that power and Officers are
   briefed according, but if he merely persists in that area
   then I have little I can do with him.

           So far as ticket touts are concerned, which you
     mentioned, CID Officers are particularly deployed for that
     task and are constantly identifying ticket touts and arrests
     were in fact made on this occasion of ticket touts and that
     is a constant battle.

Q. Despite some misguided people who seem to think they are
   a good idea? - A. Well I think if we had not got ticket
   touts and we did not have any tickets sold on the day, we
   may not encourage non-ticket holders to attend.

Q. Ticket touts are a menace because they encourage people to
   come without tickets which creates the problems, or some
   of the problems which we have identified as having occurred
   outside the turnstiles on this occasion.  Would you agree
   with that? - A. I think as I say, I believe that ticket
   touts are the problem and I believe we should tackle that
   problem.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  How would you tackle it? - A. I
     think I would tackle it by saying we recognise the problem
     of non-ticket holders but perhaps it should be an offence
     to sell or purchase tickets at an all-ticket match on the
     day of the event.

Q. Anywhere? - A. Anywhere.  i think we should have the tickets
   sold sir before the event &nd there is then an offence with
   a power of arrest to deal with those who would sell and
   encourage those individuals to come and have a black market
   trade of forgeries.  If we had a power to deal with that
   then we may well tackle the problem of non-ticket holders
   attending the match.  I think it is difficult.

That would apply to football matches at designated grounds?
- A. I would think so.

 You would not stop Mr. Collins returning his tickets for
Covent Garden outside? - A. I would not think so.   I find
it difficult to address the problem of non-ticket holders
and I think it is difficult to find a way of dealing with
non-ticket holders but perhaps if we could attack the source
which attracts them that may be a method of dealing with them.

When you arrest them you arrest them for obstruction, not
for selling tickets? - A. That is right, sir.




                         Q. MR. COLLINS:      I have one

Q.         MR. COLLINS:   I have one more question, just to close
     this topic, and that is this.   From what you have been saying,
     too, it would be desirable in your view, would it, to have
     some Police power to remove from the area those who did
     not have tickets? - A. I think I would walk a very
     difficult line if there was a power of that nature,
     because civil liberties have to be taken into account, and
     I can't say that a man who has merely come from Liverpool who
     wants to walk down to    the turnstiles and have a look at the
     fun that is going off    — if he takes up - when I say "the
     fun” , I mean the pleasure of the day - if he takes up a
     position which would cause obstruction then I may have todeal
     with him, but I think it would be difficult to have apower of
     arrest for a man who merely had come to Sheffield or any other
     city and did not have a ticket.

Q. Yes, thank you.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    We will break off there until 10
     o'clock tomorrow.

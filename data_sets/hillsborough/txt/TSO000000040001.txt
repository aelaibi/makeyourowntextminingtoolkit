  Dear Sir,

  Hillsborough Inquiry

  We have been appointed as Agents of the Treasury Solicitor, who is the
  Solicitor who has to gather all the evidence relating to the tragic
  events of 15th April 1989.

  As you are no doubt aware, Lord Justice Taylor’s Judicial Inquiry began
  on Monday at Sheffield Tovn Hall. You have already made a written
  statement and your evidence is considered crucial to the understand!   of
    i events which occurred.

  It is therefore proposed that you should attend to give oral evidence to
  the Inquiry. We are arranging for transport of all the witnesses
  travelling from Merseyside and, accordingly, we would be grateful if you
  would telephone Mr. Lewin of this office as a matter of urgency as it is
  proposed that you should give evidence as soon as possible.

   Obviously, in giving evidence to the Inquiry you will be asked to recall
   events which you may find distressing. Accordingly, if you would like to
   be accompanied, on your journey to and from the Inquiry in Sheffield, by
   a relative or close friend this can be arranged.

   I f you are likely to suffer any loss of earnings as a result of having to
   attend the Inquiry then these may be reimbursed. However, it will be
   necessary for you to prove your loss of earnings. The easiest way of
   doing this would be for you to produce a letter from your employer
   detailing the loss. This should be presented to the Treasury Solicitor’s
   Accountant at the Town Hall in Sheffield when you give your evidence.

   We will provide you with the sum of £2.50 towards the cost of
   refreshments.

   We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

   Yours faithful

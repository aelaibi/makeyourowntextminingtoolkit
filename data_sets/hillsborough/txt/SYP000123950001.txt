 TWENTY TO GO THROUGH THE        GATE.    WE WERE THEN USHERED   TO THE VICINITY OF PEN

 THAT THEY WERE TRAINED IN FIRST AID AND OFFERING HELP.             THIS ASSISTANCE WAS

 DECLINED WHEN PERHAPS IT COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TO GOOD            USE.

 THE P.A. SYSTEM WAS INADEQUATE          AND MORE INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN TO

 THE FANS.

POTENTIAL FOR TROUBLE IN THAT VICINITY AND TAKEN POSITIVE ACTION AT AN EARLIER

STAGE.

  VITAL TO   THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

   I FEEL THAT MORE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN LEPPINGS LN TO CONTROL THE

! CROWDS FROM    2.30PM <1430) ONWARDS.   THERE SEEMED TO BE A SENIOR OFFICER THERE

   IN A LANDROVER WITH A RADIO WHO SHOULD HAVE REALISED THAT THE SITUATION WAS

1 BUILDING UP    AND GETTING OUT OF HAND AND CALLED OUT MORE OFFICERS.    THE THING

  THAT MADE ME REALISE THIS WAS WHEN SO MANY OFFICERS WERE CALLED OUT TO PATROL

  THE HALF-WAY LINE.     IF ONLY A FEW OF THEM HAD BEEN IN LEPPINGS L N , POSSIBLY THE

  CROWD CRUSH MAY HAVE BEEN STOPPED.

 CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 PLACE ON THE PITCH AND A _CHEER WENT UP.   I PUT THIS AT A P O I N T , AS I.WAS LATER
                          - 9vr -    .

 WERE YOU INJURED, IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 MY SHINS WERE SCRAPED A FEW TIMES AND THEY WERE BRUISED.       I PROBABLY DID THE

 SAME TO SOMEONE ELSE.    IT WAS PURELY REACTION. TRYING TO STAY UPRIGHT.

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO. NOT IN THE PROCESS OF DYING, BUT I DID SEE i LAD BETWEEN 10-14 BEING

 PASSED OVER OUR HEADS. HE WAS A VERY FUNNY COLOUR AND OBVIOUSLY DEAD. THERE

 WERE SEVERAL DEAD & INJURED BROUGHT PAST ME AS TIME WENT ON.

 G48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,    IF SO,

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 BACK UP TOWARDS THE TUNNEL. I WAS N’T ABLE TO ASSIST WITH A N Y .


Q17

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE POLICE, THEY WOULDN’T OPEN THE GATES TO LET PEOPLE OUT. I EVEN SAW THEM

 PUSHING THOSE WHO WERE CLIMBING OUT BACK INTO THE CROWD.      I SAW ONE POLICEMAN
                                                                     """

, WHO UNFORTUNATELY 'I WOULDN’T RECOGNISE AGAIN, PUNCH ONE FAN IN THE FACE TO GET

 HIM BACK INTO THE CROWD.    I SAW ONE WHO APPEARED TO BE SENIOR OFFICER, STANDING

       “HE FENCE SHOUTING THROUGH A LOUD HAILER TO GET PEOPLE TO CALM DOWN. HE

     I*T HELP ING THE SITUATION AT ALL. ALSO THE AMOUNT Oi- PEOPLE STILL COMING IN
                                <£k-
 THROUGH THE TUNNEL.      ^*"1^

 G50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I'M NOT SURE,    IT WASN'T FOR QUITE A WHILE THOUGH.   I STAYED WHERE I WAS BECAUSE

 I DIDN'T WANT TO BLOCK THE PASSAGE FOR THE DEAD AND INJURED. EVEN THOUGH I

 WANTED DESPERATELY TO LEAVE.

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 NO. I DIDN'T HEAR ANY.

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW ONE FAN CLOSE TO* ME BEND DOWN, PICK UP A WRIST WATCH AND PUT IT IN HIS

 POCKET. HE WAS A SCOTTISH MAN.    I KNOW BECAUSE I HEARD HIM SPEAK. HE WAS MIDDLE

 AGED AND I THINK HE WORE GLASSES. AS I'VE ALREADY SAID ABOUT THE POLICEMAN WHO

 PUNCHED THE FAN IN THE FACE.   I ALSO HEARD OF PHOTOGRAPHERS BEING GOT AT BY

 FANS FOR TAKING PICTURES, BUT HAVING SAID THAT, THEY DESERVED IT. THIS WAS

 TOLD TO ME BY MY FRIEND WHO HAD BEEN LIFTED INTO THE STANDS AND SAW IT.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 A TOTAL LACK OF ORGANISATION. A LINE OF POLICEMEN CAME INTO THE GROUND.

 I THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HELP BUT ALL THEY DID WAS FORM A LINE ACROSS THE

 HALF-WAY LINE. IT LOOKED LIKE THEY WERE THERE TO STOP ANY KIND OF DISORDER

 THAT WAS EVEN LIKELY TO HAPPEN. THEY WERE TOTALLY WASTED.

 THE FANS THEMSELVES DID THE JOB THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE DONE, EXCEPT FOR THE

 ODD FEW WHO PITCHED IN WHEN THEY REALISED THE DEVASTATION.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL    IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I D O N 'T THINK THERE WAS ANY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE OUTLYING POLICE

 AND THOSE AT THE GROUND WITH REGARDS TO LATE ARRIVALS DUE TO TRAFFIC HOLDUPS.

 I FEEL THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN    DELAYED TO ALLOW THE CROWD TIME TO DISTRIBUTE

 THEMSELVES THROUGHOUT THE STANDS    8, TERRACES.

 DID YOU GO TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR.

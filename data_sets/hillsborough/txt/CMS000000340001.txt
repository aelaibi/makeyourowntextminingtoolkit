      Mr Moynihan has asked me to say that he enjoyed lunch with you
      and Colonel Rothschild on Wednesday 11 July. The Minister sends
      his thanks.

      You will by now know that John Patten announced in the House on
      12 July that the Chairman of the Football Licensing Authority is
      to be Norman Jacobs, a member of the Sports Council with
      extensive experience of sports administration. The membership of
      the FLA has still to be finalised and the Minister knows that you
      have made representations through John Wheeler, that someone with
      first aid experience should be appointed.

      The Minister understands that St John Ambulance have made
      representations on the Green Guide to colleagues in the Home
      Office on a number of occasions, both before and after the
      publication of Lord Justice Taylor's final report oh the
      Hillsborough Stadium disaster. These views are being taken into
      account in reviewing the guide and he understands that St John
      Ambulance will be consulted again when the draft revised guide is
      available.

      I hope this is helpful.

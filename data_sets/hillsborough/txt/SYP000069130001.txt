We     drove         all        the       way     to S h e f f i e l d          without            stopping              off     anywhere.              we

minutes             walk        from       the        Ground.



In S h e f f i e l d            we       want     for      a drink            in a        pub.          I had        to     have       the      lager

On     our        way     to     the       Ground         we      saw a         few P o l i c e m e n           but        we    didn't,        receive

I made         my w a y        into       the       middle        of     the     crowd.




The     crush          g ot    worse          and    pressure            increased           to s u c h a n      extent          that      I

Dear Chris,

                                  Re: Hillsborough


I enclose the copy statement of former Police. Inspector Harry White dated 23rd
February 1991 which Mr. Croston of the CPS has forwarded to me.

No doubt you will place this with the appropriate documents.

I hope you are keeping well.



Yours sincerely,


 S. L. Popper

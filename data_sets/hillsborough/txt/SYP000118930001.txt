                         I began my           duty       at    8 . 3 0 a.m.     on S a t u r d a y ,      15th April,             1989,      -at

                         Police        Sergeant          2279    Edwards.

                         We    were     transported             to H i l l s b o r o u g h    Football           Ground      by    public

                         transport           and    I was       briefed        together           with    other     officers,           in    the

                         No r th Stand.

                         At    11.01                                   I was     deployed           to    the     upper      corridor         on     the

                         North     Staild a n d          I worked with Police                     Constable        18 47 B u n g a y ,       to k e e p

                         The     two    of    us w e r e       given     duties       to     escort       the m o n e y      from     the     betting

ejecting         this        youth         owing      to    the      fans          pressing against                 the       gate.

Eventually            this      y o u t h was         ejected            via a gate             to    the     left       of     the

turnstiles            when      looking           outward           from       the       ground.         These          gates        were

immediately             secured again and                     no a w a i t i n g             fans    gained        e n t r y at          this

t ime .

After      the y o u t h w a s             e j e c t e d we     both made                our w a y     b ac k      to    the       upper

concourse         and        on to         the    betting           booth          ready       for    the     duties          outlined

above.

At    3.00      p.m.     I was         aware        that      the        football             match    between Notti ng ha m

Forest       and Liverpool                  had k i ck e d          off.

At    3.07      p.m.     an     unknown Liverpool                        supporter             came    up     to me          and     t o l d me

that      there       h ad    been a            pitch      i n v a s i o n at           the    Leppings         Lane         end.

Shortly after                t h is    numerous            f a ns    came          into       the    corridor           stating           that

a    couple      of     fans       had      died,       all     these          fans          were    very agitated.

At 3.11         p.m.     more         fans a p p e a r e d          on    the          corridor       and were           very

antagonistic             towards            us    (the      Police),               a    large       number      stating,             " I T ’S

YOUR      FAULT™         Y O U ’R E        D E A D . " and      other          similar          comments.

At    this      poiint we          decided          that      we w e r e           unable       to    pa t r o l    the       corridor

owing      to    the     number            of    f a ns w i s h i n g         to       vent    their     anger          on    us.

I was      in f e a r        for      my    own     personal             safety and             that     of P o l i c e         Constable

1847 Bungay.I                then walked              down      the       ramp          to    the    lowe r     level.

At 3 . 1 3      p.m.     I went            from     the     bottom            of       the    ramp onto         the      playing           area

which      by    this        time      was       quite      crowded.                   I saw    some     Liverpool              fans

struggling            with a          body and a ma keshift                            stretcher        (hoarding)              so       I ran

towards         them and           carried          the     front         left          hand    corner        of    it       ( w hen

facing       them).           I carried             this      body        back          in the       direction           I had           just

come      from and           the      body was          placed           on    the       ground       outside           the     gymnasium

and    left      with        other         officers.

C can o n l y         say      that        the    body was           that          of a m a l e       (well        b ui l t )      and     I

tannot       remember           who        the    officers           were          receiving          the     bodies.

             I then went        back      onto     the    pitch where           I was    me t    with a very            similar

             situation        except      the     person was alive,              male,       about     30 years         and

             aigain,    taken       to   the    area     outside       the     gymgnasium        and     left w i t h

             Ambulance        personnel.

             I then went        back      to    the    playing        a r e a a n d a s s i s t e d a St.       J o h n ’s

             Ambulance        female      carry a young            male      teenager        <16 y e a r s )    who     was

             conscious        and    talking       and    carried        him    into    the a r e a      in f r o n t    of     the

             gym and     sat    him      in s o m e    dry sand w here           the    St.     J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e    girl

             dealt     with    him.

             I was     then    ordered         to s t a n d w i t h    other     officers         in a     cordon across

             the    concrete        area,      effectively         protecting          the    gymnasium area             from

             other     very distre sse d           fans.

             I was     constantly approached                whilst        in this       cordon       by Press',

             relatives,        nurses,         doctors     and     firemen.        Throughout            this     I was        not    in

             possession        of a      personal        radio.

             I can s t a t e    that      throughout         the      incident      I constantly            kept      smelling

             stale     intoxicants.

                  H ac ke n t h o r p e Police Station,        where      I saw my sector         (Serial    Sergeant)

                  Police Sergeant           2279 E d w a r d s .

                  We were       t ra ns p o r t e d to H il l s b o r o u g h Football   Gro u n d by public

                  At     11.00 a.m.      that   day,    I was d e p loyed to the          upper    corridor    on the

                  o rder.

                  The two of us were given duties                    to escort     the money from the          betting

                  booth,       between stairways          ’S' and     "T",   down to the       perimeter      track,

                  a r o un d the    pitch and      into the        players   tunnel      after the kick       off.

                  At 2.25       p.m.    we were    called by a steward to att e n d               in the North

                  S ta n d    (Leppings Lane       end)    to eject a y outh who was              climbing    from the

                  West Stand        into the North Stand.

                  He was taken to           the Po lice Room and s u b s e q u e n t l y      ejected at      the

     ejecting this y outh owing to the fans                     pressing against            the gate.

     E v e n t ua ll y this y ou t h was ejected via a gate to the                    left       of the

     t urnstiles w hen      looking      outward from the ground.                   These       gates were

     immediately       secured a g ain and no awaiting                fans gained          entry at this

     time.

     After the y outh was         ejected we both made               our way back to the                upper

     At 3.00    p.m.    I was aware       that the football             match between N o t t i n g h a m

     Forest and Liverpool          had kicked off.

     At 3.07    p.m. an unknown Liverpool                supporter         came    up to me and told me

     that there    had been a pitch invasion at the Leppings Lane                                 end.

     S h o r t l y after this    numerous       fans    came    into the      corridor          stating        that

     a couple of fans        had died,      all    these       fans were      very agitated.

     At 3.11    p.m.    more fans a p p e a r e d on the           corridor and were             very

     antagonistic       towards    us    (the Police),         a    large    number stating,                " I T ’S

     YOUR FAULT - Y O U ’RE DEAD." and other                   similar      comments.

     At this    point we decided that we were                   unable to         patrol    the       corridor

     owing to the number          of fans wishing          to vent their anger                  on us.

     I was    in fear    for my own       personal       safety and that            of Police C o nstable

     1847 Bungay.I       then wa l k e d down the         ramp to the         lower       level.

     At 3.15    p.m.    I went    from the bottom of the                ramp onto         the    playing area

     w hich by this time was            quite    crowded.          I saw some Liverpool                fans

     s truggling with a body and a mak e s h i f t                 stretcher       (hoarding)          so    I ran

     towards them and        carried the front            left      hand    corner    of    it    (when

     facing them).        I carried this body back                  in the di r e c t i o n      1 had just

     come    from and the body was          placed on the            ground outside             the    gymnasium

     and    left with other       officers.

     I can only say that          the    body was       that    of a male         (well    built)       and      1

     cannot    remember who the officers were                   receiving the bodies.

          I ■then went         back onto the      pitch where     I was met with a very similar

          s i tuation except           the   person was alive,     male,    about 30 years and

          again,       taken to the area outside             the g y mgnasium and     left with

          A mb u l a n c e   personnel.

          I then went          back    to the   playing area and a s s i s t e d a St.       John's

          A m bulance        female    carry a young male teenager          (16 years)       who was

          conscious an d talking and              carried him     into the area       in front       of the

          gym and sat him             in some dry sand where       the St.    J o h n ’s Amb u l a n c e    girl

          dealt with him.

          I was then ordered to stand with other                   officers    in a cordon across

          the    concrete area,          e ff ectively     protecting    the g y mnasium area        from

          other      very d is t r e s s e d fans.

          I was      constantly a p p ro ac he d whilst        in this    cordon by Press,

          relatives,          nurses,    doctors and firemen.           Throughout    this    I was        not    in

          possession of a personal               radio.

          I can state          that    throughout    the    incident    I constantly kept         smelling

          stale      intoxicants.

Thank you for your letter of 7 July. You may
recall that Lord Justice Taylor, in the course
of his visit on 6 July, wondered if it would be
possible to have a note of the standing area
available on the centre court and court No 1.
I subsequently received a telephone call from
someone on behalf of Knight Frank and Rutley,
but we have heard nothing further since then.
I am sorry to trouble you, but I was wondering
if any of the information which Lord Justice
Taylor was seeking was yet to hand. He asked
me about it recently.       w

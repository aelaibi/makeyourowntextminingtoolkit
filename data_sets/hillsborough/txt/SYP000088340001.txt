As     s o o n as      the F ,A.         announced           that       the    semi       final       was    to    be     p l a y e d at

Hillsborough                I knew       t ha t     I would        be    on duty.           It w a s        a big       game     and

1 was         looking        forward          to    it.

On Saturday                the    15th       of A p r i l    1989       (150489),          I reported             for     duty     in

uniform,            at a b o u t       9.30am       (0930)        at Hillsborough.                    The    briefing           was     to

be at         9.45am        (0945).

There? m u s t         h a ve     been about             a thousand           police       officers          in the        stand,

a ll    seated.             I and       the m a j o r i t y       of    the S p e c i a l    Constables             were        r i gh t

at     th e    back, of          the    sta nd .         Consequently,              I found       it v e r y d i f f i c u l t          to

hear     what         was    being       said.           Even when           the    tannoy was          being       used        it w a s

very muffled                by the       t im e     the     sound       reached       the    back.           I wasn't           too

bothered about                   not    being able           to    h ea r     because       I k n e w we w o u l d             have     a

separate            briefing           afterwards.

After         the     briefing,          all       the    specials           went    to    the    gymnasium where                  we

were     divided            into       groups       urytter a S e c t i o n         Officer.           By    this       t i m e we      ha d

We     too‘k up our              positions          about       11.15am        (1115).           Everybody          seemed         to       be

ex’

real      signs        of a n y        trouble.

As     the     time        approached           2.30pm       (1430)          the    general       area a t t h e toP               of

Halifax          Rd    appeared          virtually           f r ee     from       traffic.                                     and

myself         were        therefore          instructed           to    head       back    towards          :,he f o o t b a l l

supporters             in t ha t       area.

A s we        walked       back       towards          the    g r o u n d we      came a c r o s s          several         l a r ge

groups         of L i v e r p o o l        supporters           making        their        way      to    the    ground.            A

lot      of    them       had    obviously             been     drinking          but      their         mood was        l ou d     but

good       natured.             There       was     a good       banter         between          us a n d       them.

On approaching                  the    gym       I was       a m a z e d at     the      size       of    the    crowd

s t il l      outside       the       ground,          e s p e c i a l l y as     the a r e a we           had

previously            been       patrolling             had     seen     such a steady                   f l o w of     people

ar r i v i n g .

1' can        remember          thinking          at    the     time     t h at      there was            no w a y all         these

people were               going       to    get     in the       ground         before          kick      off.It       a m a z e d me

t h at     people were            arriving             so    late,      especially              in v i e w      of    the    ticket

prices         for    the       semi-finals.

A ll     a r o u n d me     everybody             seemed        good     natured,           laughing and               joking           and

the      attitude          towards          the     police       seemed         on     the w h o l e       very

friendly.

Although            the    volume          of    people       in the a r e a           through which                 I was

passing            seemed       gr ea t,        nobody       seemed      particularly                bothered          or    in a n y

real       hurry.

As we         entered       the       gym       I was       relieved      to      get      a drink         and       spoke     to

various            other    officers             asking       generally about                   conditions            in o t h e r

parts         of    the    ground.              It w a s     mentioned          th a t     many      of     the a w a y      fans

were       s t il l   arriving,             e v e n at       t h is    time,      in     l a r ge    numbers,          outside

the      g at e s .       Obviously             having       ha d a fe w        drinks,          which       supported my

own      observations.

Some       officers         also       mentioned             that      many     p a rt s    of      the     ground appeared

quite         empty and were                under       the     impression             t ha t    th e     kick       off m i g h t       w el l

passage          way       in t he N o r t h St/and.                        We    s t o p p e d at         several             gangways

along       the       passage           to m a k e ^ g e n e r a l           observations                  of     the      crowd and

check       to      see      if the S t e w a r d s            needed any                   assistance.

As    we    approached              the       fina l         gangway             leading          into       the N o r t h S t a n d

from       the      Leppings            Ln    turnstiles,                   we    noticed            that       although             nearly

every       other          gangway           only       had a few s up po rt er s                       passing            through,

here       there         seemed         to    be    quite          a    large          build         up.        We    entered             t hi s

gangway and                attempted           to       speak          to    the S t e w a r d w h o              seemed         to       be

ha vi ng a few               problems          in a d v i s i n g            many       fans         who     were         using       the

incorrect             gangway and wouldn't                             easily          be a b l e       to      get       to    their          seats

from       t hi s     po s i t i o n .

However,            as we         tried       to a s s i s t           in t u r n i n g         the     fans         back       down       the         steps

and asking               them      to    distribute                themselves                generally along                     all       the

all      the a p p r o p r i a t e           gangways,             it s o o n          became          obvious            to me       that         it

was      going        to     be    impossible                to get          any       f an s     ba c k     down         the    steps.The

time       was      n ow a b o u t       3.02pm          <1502)             and       the    fa ns      could

obviously             see a n d         hear       t ha t     the       game          had    started and                  I could          sense

t ha t     the      f an s    down       in the          passage were                   frustrated,                  as    they       could            hear

but      couldn't            see    th e m a t c h .           As we w e r e                standing            at    the       top       they         could

see      it w a s        us w h o w e r e          blocking             their          way      to     the      ground and                could         hear

several          general           shouts          of    "push,             push,       push,          get      them       out       of    the w a y ".

They were             shouting           abuse          at    us a n d           I genuinely               feared          for       the       safety

of    the     people          in t ha t        a r e a as w e l l                as    for me          and my         colleague.                   I

could       not       call        for    any       h e l p as          I never          had a          radio.

As    I glanced              towards          the       pitch          to    look       for       help       I s aw w h a t           I thought

at    that       t i m e wa s       crowd          trouble             unfolding             at      the     front         of    the L e p p i n g s

Ln    terrace.               I asked          the S t e w a r d             to a l l o w        t he    supporters               up       through

this       gangway           end    into       the       stand,             to    their         seats        as      best       as    he       could.

However,            as     I turned around                    to       come       up    the       gangway and                  into       the      stand,

I released             the    pressure             w hi ch was         stopping          the       fans    coming            up the

tunnel       and       then     suddenly            found myself              on the          ground as/Xhey                    surged

forwards.              I feared          for       my    life as        everybody             came     cy v e r    the       to p     of me.

I managed          to    scramble             to m y         knees     and    crawled'otli             to the              relative

safety       of    the       s te p s    leading             down    the     stand       to    the     pitch.

Several          people who             had already             taken        their       seats       previously                 came    to m y

assistance             and    got       me    out       of    the w a y      of    the       crowds.

At    this       time    I sa w m y           colleague             emerge        from       the    tunnel         and was

relieved          to    see     he w a s        unharmed.

We    then       decided        to      head       down       to the        pitch       to    observe         the

s i t u a t ion.

On approaching                the       pitch       I c o u l d see          that       something           wass e ri ou sl y

wrong       in the L e p p i n g s           Ln     terrace.            People          were       s p i l l i n g out          of    the

gates       and    climbing             ov er      the       fences.         The    game was           s t il l        going         on at

this    sta ge .         I was          then advised                by a s e n i o r / P o l i ce         officer            (I

don't       know who          he w a s ),          t o form a          line w ^ i iy a f e w           o t he r

officers          between          the       pitch and          the     edge jiff        the       track     whilst             a few

injured          fans who          had       come       out    of    the     v/rrace          were     escorted a w a y .

I stood          facing       the       pens       and       then    became        aware       of    fans         at    the

front       of    the    terrace             being       crushed        up a g a i n s t       the     fence.

People       were       screaming,              "For         God's     sake       help,       don't       just         stand

there,       people          are      dying        d o w n her e ".         .At    this       point       I realised

the    full       horror        of w h a t         was       happening        and       rushed       forwards              to

assist       the       other       officers             who we/e        trying          to h e l p     get        the       fans

out.        I w as      helping          get       the       people who           were       climbing         ov e r        the

top    of    the       fence       from Pen             4 . / They were            shocked and             distressed

and    said       they       f e lt     sick,                tried     to    comfort          them,       the      game         was    s t ill

going       on at       this       sta g e.         I then          saw an        officer          run on a n d

stop    the       game.         I could            see       that    people were              lying       d e a d at         the      frory

of P e n 3 a n d         shouted             for    other       officers           to    help       break         the       fence      tffiwn.

              We    were      trying            to     push      it out          from        our  s i d e a n d t h e f an s i n s i d e w e r e

               I re c a l l       a young            m a le ,    aged about                19 b e i n g      passed         over,        he    c o u l d n ’t

              get      his    breath,            so     I s t o o d wi/£h h i m for                     a minute.             By

              now      the    fence          had      been       ri^i^ed o p e n a n d m o r e                 people were               coming

              onto      the       pitch.             I saw an ambulance                       arrive         which         parked        right

               in f r o n t       of    the      pe n     reducing              the a r e a we           had      to w o r k       in.        We

              ripped         the       goal      net      down        so    that       stretchers              could        be     l a id

              a c ross

              I then went               into P e n 4 w i t h                                            to see         if a n y b o d y

              needed         help.           Some       peo pie we re                complaining             of    lack       of ai r         so we

              sent      them       out       onto       the      pitch.

              I then went               back         o n the      track          to    the      front        of P e n 3.            It w a s         s t il l

              bodies         at    the       fro nt .           Everyone             was     doing       the      b es t    they      could.

              One      lad    came        o ve r      the       top,       he    had a scarf              around           his w r i s t .             I

              helped         him       o v er    but      he w a l k e d         off a c r o s s         the      pitch       before          I couM

              help      him.

bcv                      somebody               passed          to me       from       the      front, / v f       Pen 3 .          He wa s

              ages      and       I was/getting                  no    response.                I shouted              to a      policeman,                whom    I

              don't      know,          "Somebody               h e l p me,          he's     not       breathing".                The      officer          said,

              "Leave         him       love,         h e' s     already          de ad " .         He    then      put a         coat       o ve r     his      face.

              At    this      time        people          were        laying          the a d v e r t i s i n g         boards        down

          I went, b a ck          to    the     fence            and     helped       pull        another                   body                         out.

          were      trying        to    resuscitate                   this man.

          I was      physically            drained and                   c o u l d n ’t lift a n y more.                                                 I walked

          away      to    see     if t h e r e w a s             anything         els e      I could            do.                          I came

          across         another        spectator                w ho w a s     trying         to    revive                      another                             male.

          I d id     the    cardiac            for    h im w h i l s t          he    did      the m o u t h                     to m o u t h .                            It w as

          obvious         after        about        a minute             that     he was          dead.

          I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r       anything               about       his     description.

          By   t his      t ime    the      pens      had         thinned         out       and     the    dead                        bodies                        had

          n e a r l y all       been      r e m oved.

          I then milled about                       talking            to d i f f e r e n t       spectators.                                            I was            very

          upset      and    I think            the    fan s           c o u l d see     this.         I recall                                     one              lad t e l l i n g

          me   he    had    got        in w i t h o u t          a ticket         and several             s h o w e d me                                           full    tickets

          which      still        h ad the          counterfoil               on.

          I stayed         on d u t y u n t i l        about            6pm     (1800)         and    then after                                              a de­

          brief      we w e r e        allowed        to         go    home.

Selwyn's       caMeth tKat      I t ravelled with,

On m atch day,        I left my house wit h my dad,                 who was       driving me to

Anfield,       to the    coach    pick up point.           We     left my house about 9 A „M ,

(0900)     and    picked up              and              on the way to Anfield.                   There was

about     three or four         coaches,       all a pp ea r ed full       of fans       intending         to

travel     to Sheffield,                            and    I all    got on the same            coach and

sat together.

The    coach     left A n fi e ld about        11 AM    (110'd)    or 11.30 AM         < 1 1 3 0 ).     The
                                                           /A
coach was        s u b je ct ed to travel       delay^yon(th^/motorway.

The    coach stopped once only on the way to Sheffield, /far^ this was

about    one mile outside S h ef fi el d w he n the                po1i c e ^ s / | / ^ d    our      coach.

Two    policemen      came     onto our bus and           checked       to see    if(j^Kf the          coach

passengers        had tickets,       w hi ch being w ith an o rganised travel                         club,

they all       had tickets.

Our    coach a r r i v e d    in S h ef fi el d about 2 PM         (1400)      and    parked beside a

long    line of other          coaches,    that had        carried Liverpool             fans.         I d o n ’t

know    the name      of the     road that we          parked     in,    but    it was      on a dual

carriageway,        on a hill.          This    location was about a 13 minute walk                           to

the football        ground.

As    I wa l k e d towards      the ground,       w it h my two friends,              I saw that         the

street was        busy w it h supporters.              The a t mo sp he re was very good and

people were quite             enci te d about     the game.         There were a few uniformed

policemen on the             streets,    who wa l ke d a lo ngside         the body of supporters

towards     the ground.          I saw other        policemen standing at street                       corners,

I saw a few        people drinking,            who ware     outside a pub we w al k ed                 past,

but    there was      no d runkeness       or disorder.

                   and   I w a lk e d d ir ectly to the ground,                arriv in g     outside         the

The weather was          dry and sunny and             it was     quite warm.          I was dr essed              in

people were all              in a solid mass and there was                   nowueues        that you        could

see that were             organised.         There was one mounti                    iceman and another

see that       these       letters were           displayed over         turnstile     entrances,        at    the

right       side    of the ground,           with my two friends             I moved       towards     this

ar e a .

The    crowd quic k l y         built     up outside         the turnstiles         I had            behind me

and                behind him,        and as        I looked back,        I could see a large               build

up of       people       had quic kl y built up behind where we were standing.

Due to the          crowd size,          X was      pushed about a bit,            I was    trying     to stay

together w ith my friends and not to get                             pushed off my feet.             It was

quite       packed outside           in this        crowd.     I d o n ’t remember         seeing    policemen

outside       the turnstiles.

It took about             10 minutes       for m y ^ r o u p    to get      into    the ground.         I

entered through the                proper     tqjfi/£ti 1 e and gave my ticket               to the

turnstile          operator,       who    r e t u r n e d rny ticket     stub to me.

Once       inside    the     turnstile       en/rance,        I was     confronted     by a uniform

p oliceman who            s e a r ch ed m e / /       was    busy    in this area,         but you     could

walk       freely. ____________           [a net/I met up in this area,

Once       together       we headed        towaV^ds a tunnel           leading     to the terracing,

Both               and             had     v isited H i l l s b o ro u gh before and told me that

the tunnel was the way to the terracing.                                I thought     this w/£s the only

way onto       the terracing.             I never      saw any signs di r e ct i n$ / pecvt*Xe/ to the

terracing          by any other          route.       As    I was about      to enter       theT Xi rj^afc e I

saw one       policeman standing                  beside a wall,        outside     the tunnel       entrance.

The    tunnel/fwas/nt too               busy as you first          entered and only got                 busy at

the e;<:M/ Heading           onto       the terracing,       as    I got to the terracing                 I saw a

metal       railing     s eparating        the terracing,          and with my two            friejKfs, we

m o v e d to our       right and         into an area        1 know to be          pen/ nt^fr^Y 3 .           X saw

people       standing      on this        dividing      fence to get a view ^ e r / p e o pi es

heads.         They were      not standing           on top of this            fence     buT on a bar near

the    bottom of the fence.

We three mana ge d           to get       into the terracing             in pen 3, at a position

near half way.             I have        indicated the       position as number               1, on a

separate        grid s h e e t . (Exhibit N o .                ) (Case R e f . No.                  ) and      I

have    signed this        grid         sheet.      The time w ou ld now be             a oth ±£,/2 .4G^i£>m

(1440),         Isaw some of            the   players out on the           pitch        for a war m upT

They had on track suit                  tops.       I remember      seeing Alan H A N S E N of

Liverpool         waving     towards       the Liverpool          fans,       who were     shouting       his

name.

On the terrace            I was     pushed about a fair             bit.        X just thought           it was

like A nf ie ld on a derby day.                     It was   quite       packed.        There was        surging

w it hi n    pen 3 but due to rny central                 position        I was jostled up and down

the terrace.            I was *nt too          concerned.         The    crowd kept getting              tighter

and tighter.            It kept      getting more         packed        in there.        I remember       the

teams       being a n n o u n c e d .     People at the back were                 pushing     forwar d to get

in and       people at       the front were            shouting     out       "MOVE B A C K ” .

Even tu al ly               and     I m an a ge d to move over to our                   right and stay

together.         I looked a ro u nd for                  and I could see               him about 3 rows           in

front       of me.      X spoke      to              and when      I looked back for

c o u l d n ’t see    his head or anything.                             and    I were a couple of steps

in front        of a barrier.             I have     indicated the            position on the same grid

sheet wit h the           number 2.           The   time w ould be 2.5 5           pm    (1455).

It was       becoming      even more          tighter    on the terracing.                I was     still

subject        to surging       in the        crowd.     My feet were           sometimes         off   the

        ground.        I had kept my elbows                  into my sides,          with my arms accross my

        chest.        I suffer         from ASTHMA.           I began to take            deep b r e a t h s .     I was    by

        now frigh te ne d         in this    compacted          crowd.,, I saw people                trying      to climb
                                                                     N - /Is "                     ~
        over    the    perimeter         fencing       but th ey wife         pushed back          into the terrace

        by the Police.

        I saw the teams            come out and             line upJL/1       never      saw the actual           kick-

        off.     I knew the game            had started.              I could not          concentrate        on the

        game    I was more         concerned with what was happening all a ro u nd me.

        I saw a couple            of    people    being       pulled       into the West Stand,             from the

       Leppi ng s Lane           terrace.        I saw other          people      climbing      out of Pen 3 into

       Pen Z r to my right.

       E ve nt u al l y    I saw a gap       in the          crowd to my right.              This may have          been

        caused by fans            climbing       out of       pen 3.                 and    I made our way

       towards        the fence        dividing 3 and           pen 2.        There was        some fella         in pen

       3, who had his hands                cupped to a ll ow            people      to climb out of 3 into                pen

       2.      This man was            telling    people       to calm down.                       went    over    into

        pen 2 and         I f ol lo we d him.          As    I got    in^W P<d\ 2,         the game       had just

       stopped and          I saw the       last of the          piayem          going     off the field down the

       tunnel.

        1n Pen 2, there was big gaps e v e r y w h y / .                      3ft/Was not busy.

                 and      I stayed       in Pen 2., till about e/23                        < 1425)     to 2.30     pm

            pen g r | was          looking       for             but       I could not see him.                 I saw

'<^->^0 Pe ° P ie being       lifted over the fence                  into 2, and over the               perimeter

        fence onto         the    pitch.     I saw the          perimeter         gate     being     opened and fans

        being    passed through the gate onto                        the    pitch.

        I saw unconscious               people    lifted by fans             into     pen 2 from 3.        I saw

        people    lying      on the       pitch,       and    people trying           to revive        them.      I heard

        someone       say "He's         dead him" talking about an                    old fella        lying on the

        pitch.        I c a n ’t remember what               this man       looked like,        I just      remember
                                                                                                      P AGE       <

him being       there.

I c a n ’t remember             individual       victims.

At about 3.2 5            pm    (1525)             and    I went       out the gate of       pen 2,    onto

the    pitch to          look for                 We    looked about       but    c o u l d n ’t find him.

We    could'nt       get       past the half-way          line as the       police were       standing       in

a line accross             that area.        I was given a drink                of water    once on the

pitch.

About 3.45          pm    {1343)             and       I went    back    into    pen 2.     We went    back

onto the       pitch a ga in after           10 minutes          or so.              and    I left

following       the a n no u nc e me n t     that the gates were opened.                    I think    it

would be about 4 pm                (1600).                and    I left    the ground       into    pen 4,

and out through the tunnel.                      The     tunnel was       not    packed,    but    it had a

few    people       in it.        I never saw anyone with                physical     injuries outside

the t u n n e l .

         and    I w a l k ed      back towards          the   coach.      On the walk       to the    coach,

I went    into an electrical                shop and telep ho ne d my             parents.

When             and       I reached our b u s ,                  was sitting       on it waiting       for

us.     About 2 or 3 lads                never    came back to our          coach.        I d o n ’t know who

these    lads were.

As a result          of the football             disaster       that    d % y , ']L had bruises on my

back.
                                                                    1/
I never     lost any time from school                      ,s\-a resuu l r of the disaster.
                                                          as

I never     lost any            property that day.

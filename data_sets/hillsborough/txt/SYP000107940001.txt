POLICE SERGEANT 767




'E 2 1 DIVISION




At 8.45 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Woodseats Police

Station       and    was       transported     to    the       ground    at    Hillsborough    together    with

other officers by bus.                   We arrived at the ground at around 9-30 am.                      I was

 in   charge        of    a    serial     of   ten    men       and    was     immediately    responsible     to

Inspector Booth,              'E2' Division.

A briefing was arranged for 10.00 am and this                                  took place more or less as

scheduled       with          officers    gathered        in     the    North    Stand.       Following    this

briefing all             officers      took a packed meal which I collected for my serial

from the gymnasium.                  I also collected a radio and tickets for a meal which

was to be provided later in the day.

At    about    11.15       am,   my serial,         together with others,              were gathered on the

Spion K o p , where we were again briefed by Superintendent Greenwood as to the

particular      problems             which we were likely to encounter in that part                       of the

ground.       It was the responsibility of these serials to Police this part of

the    ground        for       the    -duration      of    the        match,    with    individual     serials

undertaking specific tasks.

At approximately 11.30 am, as per the instruction of the day, my serial were

deployed      outside          the    ground on Penistone              Road North.        We were   to Police

turnstiles      43 to 54 which gave entrance to the kop.

Throughout      the next few hours we remained at the turnstiles supervising the

entrance of supporters which, as time went on, gradually built up to quite a

large crowd.             Despite this there were no problems with the crowd and apart
from the-'ioddiâ€™ilnj^v'ttr^^apecta'tos.,-&pyiag to gain entrance without                 tickets,

they were very well behaved *and quite jovial.                    It never got to the stage

where the crowd could have been considered uhruly or out of control.

As   the start of the game approached,             I could hear messages over the radio

relating to the other end of the ground but was unaware of any real problem.

However, shortly after the start of the match I received instruction via the

radio for my serial to go onto the playing area.                  I can't remember the exact

content of the message received, but I formed the opinion that spectators at

the Leppings Lane end had invaded the playing area and that reinforcements

were required at that end.             I entered the ground with my serial and went up

to   the side of the kop nearest to the South                   Stand.

On   reaching a position where           I could       see the Leppings      Lane end,    I saw a

large    number    of people      on   the   playing    area,   the game    had obviously, been

stopped and I saw what I first thought to be fighting in and around the goal

mouth area at that end of the ground.              I entered the playing area via a gate

in   the fence at the kop and ran towards the Leppings               Lane    end.     I saw people

still coming over the fence, Police Officers on the                  fence apparently trying

to stop people       coming    over and what appeared           to be skirmishes       in various

parts of the playing area.             Spectators were coming towards me from that end

and I assumed that some of these were attempting to get at the Nottingham

supporters who were on .the kop.              I honestly believed at this time that we

were on the point of having to deal with a major riot.

I also    saw some    people laying on the ground who were obviously suffering

from some distress, but again I thought that they had been hurt as a result

of   fighting     both on   the    terrace    and on     the playing     area.      Messages were

coming over the radio .but there didn't appear to me to be anything that at

this time I could comprehend, it seemed as though everyone wanted to use the
                                                    -    3   -




radio at t k same time.

It must have been a full five minutes before I realised the true nature of

the problem and by this time some of my officers had gone forward to assist

at the fence.         For myself, I helped with the injured giving what first aid I

could and also helped              to carry      some     of      the    injured    to the casualty area

which had been set up at the North East corner of the pitch.                                      I was still

aware    of   the    possibility      of       fighting          breaking   out    between     those     on    the

playing area and those on the kop.                      Many of those who had managed to escape

from    the   Leppings      Lane    terrace were         very       angry   and     abusive    to nobody        in

particular.         Some had been drinking and were, in my view, drunk.                             Some were

so angry and         frustrated     at what       had happened            that     I felt    that they were

itching for a fight and that they did not particularly care who they fought

with.

Once general order had been restored, I gathered my men together and then we

formed part of a cordon that had been placed across the pitch as there still

seemed to be a real danger that rival supporters were ready to clash at the

first opportunity.

When the decision was taken to abandon the game, my serial was instructed to

revert to the arranged schedule and that was to supervise the loading of the

Nottingham     Forest       supporters            onto the transport              that   was    waiting         in

Penistone Road North.          -This was done             with           no problems and          when      finallythe

area    was   clear    we   attended       a    debriefing          in    the    North   Stand.        We     were

eventually stood down at about                 6.30 pm and were returned to Woodseats Police

Station at about 7*15 pm where                  I went off duty.

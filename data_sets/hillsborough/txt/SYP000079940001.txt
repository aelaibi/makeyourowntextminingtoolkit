              I went         down        to    the        front       of    the       stand and                 from       there        I could        see      down

              into       the       standing           area       of L e p p i n g s         Ln        end.           I could           see    the     area      in

              the      centre           was    very        packed          but     there            was        room       out     on    either        side      near

              the      corner           fl ag s,      but       no   one      was      going              to    the       en ds     they were          all      g o in g

              into       the       c entre.           I could          understand why                          this       wa s    happening           because

              when       you       enter       through           the       turnstiles                 the       tunnel           leading       to     this      area

              years      with        f ai r       hair ,    wearing          silver            rinmtf’a g l a s s e s ,            and    a grey

              and      his    glasses             started        to     dnerp off             his       n o s e , the       lad t h e n     dropped              out

              of    sight       into         the    crowd ^nd              I d id      not          see     him again.             He w o u l d      be

              about       two      or     three         fee t     from     the       perimeter               fence         w h e n he     disappeared.

              I saw a         lot       of    other        people          in t r o u b l e          being         cr u s h e d , l a d s , g i r l s       and

              women,         but     the      lad       stuck      in      my memory.

              I started            to     pu 11     p e o p 3.e u p f r o m ^ ftffe t e r r a c e                 most      of     them were          all

               right      but      s om e     were       shockai^and              others            h ad     started          to    go    grey and             blue

              around         the     lips.

              People         moved        bac k     from        the     front        of       the       stand which              allowed        more       r o om

              for      people        to      be    pulled        up.       One       lad w h o           was      pulled         up was     choking              and

              another         was       shouting           and     screaming              for       his      father         wh o    was    still

              also      saw a young                St    Johns        girl      tryingi/Co               climb       into        the     pen over          the

              t im e    but     on      thinking           about        it a f t e r          it    probably           saved        her    from       getting

              crushed.             When       it    became         apparent           what          had      happened            everybody           did

              everything             they         could,        I saw      people             trying         to    rescue          people       on    the

              pitch and            the       only       upsetting          thing          was       photographers                  taking       covers           off

              dead      people          and       taking        pictures.             I saw a sc uff le                     between        the

              photographers                  and    some        people       who     were           stood         n e ar    the     bodies        and      then

              the      Police        intervened.                 Later       I sa w a              lot     of     bodies         in the     f r o nt       of

                   f an s    and    Police,           There          seemed          to    be         .ot    of P o l i c e     in the           g r o u n d at

                   improve.             The    s m al l    gate       in the          perimeter             fence       wasn't        opened          for    s o me

                   time      after       the    crush,          if    this       had       been       opened       before       it m a y         have       saved

                   some      lives.

                   After      t his      I stood          back       and       I could          not    really          believe        what       was

                   happening,            I did      not        want       to    believe          it.        At    about       4.30     pm    (1630)          we

                   left      the    ground.           I he ar d an a n n o uncement                         by K e n n y      DALGLISH           at    about

                   people         who    were     not      needed          to     clear         the    pitch,          there    wa s    a    large

                   response         to    this.

                   I made         my way       back       to    the       bus a n d        in L e p p i n g s      Ln     there       was    Police

                   the      match.        We    then went             to       the m i n i       bus       and    rang m y w i f e          to    tell       her

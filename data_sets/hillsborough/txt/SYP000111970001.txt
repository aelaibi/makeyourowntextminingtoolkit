Two or three               spectators        { p r e s u m a b l y Liverpool)      made their wa y from

to calm the               situation.         Our a c t i o n s    had no effect.

I became aware                 of    persons,      obviously       injured,     being      carried on

saw three              or four       persons     obviously        in trauma on the gr o u n d w i t h the

organ i s i n g a cordon           of officers         across the breadth of                the     pitch.        I

jo i n e d in that task           to prevent a ny f u r t h e r m o v e m e n t        of fans and

reduce the        potential         disorder.

■I conferred wit h              Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit, a d v i s e d h i m about            the

steps taken to cont a i n the S p i o n Ko p end and,                         as further

reinforcements,            Called for Dog H a n d l e r s            to    come on to the          pitch a t

At this      time a number             of    casualties were          being f u n n e l l e d t h r o u g h the

equally      clear       that    the m aj o r i t y of     people         in the   lower     ends      of the

N o r t h and S o u t h Stands and p r e s u m a b l y the whole S p i o n Kop,                      had    little

centre of the field.                   I was    told by Mr J a c k s o n that there were major

casualties        in a n d a r o u n d the L e p p i n g s Lane           end including a number of

10.45/10.50 am - Left Hillsborough Stadium in a Police Land Rover driven by PC

Buxton (FI) and travelled the main routes into the ground for Nottingham Forest

Supporters - Fir Vale - Neepsend.



Visited Chief Inspectors and Serial Inspectors under my canmand to ensure that

all were in place and aware of their duties and responsibilities.



Remained operational visiting different locations and monitoring the build up of

supporters on route to the ground, paying particular attention to Licensed

Premises.



On three occasions between 11.00 a.m. and 2.00 p.m. (approximately) attended at

the Five Arches public house, Southey, where there was a heavy concentration of

Nottingham Forest Supporters.   Advised ground control of the situation and

requested passing attention by the Southey mobile (Tango 8).    Instructed

Inspector Bateman (C), the Sub-Sector Canmander, to maintain a police presence

at the premises to monitor and prevent any disorder.



Approximately 2.10 p.m. attended the Royal Public house at Owlerton in response

to radio transmissions about public order problems.    The premises had, however,

been closed prior to my arrival and Chief Inspector Price was present and in

control of the situation.



Approximately 2.30 pm   - to Herries Road following reports that some private

coaches containing Nottingham Forest supporters were de-busing in the road and

not at the Bus Depot.   Remained in that locality and at approximately

2.45/2.50?. PC Buxton indicated he had received a radio message instructing him
.i




 Page 3


 to take the Land Rover and use the P.A. system to alleviate congestion in

 Leppings Lane.



 Remained in Herries Road and subsequently heard a number of radio transmissions

 (perhaps two or three) about problems with fans in Leppings Lane. The radio

 reception was poor and broken and there was no clear indication of what the

 problem was.     There were then 2? further transmissions obviously from an officer

     'on the ground1 making a plea for a gate(s) to be opened. It was not clear to

 which gate or gates the messages referred.



 I made my way towards the ground along Herries Road and Herries Road South

 monitoring the flow of Nottingham Forest fans which had thinned considerably.

 There was little evidence of congestion in Penistone Road North.



 At approximately 3.05 pm? I was in Herries Road South near to the junction with

 Penistone Road North listening to radio transmissions.      The transmissions were

 badly distorted, but it was apparent that problems were being experienced at the

 Leppings Lane end of the ground.      Problems which I presumed were ones of

 disorder.



 At 3.08/3.10 pm? I received a radio transmission directing all officers to enter

     the ground. I made my way towards 'O' Gate, Penistone Road North, and saw a

 number of serials entering 'O' Gate as I approached.      I also saw Inspector BOOTH

     (E Div) making his way to 'O' Gate.



 From 'O' Gate I went to the access area between the North Stand and the Spion

 Kop and then onto the perimeter track.      I looked towards the Leppings Lane end
Page 4


and saw a heavy contingent of Police Officers containing what I thought was some

form of pitch invasion and disorder.   Many more Police Officers were converging

at that location.



I observed the Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Kop and it was

imnediately apparent that their mood was hostile with supporters chanting,

clapping and making violent gestures directed toward the Leppings Lane end.

There was only a handful of officers at the far end of the perimeter track

(South Stand end) and I concluded that it was necessary to retain a contingent

of officers at the Spion Kop end to defuse the situation and prevent any

possibility of a pitch invasion from the Spion Kop end.   I signalled officers on

to the perimeter track and formed a line in front of the Kop facing the fans in

order to contain the situation.   The atmosphere was 'electric' and the noise

levels such that I could not hear any clear radio messages other than

intermittent and distorted transmissions.



Two or three spectators (presumably Liverpool) made their way from the Leppings

Lane end toward the Spion Kop gesticulating and provoking a similar and very

hostile response from supporters on the Kop.   I detailed officers to usher them

back towards the Leppings Lane end.



I was joined by a person who identified himself as the 'Ccranercial Agent' for

Nottingham Forest and together we walked up and down the perimeter track

signalling to spectators in the Kop in an attempt to calm the situation. Our

actions had no effect.



I became aware of persons, obviously injured, being carried on stretchers to the
Page 5


corner of the pitch near to the access route between the North Stand and Spion

Kop.     I went to that location and saw three or four persons obviously in trauma

on the ground with the 'carriers' rendering first aid and attempting

resuscitation.    Other stretcher carriers were making their way towards the same

location and attempts were made to channel them out of the ground toward the

gymnasium behind the North Stand. I also recall an ambulance making its way on

to the pitch from the access area between the North Stand and Spion Kop.



Whilst these activities were ongoing fans in the Spion Kop were clapping and

cheering, but I cannot say whether their actions were intended to be derisory or

an expression of appreciation for those engaged with casualties. Nevertheless

their actions seemed to provoke a surge of Liverpool supporters from the

Leppings Lane end and large numbers advanced towards the Spion Kop with Police

Officers from the Leppings Lane end moving to contain the surge.



The Liverpool supporters were gradually ushered back toward the centre of the

ground where I saw Chief Superintendent NESBITT organising a cordon of officers

across the breadth of the pitch.     I joined in that task to prevent any further

movement of fans and reduce the potential for disorder.



I conferred with Chief Superintendent NESBITT, advised him about the steps taken

to contain the Spion Kop end and, as further reinforcements, called for dog

handlers to come on to the pitch at the Spion Kop end to prevent any possible

pitch invasion.



At this time a number of casualties were being funnelled through the cordon and

I was becoming more and more aware of the scale of the incident and the fact
Page 6


that their were several fatalities.    It was equally clear that the majority of

people in the lower ends of the North and South Stands and presumably the whole

of the Spion Kop had little true perception of what had happened.



I saw the ACC Operations, Mr JACKSON, on the pitch and conferred with him and

Chief Superintendent NESBITT, in the centre of the field.    I was told by Mr

JACKSON that there were major casualties in and around the Leppings Lane end

including a number of fatalities and he stressed the need to preserve order and

allow casualties to be removed from the ground.    I was detailed by Mr JACKSON to

maintain the central cordon, prevent disorder and attempt to calm the situation.



It was either at this stage or shortly after a radio transmission was passed to

Ground Control by myself/Chief Superintendent NESBITT? requesting a public

announcement to assist the crowd's understanding of the incident and appealing

for calm.



The scene at the Leppings Lane end was one of confusion with hundreds of people

spread across the breadth of the pitch completely obscuring the terraces.^.

Civilians, Police Officers and St. Johns Ambulance officers were assisting and

resuscitating injured persons. Groups of Liverpool supporters were milling

around amongst the casualties many approaching the cordon obviously traumatised

and displaying a mixture of grief and anger. I approached several groups

attempting to calm the situation and requesting that they move to the outer

perimeter tracks. Many were receptive, but others vented their grief/anger by

hurling abuse at the Police, Nottingham Forest fans and the Sheffield Wednesday

Club.    Many of those spoken to had quite clearly been drinking.
Page 7


The atmosphere gradually calmed after public announcements were made to the

crowd, one of vtfrich declared the match abandoned and sought assistance from

spectators in maintaining calm.   Shortly after this announcement there was a

noticeable drift away from the Spion Kop end as Nottingham Forest fans left the

ground.



Chief Superintendent NESBITT gave an instruction that the cordon of Police

Officers in the centre of the pitch should be reduced by half, one half

remaining as a cordon and the other half exiting into Penistone Road North to

supervise the dispersal of Nottingham Forest fans.   Chief Superintendent NESBITT

remained with the cordon and I left the ground to supervise the dispersal of

Nottingahm Forest fans.   I was joined in that task by Chief Inspector BEAL(FI)

and Inspector WALLACE (E).   The Nottingham Forest fans dispersed orderly by

service buses and private coaches and once it was clear that there was no risk

of disorder I returned to the ground and sought further instructions from Ground

Control.   I was requested to 'stand by' at the rear of the North Stand.



I visited the gymnasium where I saw rows of bodies laid out on the floor, each

supervised by a Police Officer.   This was the first time I fully realised the

extent and magnitude of what had happened.    A number of officers who were with

the bodies were clearly distressed (some of them my own F2 officers - PC's 2963

Singh, 2902 Roberts and 1124 Pratt) and I spent time counselling them and

enquiring about their welfare. I then went into the North Stand where in

conjunction with Superintendent GREENWOOD and Inspector SYKES I spoke with many

other officers who were clearly in a state of shock, again counselling the

officers and ensuring their needs were met.

         At a later stage in response to a radio message I met other Senior Officers at

         Ground Control.      Chief Superintendent MOLE (B) was present and he requested that

             I, together with Chief Superintendent GREENWOOD and Inspector SYKES should go to

         Claywheels Lane (The 'stand down' and Departure Point) and the Niagara Social

         Club to look after the welfare of any officers still at those locations.      I

             remained engaged in that task until 11.45 pm when instructions were received to

             'stand down'.



         From entering the Hillsborough Stadium at 3.08/3.10 pm? to leaving and

             supervising the dispersal of Nottingham Forest fans at 3.50/4.00 pm? I have no

             accurate recollection of times associated with the sequences described.



         NB:

         My original de-brief notes were completed on 16th April 1989 and are retained by

         me.



         Nty original briefing notes were submitted to the Major Incident Room on the 18th

         April 1989 and a copy has been retained by me.

and    in control         of the situation.

At 'approximately 2 .3 0               pip I went      to Herr i e s Road following              reports

that    private         coaches       containing N o t t i n g h a m Forest suppo rt er s were

I remained          in Herries         Road and s u bs e qu e nt l y heard a number               of   radio

t ransrnissions           (perhaps       two or three)         concerning        problems wit h fans           in

no clear        indi c a t i on       of what    the    problem was.        There was       then one or

possi b l y     two      further       t ra ns mi ss io ns   from an officer         "on the      ground"

making a        plea for agate             or gates      (Reception        was    not    clear    enough to

d et ermine which)             to be opened.

I made my way towards                  the ground along Herries Road and Herr ies                        Road

S ou t h m o n i t o ri n g    the flow of N o t t i n g h a m Forest        fans' w h i c h 4iad thinned

cons i d e r a b l y .     There was        little     evidence      of   congestion       in Penistone

R oad N o r t h ,

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.0 5     pm I was      in Herr i e s Rod S o u th near           to the

j u n c t i o n w ith P e ni st on e Roa d N or th           listening     to radio transmissions.

The    t r a n s mi s si on s were       badly distorted,           but   I heard m e n t i o n of

L e p p i n g s Lane and        b ac kg r ou n d noises w hi ch S u g g e s t e d that         there were

possible       problems         of disorder at the L ep pi ng s Lane                 end of      the ground.

At 3 . 0 8 / 3 . 1 0     pm I received a radio               t r a n s m i ss i on d irecting all

officers       to enter         the    ground.       I made my way towards               ' 0 ” Gate,

Pen i s t o n e R oad North,           and saw a number           of serials       entering       ’O ’ Gate

as    I approached.              I also saw       Inspector B O OT H     (E Div)   making     his way

to    ’O ’ G a t © ,

From     ’G* Gate        I went      to the access area between the N orth S ta nd and

the S pi o n H op and then onto the                  perimeter        track.     I looked towards

the' L ep pings Lane             end and saw a h eavy          contingent       of Police Officers

containing what a p p ea r ed             to be some         form of    pitch    invasion and

disorder.         M an y more Police O ff icers               were    converging at that       location.

I o bs erved the N o tt i n g h a m Forest             suppo rt er s    on the S pi on Kop and        it

was    i m m e diately a pp arent          that    their m ood was       hostile with supporters

chanting,        clapping and making               violent     gestures    d ir ec t ed toward the

Le ppings Lane           end.      There was only a handful              of officers at       the far

end of the        perimeter          track    (South S tand end)         and    I concluded that        it

was    n e cessary        to    retain a .c on ti n ge n t    of officers at       the S pi on Kop end

to defuse       the      sit ua ti on and      prevent       any   p ossibility of a pitch

invasion.         1 s i gn al le d      officers     on to the        perimeter    track and       formed

a line      in front           of the K op facing         the fans     in order    to contain the

situation.             The a mt m os p he r e was     ’e l e c t r i c ’ and the noise     levels    such

that     I could not hear any                clear   radio m es sages      other    than

intermittent and d istort ed                  transmissions.

Two    or three         spec ta to rs     (presumably Liverpool)           made    their way from

the L e p p i n g s ,Lane        end toward the S pi on Kop g es ti cu la ti ng and

provoking a similar and very hostile                          response from suppo rt er s          on the

Kop.      I. d et ai l ed officers           to usher     them back towards         the L ep pings

Lane    end.

I was joined by a peson who                    ident if ie d himself as the          ’C ommercial

Agent*     for N o t t i n g h a m Forest and together we wa lk ed up and down the

perimeter       track          s ignalling    to spec ta to rs       in the K op   in an at te mp t     to

calm the situation.                  Our actions      had no effect.

I became aware             of persons,        obviously, injured,         being    carried on

s tretchers       to the         corner   of the     pitch near        to the access       route

between the N o r t h S ta nd and S pion Hop.                       I went        to that    location and

saw three         or four    persons        o bviously       in trauma on the ground with the

"carriers'         r e ndering first aid and a tt em p ti n g                    resuscitation.       Other

stretcher         carriers were ma ki ng their w ay towards                         the same    location and

at tempts were made              to, channel      them out of the ground ‘to wa rd the

g ym n as i um be hi nd the N orth Stand.                  I also         recall an a m bu la nc e making

its way on to the            pitch from the access                  a rea between the North Stand

an d S pion Hop.

Whilst      these a c t i v i t i e s were ongoing             fans       in the S pi on K op were

clapping and         cheering,        but    I cannot say whether                  their actions were

intended to be d er is or y or an e xp re s si o n of a p p r e c i at i on                    for    those

engaged wit h        casualties.            N e ve r th e le s s    their actions       seemed to

provoke a surge            of Liverpool          suppo rt er s       from the Leppings Lane             end

and large         numbers    a dv an c ed towards          the S pion Kop with Police O ff icers

from the L ep pi ng s Lane            end moving to            contain the          surge.

The Liverpool            supp or te rs were        g r ad ua ll y ushered back toward the

centre      of the ground where               I saw Chief S up e ri n te n de n t NE'SBXT

organ is in g a cordon Of officers across                           the breadth of th&          pitch.        I

joined      in that       task    to prevent any further movement                      of fans and

reduce      the    potential       for disorder.

I conferred w ith Chief S up e ri n te n de n t NESBIT,                          advi se d him about     the

steps    taken      to    contain the S pi on Kop end,                    and,    as further

reinforcements,            called for dog handlers                   to    come on to the       pitch at

the S pi on Kop end to             prevent any          possible          pitch    invasion.

At this      time a number          of   casualties were              being fu nn el le d      th ro ug h the

cordon and         I was    becoming more and more                   awaire of the      scale    of the,

incident and the            fact     that    their were            several       fatalities.     It was

equa ll y    clear that          the m aj or i ty of       people         in the    lower ends       of the

N o r t h and S o u t h Stands and           p r es um ab ly the whole             of the S p io n Kop had

the    c r o w d ’s u n d e rs t an d in g      of the       incident and a pp e al i ng        for    calm.

The    scene at         the L ep pi ng s Lane           end was     one of confusion with hundreds

of    people sp r ea d across                 the   breadth of the        pitch     compl et el y obscuring

the    terraces.             Civilians,         Police       O ff ic er s and St.    Johns A mbulance

o fficers       were a ss i st i ng           and resus ci ta ti ng      injured     persons.          Groups     of

Liverpool          s up p or te rs were milling a r o u nd amongst                  the     casualties many

a pp r o a c h i n g   the     cordon obviously              in trauma and disp la yi ng a mixture

of grief and anger.                     I a pp ro a ch e d    several    groups a tt em p ti n g       to calm

the    sit u a ti on and          requesting          that    they move    to the outer           perimeter

tracks.         Most were           receptive,         but    certain    individuals         proved

vocif e r o u s and made abus iv e                  comments about        the Police,         S h e f f i el d

W e d n e s d a y C lub and N o tt i n g h a m Forest            fans.     I part ic ul ar ly r e ca l l         one

shouting        "It's yo u bastards,                  you    caused this."        He was      physically

r estraind by two               of his friends who              indicated that he was              "talking       in

ushering        him a way towards               the    perimeter     track.

 SUPERINTENDENT CHAPMAN - DAVID        ^ T0piS^^ET^R - Subri3JA4-s4oxrat Commander - F2

 Sub-Division ECCLESFIELD.



 I am a Superintendent in the South Yorkshir^.JiUJU5®”-arR3’”currently hold the post

 of Sub-divisional Commander at F2 Sub-Division, Ecclesfield.



 I have completed ten years in the rank of Superintendent, two of which (1981/2)

 were at FI sub-division, Hammerton Road, where I was responsible for policing

 Hillsborough Football Ground.     I have also undertaken command responsibilities

 in respect of previous F.A. Cup semi-finals held at Hillsborough in 1987 and

 1988.



 In connection with the 1989 F.A. Cup sem -final, scheduled to take place on the

y^sth April 1989 at Hillsborough, I was D es ig n a ted Sector 3 Corrmand - Nottingham

 Forest - The same area of command I helc: in 1987 and 1988.          Operational Order

 Fl/89 (produced) describes in full my an:a of command.



 In preparation for the 1989 F.A. Cup serT;: - f i n a l I attended pre-match meetings on

 the 22nd March and 10th of April 1989 held at Hammerton Road Police Station, and

 a pre-match briefing held on the 14th April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.



 At the pre-match briefing I spoke col lee:ively and individually to all Chief

 Inspectors and Inspectors under my command and also Inspector DAVIS(Mounted

 Branch) advising them of their specific responsibilities,, highlighting potential

 difficulties, and clarifying any areas of doubt.          I then toured those areas of

 Sector 3 immediately around the stadium with my officers to familiarise than

 with the locality and reinforce the instructions previously given(Briefing notes

 produced).

On Saturday the 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 8.15 am at Ecclesfield

Police Station and then with Chief Inspector SUMNER I was conveyed to the

Hillsborough ground.in a Police Land Rover driven by PC 1863 Buxton (FI).

At 10 am I attended the main briefing in the North Stand which was addressed by

  Lef Superintendent DUCKENFIELD (Overall Caimand) Superintendent MURRAY(Ground

At approximately 10.45/10.50 am I left       llsborough Stadium in a Police Land

Rover driven by PC Buxton, and travelle:     the main routes into the ground for

Nottingham Forest Supporters, visiting F.~ Vale and Neepsend. I then visited the

Chief Inspectors and Serial Inspectors v ier my command to ensure that all were

in place and aware of their duties and r- ponsibilities.



I remained operational visiting differer     locations and monitoring the build up

of' supporters on route to the ground,-p-'   ng particular attention to Licensed

Premises.



   three occasions between 11.00 a.m. ar:    2.00 p.m. I attended at the Five

Arches public house, Southey, where the?^ was a heavy concentration of

Nottingham Forest Supporters. I advised      ound control of the situation and

requested passing attention by the South’
                                        ,y mobile (Tango 8). I also

At approximately 2.10 p.m.    I attended the Royal Public house at Owlerton in
     .....      I                  '                                               '■
response to radio transmissions indicating that public order problems were being

experienced.   The premises had, however, been closed prior to my arrival and

Chief Inspector Price was present and in control of the situation.



 t approximately 2.30 pm     I went to Herries Road following reports that private

coaches containing Nottingham Forest supporters were de-busing in the road and

not at the Bus Depot.   J remained in that locality when at approximately

2.45/2.50, PC Buxton indicated he had received a radio message instructing him.

-fo take the Land Rover and use the P.A. system to alleviate congestion in
        ■*■- ■
Leppings Lane. The officer was released to undertake that task.



I remained in Herries Road and subseque: ;ly heard a number of radio

transmissions (perhaps two or three) concerning problems with fans in Leppings

Lane. The radio reception was poor and broken and there was no clear indication

of what   the problem was. There was then    ne or possibly 2   further transmissions

from an   offficer 'on the ground' makii:c   plea for a gate or gates (Reception

was not   clear enough to determine which    to be opened.



I made my way towards the ground along h:-rries Road and Herries Road South

monitoring the flow-of Nottingham Fores i !ans which had thinned considerably." ..

There was little evidence of congestion :n Penistone Road North.



At approximately 3.05 pm I was in Herrie- Road South near to the junction with

Penistone Road North listening to radio :ransmissions.       The transmissions were

badly distorted, but I heard mention of Leppings Lane and background noises

which suggested that there were possible problems of disorder at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.



  "3.08/3.10 pm I received a radio transmission directing all officers to enter
                       -
the ground. I made my way towards 'O' Gate, Penistone Road North, and saw a

number of serials entering 'O' Gate as I approached.    I also saw Inspector BOOTH

(E Div) making his way to 'O' Gate.



Fran 'O' Gate I went to the access area between the North Stand and the Spion

Kop and then onto the perimeter track.    I looked towards the Leppings Lane end

and saw a heavy contingent of Police Officers containing what appeared to be

some form of pitch invasion and disorder.    Many more Police Officers were

converging at that location.



 I observed the Nottingham Forest supporters on the Spion Kop and it was

 immediately apparent that their mood was hostile with supporters chanting,

clapping and making violent gestures directed toward the Leppings Lane end.

There was only a handful of officers at the far end of the perimeter track

 (South Stand end) and I concluded that- it was necessary to retain a contingent

 of officers at the Spion Kop end to defuse the situation and prevent any

possibility of a pitch invasion.      I signalled officers on to the perimeter

 track and formed a line in front of the Kop facing the fans in order to contain

 the situation.   The atmosphere was 'electric' and the noise levels such that I

 could not hear any clear radio messages other than intermittent and distorted

 transmissions.



 wo or three spectators (presumably Liverpool) made their way from the Leppings

 Lane end toward the Spion Kop gesticulating and provoking a similar and very

 hostile response from supporters on the Kop.    I detailed officers to usher them
5/cont



back towards the Leppings Lane end.



I was joined by a person who identified himself as the 'Commercial Agent' for

Nottingham Forest and together we walked up and down the perimeter track

signalling to spectators in the Kop in an attempt to calm the situation. Our

actions had no effect.



I became aware of persons, obviously injured, being carried on stretchers to the

corner of the pitch near to the access route between the North Stand and Spion

Kop.     I went to that location and saw three or four persons obviously in trauma

on the ground with the 'carriers' rendering first aid and attempting

resuscitation.    Other stretcher carrier*, were making their way towards the same

location and attempts were made to channt i them out of the ground toward the

gymnasium behind the North Stand. I alsc -ecall an ambulance making its way on

to the pitch from the access area betwet:    the North Stand and Spion Kop.



Whilst these activities were ongoing f^r     in tht3 Spion Kop were clapping and

cheering, but I cannot say whether their     :tions were intended to be derisory or

an expression of appreciation for those r gaged with casualties. Nevertheless

their actions seemed to provoke a surer      Liverpool.supporters from.the _

Leppings Lane end and large numbers ariva; sd towards the Spion Kop with Police

Officers from the Leppings Lane end movir    to contain the surge.



The Liverpool supporters were gradually ushered back toward the centre of the

gnound where I saw Chief Superintendent NESBITT organising a cordon of officers

across the breadth of the pitch.    I joined in that task to prevent any further

movement of fans and reduce the potential for disorder.

I conferred with Chief Superintendent NESBITT, advised him about the steps taken

to contain the Spion Kop end and, as further reinforcements, called for dog

handlers to cane on to the pitch at the Spion Kop end to prevent any possible

pitch invasion.



At this time a number of casualties were being funnelled through the cordon and

I was becoming more and more aware of the scale of the incident and the fact

that their were several fatalities.    It was equally clear that the majority of

people in the lower ends of the North and South Stands and presumably the whole

of the Spion Kop had little true perception of what had happened.



I saw the ACC Operations, Mr.JACKSON, on the pitch and conferred with him and

Chief Superintendent NESBITT, in the centre of the field. I was told     by Mr

JACKSON that there were major casualties in   and around the Leppings Lane end

including a number of fatalities and he stressed the need to preserve order and

allow casualties to be removed from the ground.    I was dfitailed by Mr JACKSCN to

     ain the central cordon, prevent disorder and attempt to calm the situation.



It was either at this stage or shortly after, following consultation1 between-

myself and Chief Superintendent NESBITT, a radio message was passed to Ground

Control requesting a public announcement to assist the crowd's understanding of

the incident and appealing for calm.



The scene at the Leppings Lane end was one of confusion with hundreds    of people

spread across the breadth of the pitch completely obscuring the terraces.

Civilians, Police Officers and St. Johns Ambulance officers were assisting and



                                                       cont....

resuscitating injured persons. Groups of Liverpool supporters were milling

around amongst the casualties many approaching the cordon obviously in trauma

and displaying a mixture of grief and anger. I approached several groups

attempting to calm the situation and requesting that they move to the outer

perimeter tracks. Most were receptive, but certain individuals proved vociferous

and made abusive comments about the Police, Sheffield Wednesday Club and

Nottingham Forest fans.     I particularly recall one group of four young men, one

of whom repeatedly directed abuse at me shouting, "It's you bastards, you caused

tjais". He was physically restrained by two of his friends w'ho indicated that he

- w a s j j ^ m n & in drink1.(C ommen ts which confirmed my own observations of the

individuals condition).     They then helped to defuse the situation by ushering

him awav toward the perimiter track.



The atmosphere gradually calmed after public announcements were made to the

crowd, one of w'hich declared the match abandoned.       Shortly after this

announcement there was a noticeable drift away from the Spion Kop end as

Nottingham Forest fans left the ground.



Chief Superintendent NESBITT gave an instruction that the cordon of Police

Officers in the centre of the pitch should be reduced by half, one half

remaining as a cordon and the other half exiting into Penistone Road North to

supervise the dispersal of Nottingham Forest fans.        Chief Superintendent NESBITT

remained with the cordon and I left the ground to supervise the dispersal of

Nottingham Forest fans.     I was joined ir that task by Chief Inspector BEAL(Fl)

and Inspector WALLACE (E).     The Nottingham Forest fans dispersed orderly by

service buses and private coaches and once it was clear that there was no risk

of disorder 1 returned to the ground and sought further instructions from Ground

Control.   I wras requested to 'stand by' at the rear of the North Stand.

 I visited the gymnasium where I saw rows of bodies laid out on the floor, each

 supervised by a Police Officer.   This was the first time I fully realised the

 extent and magnitude of what had happened.    A number of officers who were with

 the bodies were clearly distressed (some of them my own F2 officers - PC's 2963

 Singh, 2902 Roberts and 1124 Pratt) and I spent time counselling them and

 enquiring about their welfare. I then went into the North Stand where in

 conjunction with Superintendent GREENWOOD and Inspector SYKES I spoke with many

 other officers who were clearly in a state of shock, again counselling the

 officers and ensuring their needs were met.



 At a later stage in response to a radio message I met other Senior Officers at

 Ground Control.   Chief Superintendent N?' -E (B) was present and he requested that

  I, together with Superintendent GREENWOC    and Inspector SYKES should go to

 Claywheels Lane (The 'stand down' and I> arture Point) and the Niagara Social

 Club to look after the welfare of any o' Leers still at those locations.        I

 remained engaged in that task until II.-     pm when instructions were received to

  'stand down'.



 From entering the Hillsborough Stadium c     3.08/3.10 pm to leaving and

 supervising the dispersal of Nottinghsr.i ■ irest fans at 3.50/4.00 pm I have no

 precise recollection of times associatec     ith the sequences described.

               Working Party' meeting connected with the Safety of Sports Ground Act

               1975.



               The subject of the meeting was Hillsborough Football Ground and its

               purpose was to consider the proposed erection of radial barriers on

               the West terrace for improved crowd control.



               I have had the opportunity of reading the notes of that meeting

               (produced) and would make the following observations.

Continuation of statement of    David Christopher Peter Chapman



The police participants were primarily concerned with the improved

crowd control facilities that the radial fencing would provide,

particularly in the light of,serious problems previously experienced

 in segregating opposing factions on the terraces.



Whilst I do not recall specific details of the discussions there was

 certainly no proposal or acceptance that the police would 'man' the

 gates at the rear of the radial barriers to facilitate emergency

 evacuation.    Rather, an understanding that the Police needed to

 exercise control of gates at the rear of the pens for public order

 purposes.     Examples of this are - To isolate a pen or pens and retain

 others as sterile areas or - To allow speedy access into pens by

 Police Officers to deal with outbreaks of disorder.

 The Chairman opened the meeting by. stating its intention of assessing the
 planning, action and incidents relating to the FA Cup Semi-Final between
 Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers held at Hillsborough on
 Saturday 11 April 1981.

 Certain problems had occurred but in his and the Chief Constable's opinion
 ve had acted corrsctly. One letter of complaint had been received from a member
 of the public as well as one letter praising the police action in a dangerous
 situation. Chief Superintendent Herold mentioned that other letters
 congratulating the police on their actions had also been received.

Mr Goslin said that it was his decision to remove spectators from the Lenpings
Lane end of the ground to the other side in order to ease a dangerous situation
where serious injuries or even fatalities were a real possibility. He then
read the letter of complaint, which contained an allegation that the police
herded more and more people into the Leppings Lane enclosure when it was obvious
that it was full.                             •

The Chairman invited views on this point. Superintendent Chapman said that the
entrances to Leppings Lane were controlled to ensure an even distribution of
fans. However, as the gorund filled up the usual packing problems occurred.
There was space in 'the centre of the enclosure but fans refused to move over
and fill it. Police officers were placed into the crowd to ensure that the
best use was made of the available space. The Mounted Department also assisted
at the- rear of the crowd to prevent more people entering that part of the
ground.

Chief Superintendent Herold pointed out that the problem was exacerbated by a
series of incidents which culminated in the -late arrival of a large number of
fans. This meant that instead of arriving over a period’ , they all -arrived
together very close to kick-off time.

At 11.25 am an accident occurred on the Ml Motorway involving 13 cars, causing
two of the three lanes to be closed down for one and a half hours. Just n o r t h
°f this, and at about the same time, a PSV broke down. Passengers alighted from

                                                                     Continued/.

 DAVID CHRISTOPHER PETER CHAPMAN   -   Superintendent - South Yorkshire Police



 Further to my previous statement, on 21 June 1982 I "handed over" Sub-Divisional

 responsibilities at Hammerton Road Police Station to Superintendent Locke on my

 transfer to duties as Divisional Detective Superintendent.



 I have a pocket book entry concerning the "hand-over" and during my conversation

 with Superintendent Locke I discussed all matters relating to Sub-Divisional

 policing including those concerning Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.



 I can state emphatically that there was not in existence at that time an agreement

 between the Club and the Police that the police assumed responsibility for all

 aspects concerning the Leppings Lane Terraces at Hillsborough Stadium.   I can also

 state that this did not form part of my discussions with Superintendent Locke.



At that time the stewards had a role in that and all other areas of the football

ground and the police had never agreed to relieve them of their responsibilities.



On taking up my post as Divisional Detective Superintendent my efforts were

concentrated on crime committed within the Division and very soon I was engaged on a

murder enquiry.




I have no recollection of attending a meeting with Superintendent Locke and Mr

England, then the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club prior to Sheffield

Wednesday playing Leeds United on the 11 September 1982.   Had I attended such a

meeting I would have made a pocket book entry regarding same, no such pocket book

entry has been made.

a c c or d i n g    to the nature and number                 of visiting        supporters.          For

example,           if there were a number of s up po rt er s                  that      could be

accommodated             in a single         enclosure       then they w ould be a l l o t t e d and

di re ct e d towards           one of the outer            pens,    the    centre       pens w ou ld be       left

empty as a sterile a rea and the other                            outer    pen w ould be des ignat ed

for home           suppo rt er s     <this was       in the      era before       the    centre     pen was

split      further        into two separate            enclosures).



In carrying             out   this    policy,      police o ff icers w ould be d ep lo ye d to the

turnstile area and to the                     concourse       betw ee n the turnstiles and the

stand at L ep pings Lane,                to separate a nd keep apart                    the opposing

factions           of supporters.            The   fans w o ul d be directed by police and

stewards           into their        respective       enclosures.          A further       contingent         of

police       officers w o ul d         be d ep loyed to the sterile area betw ee n the two

sets of s upporters                to m a i nt a in order.         This     contingent w ou ld         be

issued wit h a key to the gates                       in the      radial      fences     so they      could

gain access             to either      of the      populated enclosures              to deal wi t h

disorder.             There w o ul d be neither            police     officers       nor stewar ds          on the

terraces w ith the s upporters as a ma tt er                          of    course.



The whole           basis     of my deployment          of    police       officers at the West End,

an d Lepping Lane Terraces,                    was    intended      to deal w ith the            s eg r eg a ti o n

of opposing             fans and      prevent      disorder.        This      in no way a b s o l v e d      the

stewards           from u nd e rt a ki n g    their    duties      in respect        of the      safety of

s pe ct at or s and there was never a n y agreement,                           formal     or    informal,

that     the       police w o ul d accept          these     stewa rd in g     responsibiliti es.



There was           no S em i- fi na l   m at ch at H i l l s b o r o u g h    in 1982,        t herefore     the

a r r a n g e me n ts    d es c ri b ed above were         not    reass es se d    in the       light of no

s e g r e g a t i o n being      necessary.



This     policy of          policing at the L ep pi ng s Lane                   end of the ground was

in place w hen S u p e r i nt e nd e nt Lock                replaced me as sub-divisio nal

commander at F.1.                S u b - d i v i s i o n on 21st June          1982.     On the day of the

hand-over          I d i sc us se d a variety of matt er s wit h Mr Lock                         concerning

policing          policies at F.1.              I have no doubt            that    policing

a r r a n g e m e n ts   at H i l l s b o r o u g h w ou ld be discussed.               I have no

kn ow l e d g e    of p re cisely what was               said but        it did not       include a

s ug g e s t i o n of an      "agreement*           wit h the         club to    perform a stewarding

fu n c t i o n anywh er e        in the ground.



I took up the             post of Det ec ti ve S u pe r i n t e n d e n t at F D i v i s i o n and,

from that          time    on,    took no        part    in the        planning for,       or the

policing          of,    fottball       matches at H i l l s b o r o u g h until          1986 w he n   I

r et urned to S u b- di v is i on a l           duties at F. 2 sub division.



F r o m 8t h July         1982 until         12 August        1982      I was    fully    committed,

almost       to the       e xc l us i on of all         other     policing       considerations,        with

a murder          i n v e s ti g a ti on for w hi ch       I took       overall    command.        During

that     time      I would       have    neither        the time,        nor any       reason,    to make

any tour          of,    or visit       to, H i l l s b o r o u g h    football    stadium.        I have    no

r ec o l l e c t i o n of having         done so.



On    12th August          1982    I commenced a period of Annual                        leave until       5th

September          1982.



I returned to duty on 6 th S e pt em be r                       1982 and was           fully    commi tted for

the    following week             to updating myself                  on the    progress       of the

conti n u i n g murder           enquiry,       and     I began        initial    enquiries       into a

complaint        of   criminal         conduct          by a police        officer.           Again,    I w ould

have    had neither            the t i m e ; nor any          reason,       to visit H i l l s b o r o u g h

Stadi urn.



I have no        recollection,             whatsoever,           of ever having              visited S h e f f ie l d

W e d n e s d a y F.C.       w it h Mr Lock or a t te nd in g a meeting w ith him and the

S h e f f i el d W e d n e s d a y secretary,            Mr England.           My     pocket     note book

entries       up to      11th Sep te mb er           1982 are        s uf fi ci e nt l y     c om prehensive     to

enable me to say that                  no such visit             or meet in g        took     place - there        is

no    reference        to such        in my notebook.



I u nd e r s t a nd    that S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s da y       played Leeds Uni te d at

H i l l s b o r o u g h on    11th Sep te mb er          1982.       I took no         part     in planning      the

policing        o p e r a ti o n for       the    game.       On the day            itself    I was    on duty

at R o t h e r h am    inves ti ga ti ng          the a f o r e m e n t i o n e d    criminal      complaint

a ga i n s t a police          officer.           I did not a tt e nd H i l l s b o r o u g h on that

day.



I have      had the o p p o r tu n it y to read the t ranscript                            of the evi dence of

Mr Lock       to the H i l l s b o r o u g h       Inquiry,        chaired by Lord Justice Taylor.

I refute,        absolutely,           his u n de r st an di ng         of the        role of the       police     in

"s t e w a r d i n g " the Leppi ng s            Lane    end of the ground.                  In particular,        he

claims      that      he was        simply       continuing        practices          that    p ertained w he n       I

was    responsible            for    policing H il ls bo ro ug h.              This     is certainly not

true,     the    role of officers,                 whilst      under my         command,       was    one of

ensuring        s e g r e g at i on and      preventing          disorder.           There was never any

agreement        that        the    stewards       had no       role to       play at the Leppings              Lane

End.

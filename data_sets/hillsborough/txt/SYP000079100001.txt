               eventually arrived                   in S h e f f i e l d at about        11.45 to      12.00 mi d d a y and

‘went      into a nearby          pub.          The Fox       in Foxhill          R o a d.     The    pub seemed full

mostly        of L i v erpool       s u p p o r t e r s , and      there was a good atmosphere.                             1

d i d n ’t see an y f i g hting             or d r unkeness a part               from one          lad who had

perhaps        had a bit too m u c h all                he was       doing was          stood on a seat

s i n g i ng .W e    left the       pub at about 2.1 0               pm to get to the ground and                            left

the     car    on the       pub car        park.       We d i d n ’t receive a n y             police       di r e c t i o n

to the        ground but we k new the way from having                               visi t e d the       ground

before.         We a rr iv ed at the             entrance          to the ground             in L e p p i n g s Lane at

about 2.30           pm and the        sit u a t i o n then was            chaos,       I immedi a t e l y thought

we w o u l d n ’t be getting               into the         ground    in time for             the kick       off.

The     crowds were           spilling        out onto the           pavement.           We joined the             crowd

and after about               five m in u t e s       got    inside       the    large       blue    railing gates.

I later        remember        turn i n g     round and seeing              these gates             had been       closed

over.         The    crowd was       quite       tight       but    not    to the extent             that     1' got

worried.            The    crowd was moving           backwards and              forwards a lot but no one

seemed        to be getting           in        through      the turnstiles.

I saw five m ou n t e d o f f icers w i t h i n the                   crowd,        every now and again                     they

would       try to        push t hr o u g h     the    crowd to break              it    up but       it was       so

c rowded       they had a losing                battle.         I also      saw the Super i n t e n d e n t , he

was     on foot,          shouting at         people and o b v i o u s l y from wi t h i n the                   crowd

himself        it was       having     little effect.                I d i d n ’t see any other officers

in that        area,       but outside          of the       ground from the             pub w e ’d been at all

al o n g   the way there           se e m e d    to be groups             of officers          in 1 0 ’s and         1 2 ’s

see any        s t e w a r d s in that area as we w a i t e d                   in the       crowd either.              We

waited        in the       crowd and e v e n t u a l l y batt l e d             to a t u r n s t l i e , there were

then t ho ug h . O n c e    I was        t hr o u g h the tur n s t i l e    I spoke      to an     Inspector

who was stood            fay a wall       on my      left,    there were about            IS to 20

O f f i ce rs   with him spread              out along       the turnstile.           Kids    from outside

had    climbing      over       the    t u r nstile walls and getting                into    the ground

a r o u n d him,    he w a s n ’t doing anything.                   He    looked busy talking             into the

radio,      I a p p r o a c h e d him and told him who                   I was and told him that                if he

d i d n ’t do a n y t hi ng      s om e o n e was     going    to get       hurt    outside.        The

Inspector         replied       that     it was all         under     control      and that they were

sorting         it out.I    w a i te d    for my brother and mate to get                     through the

turnstiles,         only a bout a minute                  or so.      I d i d n ’t see any signs

dir e c t i n g me where         to go,        I just      saw the       tunnel    so I went       straight        for

there.          As we were       heading a cross            the y a r d to the       tunnel    my friend

told me that a g,ate had been o p e n e d .                        I. d i d n ’t even bother        to look to

see w hich gate           he was       talking       about.        We w a l k e d through the         tunnel       and

although         there were a          lot of people          in it,       it was    quite    easy to walk

down     I expected        the    terraces          to be half        empty because         of the      number        of

people      I knew were          still       outs i d e .    I got       to the end of he tunnel               and        I

was    am a z e d to see        how    packed       it was.        I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d how there

were    that many outside an d                    inside    too.     We    turned    to our    r ight at          the

end of the tunnel,               a n d w i t h i n seconds my brother               and mate       di s a p p e a r e d

from my view as            I was       pushed to the          front.        The    only way    I

can describe         it    is    like     being      on a pair       of     roller skates,        my feet

d i d n ’t touch the        floor.           It    took only seconds           for me     to get from           the

back    of the      terrace       to w it h i n five foot            of the       front   fence.        I d o n ’t

know whether         the m at ch was              going    then,    I know    it hadn't       started when                I

first     got     into the       terrace,          but once    I got        caught up     in the

terri f i c      crush    I d i d n ’t pay         any attention.

Although         I was about          five     foot from the         front    fence,      I was     still      able

to    push through         people        to get out of the way.                   I intended to get out

from    behind       the    goal       are a      I w a n te d to get as far         right as       possible.

                                                                                                             S2336

T h e n all       of a s u d de n     it came to a halt and no one was moving                              because

they were          too t ig h t l y     packed.         At that       point all         I could move was my

head.       My arms were            pinnned        to my sides.             The whole      crowd seemed to be

shouting          and scr e a m i n g    for     help.

T h e r e was a gate           in the     fencing         in front and too the               left    of me,       but

the    crowd was         so tight at            one    point       I thought      I w a s n ’t going       to get

out.      The man        in front        of me was s l u m p e d forw a r d a bit and                 I was

leaning       on him,         only because            of the       pressure      of the    crowd behind me,

my    head was        on its      side,     facing        the      right,    leaning      on his     back,    and

someone       was     leaning       on my neck so             I c o u l d n ’t get my head up or move my

head.

In the       confusion and            panick of          it all      I saw a man          to my right.        He was

a huge       man well over 6 foot, tall and well                            built,      he had    dark     short

,-hair w i t h big side           burns a nd clean shaven,                   he might      have     been thinning

on top       even.        I w o u l d say he was a g e d            in his       1age     3 0 * s , early 40* s .

He was       head and sho u l d e r s a bove             everyone         else

i                                                                                 I d o n ’t know

how    long after          that     it was       but when          I looked again,         it looked to

me as     if he had died.                His     face was          tota l l y white and there was

nothing       in his eyes.              T hey    just w e r e n ’t re g i s t e r i n g at all.            I didn't

see    him a gain after             that.

It felt as           if we were all             gra d u a l l y    going    further      towards     the    floor as

everyone          leaned on the          person        in front.           I remember      people     from behind

were    starting         to    climb on and over                  our heads      t o get to the front             fence

and    get out.          I d o n ’t know what             happened         then but there was            suddenly

bre a t h i n g    space,     and     I got my breath               back and was able            to move my

arms,     the      fella next         to me      shouted for me             to go and I climbed             onto

the    f e n c e , and out        I d o n ’t know how              I got up onto         the fence,        I can

only think           I must    have      levered myself              on s o m ething      or someone        Or­

el imbed.          I d o n ’t remember           how    I got       out    I just    remember       thinking       I

could get        out     then      I was      on the       fence.

A   p o l iceman     put his          hand out to stop me                coming       over,   and then another

b obby stood next               to him grabbed me by the                    back of the         trousers a nd

pulled me        over.          I d o n ’t know why          the first          officer       tried to stop me,

I was     by no means            the    first       out of the       terraces,          I don't    understand

how he didn't            know what was going                 on.    Whe n      I was    on the    pitch someone

put me      into     the       r e c overy    position on the grass arid I jsut                        lay there

getting my breath                back.

I got up and w a n d e r e d a r o u nd              looking       for rny brother            or my mate,       by

this    stage      the      players were            no where       to be seen and the             pitch was

l i t tered w ith        p e o p le lying       down as       I had.

I couldn't         find either              my brother       or my fri e n d so          I went    back    to the

fence      itself and           I saw a couple             of o f f i c e r s stood by a gate            pul 1 i ng

people      out.       So      I h e lp ed to       pull    three men          out.     then another       officer

came and a s k ed me              to get      out of the way so                I m oved away and he             helped

them.     I w a lk ed up to the               half way       line,       and    there was a line of

o f f i c e r e s ac r o s s    the    half way       line    for    the whole wi d i t h         of the       pitch.

I spoke       to a sergeant             and told him          I was a          policeman and my brother

was a p o li c e m a n too an d              that    I couldn't          find him he took me             to the       gym

w i t h i n the gr o u n d that             they had made          into a morgue,             for a few minutes

I looked a r ou nd there                but, I couldn't            see    him.        Then    I went    back    onto

the    pitch and e ve nt u a l l y            found my m a t e , a f t e r        looking       for my brother

more we went           back      out    t hr o u g h the     t e rracing        and along       the tunnel       and

returned out           of the g ro u n d to the              car,    where we found my b r o t h er.Its

hard    to judge         times        but    I think       I was    on the terraces             for about       15

minutes       before        I got      out.

When     I was     inside        the gorund          I didn't       see anyone          drinking a l c o h o l . A

few days        later       I found         I had a lot of bruis i n g and grazing                     to my

chest area,!

             I d o n ’t u n d er st an d why the Police        d i d n ’t intervene      the    problem whilst

             it was     still     outside    the    ground.    Once the trag e d y had h a p p e n e d        I

             think    the Police        did alright,, the      fault, was       their   o r g a n i s a t i o n before

             hand.      In my o pi n i o n they s hould have        d e l a y e d the m a t c h and got       the

             crowd sorted out           into o rd e r l y queues.       To   have delayed the m a t c h w ould

             have a l e v i a te d half     the    problem because       people w o u l d n ’t have      been so

             eagre    to get      in.

             The    day of the m a t c h     I was wearing       dark    blue    tracksuit      bottoms,      a

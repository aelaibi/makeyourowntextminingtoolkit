            I am a Fireman in the South Yorkshire County Fire Service and have

            been so for the last 13 years.

           On Saturday 15th April              1989 <150489) at 15.16 hrs               (1516)   together with
               /■” t
            D^rwalJLj One      (Callsign for one of our engines).                     I was diverted to an

            incident at the Hillsborough Football Stadium although at that time I

            didn't know the exact extent of the incident.

            Whilst travelling              along Penistone Road our Control             re directed us    to

            the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

            On our arrival at              that end a member of the South Yorkshire Police

            informed us that people inside the ground needed resuscitiation
                                                               /
            equipment urgently.  I d o n ’t know this off i / e r or his r a n k . He d i d n ’t

            tell us why the equipment was needed.

            We then took          ’Mo t iv us ’ (Oxygen Resuscitation Equipment) and First Aid
                                                                                             PAGE         2
                                                                                             S3648

                   Equipment    into X,he ground.   We entered the ground through one of the

                   concertina gates at the Leppings Lane e n d .        We immediately saw there

                   were bodies lying on the ground with their faces covered.             Initially I

                   thought that was what w e ’d been called to but the Police Officer and

                   some spectators directed us through the tunnel under the West Stand

                   and onto the terracing and then out through the gates at the front

                   onto the pit c h ­

                   i' would estimate that the time would be about 3.25           <1525) -• 3.30 pm

                   (1530).     There didn't appear to be many people left on the terracing

                   at that stage.

                   On gett i ng onto the pitch it was clear the re we re large numbers of

                   casualties with people laid out with their faces covered.

                   11 appeared to take some time to find a casualty that could be worked

                   on.

                   We then found a male     casualty who wa          ig given resuscitation by his

                   friends.    We then set up the Motivus            .m and he started to breathe

                   of his own accord.     At this point 1 /          i his friends carry him on an

                   advertising board the length of y n e      pitch to await an ambulance.
         'irfjf,
   '          His friends stayed with him and I returned to the pitch.                 I could not
COdSj V S t t
               ^es cr ^^e   ma,n    all*
                   I then stayed at the North       Stand end of the ground as that      was where

                   the casualties were by now in the main.

                   Whilst there    I attempted resuscitation on a number of people or gave

                   advice to others that were giving       it.   Some/were     revived but others
rtOUUD             -------
tf tjT             were beyond hope.Eventually a Doctor       came     round    advising whether     it

A f c b d - X ) was worth carrying        on with resuscitation/ or not.I then began         to take

 ^                 bodies into the gym behind the North S/and and putting them in
f c o b                       ---------------------
                   positions as directed by Police Of -f\ijrers .

^                  I cannot describe any of these bodies other than they were all male of

                   all ages.
                                                                            PAGE      3

The only one I cam help with on description was one we took              into the

gym and Doctor started to work o n .        The Doctor   put in a drip and the

lad partiaily revived.       The Doctor spoke to him and found out his

name was         but then he became unconscious again.            The Doctor said

he thought the lad had chest injuries.           ShortL^c after that he was

taken away.

I have been shown a copy of statement by/a                              a Sheffield

Wednesday FC Steward who states he \ a ^ e d       a body to me in the South

Stand.

I recognised a number of stewards on the day through my f oo t ba l 1

contacts although I d o n ’t know the i r n a m e s .

I cannot remember being      in the South Stand at all being handed bodies

although a number of casualt ies we r e b e n d e d o^er to us at the

Penistone Road end of the ground by Stewards/.

At some time 1 was directed by ADO ROBJOHbfe to the gymnasium which

was being used as a temporary mortuarjy pfy now to assist with the large

bui1d up of casualties.

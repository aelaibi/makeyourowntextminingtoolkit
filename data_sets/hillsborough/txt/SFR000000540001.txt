Dear Sir,

INQUIRY - DISASTER, HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM, SHEFFIELD

I enclose my submission to the Inquiry into the disaster which occurred at the
Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15th April, 1989, and apologise for its
late provision this being due to me being misinformed as to the date by which
such submissions were required.




Chief Fire Officer.
SUBMISSION OF H«E« WRIGHT, QFSM,MIFireE,FBIM, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, SOOTH
YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE, TO THE COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE
DISASTER AT THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM, SHEFFIELD, ON 15TH APRIL, 1989.




        Introduction



        I feel sure that: all the members of the Safety of                   Sports    Grounds

        Working     Party, including myself, never believed that the disaster

        at   the    Hillsborough          Stadium,   Sheffield,     could      ever        occur.

        However,     it    did,        and having given positive thought as to why it

        happened and what steps might be taken to obviate the                    possibility

        of    repetition          at      anystadium,          I   submit thefollowing

        recommendations for consideration.                In making these I am conscious

        of   the need to put forward practical suggestions capable of being

        implemented quickly and relatively easily.



2.      Recommendations



2.1     Ingress

        To prevent any unduly large crowd               from   being   kept    waiting        for

        admission    and    at the same time minimising the consequent dangers

        of crushing and illegal entry



2.1.1   Separate turnstiles should be provided to permit                    access    to    each

        stand, terrace and pen within the stadium.



2.1.2 The    turnstilesproviding                the accessmentioned          in2.1.1       above

        should be in sufficient number to               be   capable   of    admitting       the

        capacity    calculated          using   Chapter      16 of the Guide to Safety at

        Sports Grounds in not more than 1 hour, using the notional rate of

        750 persons/turnstile/hour.
Where        there      are    insufficient turnstiles to satisfy 2.1.2 above,

either:

 (i)        additional turnstiles must be provided, or



(ii)        the capacity       of        each       stand,   terrace    or   pen     should    be

            restricted        to    the       number     of spectators that the existing

            turnstiles will admit using the notional rate                         mentioned    in

            2.1.2 above.



Chapter        5   of    the       Guide       to    Safety at Sports Grounds should be

amended to satisfy the above and cross referenced to Chapter 16.



In effect the capacity of each stand, terrace and pen will be                                 the

lowest figure produced based on exit capacity, standing or seating

area and the capacity of the turnstiles.



The factor which determines the capacity should be recorded on the

General Safety Certificate for each stand, terrace and pen.



Control of Numbers



There       has    never been a legal stipulation in the Safety of Sports

Grounds Act 1975, that required the capacity of                            individual      parts

of      a     sports      ground         to     be    specified    in   a    General       Safety

Certificate.



Section 2(2) of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,                            which     did    set

out    matters       which         had    to    be included, was replaced by Section

19(2)(a) of the Fire Safety and Safety of                         Places     of    Sport     Act,

1987, with effect from 1st January, 1988.
The   present position is that the Secretary of State now has power

to    issue   Regulations     detailing     the    matters    to    be       covered,

including     capacities,    but    has    not     yet done so, therefore each

authority is free to        apply   whatever       conditions      it   wishes    to,

therefore



The   Secretary of State should urgently make Regulations regarding

the terms and conditions as may be included in the General                     Safety

Certificate.      This    should include a requirement for the capacity

of each stand, terrace and pen to be specified.



Perimeter Fences



Planned means designed to allow for the             quick    release     of    crowd

pressure need to be clearly specified in guidance to authorities.



Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

provides guidance on the width but           not    the   frequency      at    which

gates should be provided in perimeter fences.



The   provision   of     perimeter fences goes against all professional

training of Fire Service Officers and it is hoped               that     a    better

solution might be found.



Perimeter     fences   should   only      be required where it can be shown

that they are absolutely necessary and the continuing provision of

all existing fences should be reviewed in this light.
An     accepted       professional body should be requested as a matter of

urgency to produce a standard specification for a perimeter                       fence

for     use    at        sports grounds.     I recommend that this specification

provide for sections to be quickly and                  easily   removed    from    the

perimeter track side by authorised personnel in an emergency.



When     available,          this standard should be satisfied at all grounds

where perimeter fencesare considered necessary.



Where perimeter fencesare required then gates, not less than                        1.1

metre    in width, must be provided to allow spectators to be quickly

evacuated          onto    the   pitch     perimeter.    Such    gates   should      be

sufficient          in    number   to provide for the evacuation of each area

within 3 minutes, with a minimum provision for each area of 2 such

gates.     Chapter 15, paragraph 215 of the Guide to Safety at Sports

Grounds should be amended accordingly.



A level stepping arrangement should be provided through                    gates     to

avoid     tripping hazards and wherever possible such gates should be

in line with radial gangways.               Gate-release fastenings        should    be

capable       of    easy     and immediate release from the pitch side only,

especially under crowd pressure.



Stewards



It is vital that the number of stewards on duty are sufficient                       in

number, adequately trained and effective in their duties.



I    recommend that in broad terms a syllabus to enable satisfactory

training for stewards, together with                examination    standards       with

regard to their duties, be established on a national basis.
2.4.2   The    Police should be the examining authority for stewards and the

        passing of the examination will enable those so             qualified       to   be

        employed if so capable as stewards at sports grounds.



2.4.3   The    standard     of   examination should reflect the responsibilities

        and duties of each steward.



2.4.4   A Chief    Steward       should   be    appointed   to   take    charge    of    all

        stewards.



2.4.5   Senior Stewards should be appointed to take charge of the stewards

        in a defined area of the ground.



2.4.6   All stewards should be readily identifiable when undertaking their

        duties    and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

        each separately numbered to enable each steward to               be    identified

        from a distance.



2.5     Communication



2.5.1   The use of the public address system to provide advice to stewards

        and Police should be fully realised, especially when               noise     seems

        to    apparently    reduce    the      overall   effectiveness    of   hand held

        radios.   Training in the use of this equipment should be                 provided

        for   those   who    use the equipment to instigate messages and those

        who are expected to react to them.




                                            - 5-
Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium                                   for

whatever        reason, I suggest that each emergency service be alerted

even if their attendance may not be required at that                           time.          This

will      provide       a pre-warning during which basic requirements as to

the correct address to which a                 response      may     be    needed        can     be

satisfied, together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.



Should      the       situation    develop to the point of needing a response

from another or all emergency services a much                        briefer      call        will

ensure this.



I    understand        that     the     Police    have made recommendations to the

Inquiry which suggest either:-



    (i)   A senior officer of each of the                  emergency      services         be    in

          attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



(ii)      the    Police       control    box     at the stadium is provided with a

          private      wire    connection        to   the    Control       room     of        each

          emergency service.



My     opinions       regarding       these    suggestions are not supportive.                    I

understand that at Hillsborough on 15th April the                          Police        in     the

control box were not aware of the difficulties that existed on the

West Terrace.          Should this be so then I would assume that                      a      Fire

Service     Officer       would       have    equal    difficulty but even when the

problem was identified he would                  be   of    little     use     without          the

manpower        and    equipment      that     he would undoubtedly request.                    The

advantage would, therefore seem                  to   be    related       to   knowing          the

abilities of the Service.



                                        - 6-
       The provision of a senior Fire Service Officer to achieve this on,

       hopefully, the extremely infrequent                  occasions        when    it     will    be

       required      would      seem    to   be    an     over-provision         which      could be

       achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



       I also understand that the Police were in communication with their

       own    main   control       room      at Police Headquarters which already has

      private       wire    connection       to    each    of     the      emergency      services.

       Private wire connections from each of the stadiums provided with a

       safety certificate, or likely to require such in                       the       future,     to

       each    of    the    emergency        services     control rooms would also be an

       extremely expensive way of providing good information to the other

       Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.



2.6   Liaison



2.6.1 Regular liaison between all those responsible for implementing the

      requirements         of   the    Safety      of    Sports       Grounds     Act     and      the

      respective       clubs          should      take    place       to   provide      a   greater

      understanding of the problems being met.



2.6.2 The arrangements proposed by the                  Club    and     Police,     where       these

      differ    from       those   specified         in the General Safety Certificate,

      should be considered by the appropriate                    local      authority       working

      party     to     ensure      that      these      will    not     affect      other    safety

      precautions.




                                             -7-
2.7   Other Matters



2.7.1 The Club managements ofeach ground                  requiring     a    General        Safety

          Certificate       should   be    required       to    audit the safety provisions

          within their ground considering the different uses to                     which    they

          are    put.     A full written report should be presented to the local

          authority for consideration.            The full satisfaction of          the     Guide

          to Safety at Sports Grounds should be used for such audit.



          Any    proposed changes to the ground which would affect any part of

          the safety precautions should be accompanied                 by    a    safety    audit

          report       identifying   the    effects       of    the proposals and the steps

          proposed to compensate for them.             The      proposals    and   the     report

          should    be    submitted to the local authority for consideration and

          approval under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act prior to any other

          submission for approval.



2.7.2 In        order to undertake suchduties effectively it must be realised

          that manpower resources are needed and this should be catered                       for

          in     the     departments       of     local        authorities       holding     such

          responsibilities.

SUBMISSION OF CHIEF FIRE OFFICER H.E. WRIGHT# QFSM, MIFireE, FBIM, TO
COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM# SHEFFIELD DISASTER
15TH APRIL# 1989




1.    Introduction



1.1   I feel sure that all the members of the Safety of Sports                     Grounds

      Working     Party in Sheffield, Including myself never believed that

      the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium,                  Sheffield    could     ever

      occur.      However, it did and positive thought must be given as to

      why it happened and whether or not the safety precautions already

      implemented          were generally satisfactory or the facilities of the

      stadium abused to the point that they became                   inadequate.      This,

      of course, is one of the references of the Inquiry.



1.2   What     must be realised is that history has an unfortunate ability

      of repeating itself unless the lessons provided by disasters                       are

      learnt,  consolidated with those already identified from previous
                                                                ikt*
      disasters and precautions implemented that will greatly reduce^ if

      not obviate them being repeated.



1.3   The      Fire       Service    has naturally been the organisation which has
      p OS Z          t
      provided        the      necessary     expertise     to   provide   advice   on    the

      provision           of   a   reasonable standard of means of escape and fire

      safety precautions.              It also provides considerable        expertise     to
                                                                                               fp   t   ?
      deal     with       many      life   rescue      situations and the ability of the

      Service     to       apply     numbers   of      highly   trained   personnel     with

      specialist equipment quickly to any such incident should be fully




                                               1   .
      recognised, understood and used.                    As     always        time    is    extremely

      valuable and any delay in requesting such assistance can never be

      recovered and        will     only    create          a   worsening        of    a     difficult

      situation.



1.4   It     is   neither my wish nor my intention to suggest that the Fire

      Service     takes     over     the    responsibilities              of     the     Police         or

      Ambulance      Service      both of which have my highest regard, its own

      particular experiences and expertise that might be applied                                   to    a

      particular          incident     and            I   believe       that    the     incident        at

      Hillsborough, Sheffield              showed         how            the     three       emergency

      services      can    work     together          assisting         one     another      with

      particular roles that have been readily identified by society, in

      a common aim to save life.



1.5   However,      in     providing dueconsiderationof                   the events which

      occurred on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, the                             standard      of     safety

      that    had    been     applied to the stadium and what might need to be

      done to ensure that it is not repeated                        I    hope    that        I   may    be

      permitted      to     stray    beyond       the       limitations         of     Fire       Service

      responsibilities as they exist and in so doing make the following

      observations.



2.    Ground Design



2.1   It   mustbe realised that it                hasnot been possible to ensure that

      existing      grounds       will provide            conditions           that will         totally

      satisfy     the recommendations of the guidance provided in the Home

      Office booklet - Guide to Safety in                       Sports    Grounds        -       and   the

      possibility of this was accepted in its production.



                                              2   .
    2.2   The    Hillsborough         stadium    is      no exception.         For example, it is

          situated in a densely populated area of Sheffield and                           access       to

          the Leppings Lane end is restricted by the limited area available

          to    the    Club.     This     situation          cannot     be     improved      without

          considerable         expenditure      which        would,     I    feel sure, have been

^         considered unreasonable prior to this fateful incident but                              is    a

          matter      which will now require positive thought so as to overcome

          the funnelling effect of           spectators           on    that   approach      to    the

          turnstile areas.



          Consideration         of     the   method          of   achieving     this      should       be

          undertaken at the earliest opportunity by certifying                         authorities

          and club management in all cases where it exists.



    2.3   It    is    understood      that the likely^number of spectators that are

          able to pass through turnstiles by payment or ticket                         are   known.

          Although      normal       attendances        at    sports grounds would appear to

          provide little or no          difficulty           in   having     the   vast    majority

          present      in the stadium prior to the commencement of the sporting

          activity, major events which attract maximum capacity would                              seem

          to provide problems.          A regular flow of spectators to the stadium                         CAtxMt~AT(0

          has been proven to be unlikely                and       it   would   seem    natural         to

                                                                                                              a t.   Scv\Sr

          The   opportunity to bring forward the time of commencement of the

          event to 11 a.m. or 11.30 a.m. for major events in order to avoid

          drink related problems should be taken.

Where     fixtures/events             exist     which have traditionally attracted

trouble or created problems the opportunity should                            be     available

to    certifying         authorities to reduce the capacity of the stadium

either overall or in particular areas.                        This loss of revenue           may

encourage       Club     managements            to   take     a   more positive attitude

towards     the        safety,     well        being    and    overall       enjoyment         of

supporters.



The    apparent         need     to     segregate      home       and away supporters has

created many problems for the Police and Club managements but                                  it

is    evident that any action that creates a proportional inbalance

of    ingress     provision            (e.g.    turnstiles)        will     create        further

problems.         If    this inbalance cannot be overcome pre-planning to

overcome the possible problems must be effectively undertaken and

implemented as soon as it is evident that problems are likely.

the certifying authority following discussion by the                              members     of

the safety of sports grounds working party.



Whilst     being       totally         sympathetic with the predicament faced by

the Police at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough stadium I

cannot     accept       the opening of gateways in the perimeter walls of

the stadium to           allow        access    by     large      numbers    of     spectators

without     some        form     of     effective      control      being applied to the

numbers entering and their access                      to   particular       parts    of     the

ground.



The guidance document states that "walls, fences and gates should

be of appropriate height and strength and                         hand      and    foot    holds

which     might        assist climbing should be avoided".                   Access by some
spectators was obtained in this manner at the Leppings                        Lane       end

of    the     stadium    even though it was believed that a satisfactory

standard that would prevent unauthorised                 access     by       significant

numbers had been provided.             Evidence on television indicates that

some individuals are extremely athletic in                    gaining     such      access

and    the    need for further positive consideration on this subject

would seem necessary by the certifying authority                     in      conjunction

with Club management and the Police.



Perimeter Fences



The     sad   need      for such fences to prevent pitch invasion is well

known to all.        Their removal from the Wembley stadium for the Cup

Final    which followed closely after the Hillsborough disaster was

a wonderful opportunity for "fans" to display that their need was

no     long required but this was not so and proof of their need was

again readily provided.           Such fences provide          a    situation       which

goes    against      all professional training of Fire Service officers

and it is hoped that a better solution might be found.



As alternatives to the provision               of   perimeter       fences     as    they

exist at the present time I suggest



 (i)    That    an accepted professional body be requested to provide

        a specification for such fencing that should                    be     satisfied

         at all stadia where such provision is considered necessary.

        The basis of this design should be to satisfy the                      existing

        requirements        of   the    Green   Guide     and also provide for a

        vandal proof facility           that    will    enable      sections        to    be

        quickly       and    easily      removed       from   the   pitch       side     by

         authorised personnel in an emergency.
            I suggest that a minimum provision               of   two   access   points

            (minimum         width       1.1   metres) be stipulated for each penned

            area for use in an emergency, these                access   points   to    be

            suitably         positioned        at   points required by the certifying

            authority.         The existing guide provides detail relating              to

            ready opening and stewarding which should be applied.


                                                     wij
(ii)        That    all stated areas be provided which will prevent over-

            crowding and, I believe, restrict the wish                  to   invade    the

            playing area thus obviating the need for such fencing.



Whatever           is    installed         it is evident that access to the playing

area must be controlled and a need for access points,                         either    in

fences        or    walls       and      stewarded -by— Mil1 Fiilii.i'. will still be

necessary in order to remove troublemakers or gain access                         should

medical attention be needed.



The     width       of        access points         relates basically to the need for

which they areidentified.               If not part of the emergency plan for
                                                        <£j=            t"

accepted but it has been accepted generally that a width                         of    1.1

metres       will       permit       a    faster    egress of spectators than a size

below it.          Under these circumstances the              minimum    width    of 1.1

metres should now become a requirement.                     Any reduction previously

preferred in order to reduce the opportunity for                        individuals     to

gain        unauthorised         access to the playing area can be realised by

only partially               opening the gate at the access point            and use    of

Police/Stewards.

          Different           pen       designs      are        available in grounds.                 Some totally

          segregate spectators in certain areas                            whilst          others           appear          as

          radial     barriers            to       prevent sideways movement without providing
            ■tebf
          for segregation.



          In the latter it will                    always       be    difficult           to    provide           for          a

          reasonable standard of safety for spectators as one will never be

          aware of what numbers one is providing for.                                    The use of the self-

          levelling           principle by spectators being relied upon to ensure an

          "accepted" level of packing on terraces, especially in                                             the       peak

          viewing            areas,      cannot      be     sustained           after      the       Hillsborough

          tragedy.           Under these circumstances I suggest that                                penned         areas
      be     segregated areas even though controlled access points between

      them might be provided, that each be provided with its                     own    safe

      capacity which must be controlled, and each also be provided with

      its own entrances/exits and other facilities.



      Any sterile area        created       to   divide -supper-feess must       cause       a

      reduction      in the accepted capacity of the stadium by the removal

      of the capacity relevant to that sterile area.



4.3   I consider it essential that the carefully calculated                  limits         of

      safe capacity of each section of the ground be rigorously applied

      by management if the well being of spectators is to be reasonably

      assured.       In this respect sufficient stewards or Police should be

      provided to monitor and control access although I see this                       as    a

      particular responsibility of Club management.

5.    Stewards



5.1   Whereas    the    number of stewards on duty is important it is vital

      that    they     are   all      adequately      trained,      aware    of        their

      responsibilities        and     able   to    carry   them    out effectively and

      efficiently.      This is a responsibility of club management                but       I

      suggest    that they be approved as suitable only after examination

      by the Police.



5.2   Senior stewards        should    be    appointed     to    take   charge    of    the

      stewards in the particular area of the stadium for which they are

      responsible      and    these    should      also    be     approved       following

      examination      in    relation       to   their responsibilities to a higher

      standard to that of stewards by the Police.
      A Chief steward         should      be     appointed         by   club   management      and

      approved       by      the       Police           again   after   examination            his

      responsibilities.



5.4   Club management should identify the responsibilities of the Chief

      Steward,     Senior Stewards and Stewards and provide each person so

      appointed with a written document which lists these in sufficient

      detail     for   them      to     be   readily        understood.        The Club should

      arrange for the necessary training to be                       given     to   ensure    that

      such     persons      so     appointed        will    be effective and efficient In

      their duties.



5.5   All stewards must be readily identifiable when undertaking                             their

      duties and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

      so numbered to enable a steward to be identified from a distance.



5.6   Some executive powers should be vested with an individual to have

      the    final     say    on       safety   matters           leading up to and during an

      event.     This individual should implement the safety                        requirements

      stipulated       in the safety certificate, be independent of the Club

      and be able by the terms of his appointment                        to    dictate   to    the

      Club     management        and    Police          on all matters outside their legal

      control.



6.    Communication



6.1   The ready use of           the    public          address    system     provided   in   the

      stadium    to       advise    the      crowd       of a developing situation and to

      provide guidance as to the actions                    required     of    them   would    be




                                                9   .
beneficial           in     bringing    the        best    out      of   those     attending.

Generally speaking I believe that the crowd reacted well                             to     the

situation       at    Hillsborough       once       they       were      aware   of what was

happening.



The use of       the       public    address        system     to     provide      advice   to

stewards     and       Police       should    be     fully realised especially when

noise seems to apparently reduce                   the    overall        effectiveness      of

hand    held     radios. Training in the use of this equipment should

be provided for those who use the equipment to instigate messages

and those who are expected to react to them.




6.3     Should       any    decision     be       made    to     evacuate any part of a

        stadium for whatever reason I suggest that         emergency        each
                                                           yj(r
         service be alerted even if their attendance ^s^not^required

        at that time.           This will provide a pre-warning during which

        basic     requirements          as    to    the correct address to which a

        response may be needed can be satisfied together                           with     the

         need for a likely rendezvous point.



Should    the        situation develop to the point of needing a response

from another or all emergency services a much briefer                              call    will

ensure this.



I    understand       that     the    Police have made recommendations to the

Inquiry which suggest either :-



    (i) A senior officer of each of the emergency                         services    be    in

        attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



                                         10   .
(ii)     the    Police      control    box at the stadium is provided with a

         private      wire    connection    to     the   Controlroom        of     each

         emergency service.



My     opinions      regarding    these suggestions are not supportive.               I

understand that at Hillsborough on 15th April the Police                      in    the

control      box     were    not aware of the difficulties that existed on

the West Terrace.           Should this be so then I would             assume       thata

Fire     Service      Officer    would have equal difficulty but even when

the problem was identified he would be of little use without                        the

manpower       and    equipment      that he would undoubtedly request.             The

advantage would, therefore, seem to be               related     to    knowing      the

abilities of the Service.



The provision of a senior Fire Service officer to achieve this on

hopefully the extremely              infrequent    occasion     when   it will       be

required       would     seem   to    be   an   over-provision     which could be

achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



I also understand that the             Police     were   in    communication       with

their     own main control room at Police Headquarters which already

has private wire connection to each of               the      emergency     services.

Private      wire connections from each of the stadiums provided with

a safety certificate or likely to require such in the                     future     to

each    of     the    emergency       services control rooms would also be an

extremely expensive way of             providing    good      information    to     the

other Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.
Liaison



The    real    problem    seems     to     relate    to how many spectators are

likely to attend and whether the facilities are suitable for that

number.       Actual levels of attendance at the majority of sporting

occasions seem to provide few if any                major    problems         but    local

derbys,     cup   matches and quasi-international fixtures do provide

such    difficulties.        An    agreement      that     these    be    all       ticket

fixtures      would   seem   to     be     essential      and,     if   allied to the

observations made in this report, should obviate the majority                           of

problems envisaged.



The    need    for regular liaison between all members of each Safety

of Sports Grounds Working Party and the                  respective      clubs      would

seem   necessary      if a greater understanding of the problems being

met are to be realised and effectively considered so as to ensure

that    appropriate      steps     are     taken to obviate them or make them

more manageable.



The arrangements proposed by the Club                and    Police       for    a   major

sporting      occasion   referred to in 7.1 above should be considered

by the appropriate Safety of             Sports     Grounds      Working       Party    to

ensure     that   they do not affect other safety precautions already

provided.



The emergency services            should   meet     to    discuss       the    different

scenarios      that might occur at each stadium, produce special risk

plans and implement training exercises for personnel with                           regard

to their application.
Whenever    an     incident does occur it is fortunate that the Police

are already in attendance but having called the                      other     emergency

services it is essential that effective liaison is implemented on

their arrival         so   that       maximum    utilisation     of    personnel        and

resources   might          be    achieved.        If it is not satisfied valuable

time is used in        discovering         what      the   emergency    is,    what      is

expected    of   personnel            and establishing the required liaison at

the necessary levels.



LeqiBlation/Guitjalice



Although Section 10 is available as an emergency                      procedure       when

the use of such notices would seem relevant.



Each certifying authority is likely to apply the responsibilities

encompassed      by    a        safety   certificate       differently,       with     the

possibility      of    some aspects being directed incorrectly due to a

force of argument, or              not being covered at          all due             toignorance.

Central guidance on the list of                 matters which need        tobe included

in the consideration of the provision of safety within                         a     sports

stadium     should         be         provided together with      the        recommended

authority to which it              should be directed.
        8.3   Although many safety certificates                  have    now  been issued, each
                                                                               e&wofr-r\f
              authority      has    created       its    own   which      has -created a lack of

              uniformity.      Central guidance on the             certificate's          content         for

              application      on    a National basis would seem to be the better way

              of achieving a uniform standard which,                    together      with     8.2   wilt

              provide a standardisation of application and control.



        8.4   At    the    present        time    asafety certificate remains in being and

              applicable unless           Section 10(2) applies.               As    this     refers to

1“' v         action taken to obviate serious risk to spectators it^A*r-apparent

              that li                                            f to     certifying        authorities


¥                                         Under
                                                                        line with experience qgr€r

                                                    these circumstancesit             woffld      seem

                          Lc to provide a safety certificate with a limited life of,

                           :, 5 years.



        8.5   As the present        Green    Guide       is provided       with       the     status of

              guidance      only    there have been many occasions when a strength of

              argument has needed to be placed for what is in the Guide                           rather

              than the alternative.



              A    strengthening      of    this     situation        would     be to recognise the

              document as a "deemed to satisfy" document for                        the   issue      of    a

              certificate         which     would       ensure    that    the       minimum     standard

              specified      is    satisfied       unless        an      alternative         which        is

              satisfactory        to the certifying authority is provided.                     This will

              necessitate a change in the legislation.
    8.6   I suggest that^Club managements be required to "audit" the safety

          provisions      within       their      stadia     considering         the   different

          scenarios to which        they    are   put.       A     full ,, report      should   be

          presented to the certifying authority for consideration.                              .

          A + tW i     m tu jk b     I* -                .
          Any   proposed     changes to the stadium which would affect any part

          of the safety provisions should           also         include    an    audit   report

          identifying     the      effects of the proposals and the steps proposed

          to cater for them.          The   proposals        and    the    report      should   be

          submitted    to    the certifying authority prior to its presentation



•         to any other authority.

SUBMISSION OF CHIEF FIRE OFFICER H.E. WRIGHT, QFSM, MIFireE, FBIM, TO
COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM, SHEFFTKT.n DISASTER
15TH APRIL, 1989




1



1.1   I feel sure that all the members of the Safety of Sports                        Grounds

      Working       Party in Sheffield, including myself never believed that

      the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium,                  Sheffield         could    ever

      occur.        However, it did and positive thought must be given as to

      why it happened and whether or not the safety precautions already

      implemented       were generally satisfactory or the facilities of the

      stadium abused to the point that they became                  inadequate.            This,

      of course, is one of the references of the Inquiry.



1.2   What     must be realised is that history has an unfortunate ability

      of repeating itself unless the lessons provided by disasters                           are

      learnt,       consolidated with those already identified from previous

      disasters and precautions implemented that will greatly reduce if

      not obviate them being repeated.



1.3   The    Fire      Service    has naturally been the organisation which has

      provided      the necessary         expertise       to   provide   advice       on    the

      provision        of a   reasonable standard of means of escape and                    fire

      safety precautions.           It also provides considerable             expertise       to

      deal     with    many      life   rescue    situations and the ability of the

      Service     to    apply     numbers    of     highly     trained    personnel        with

      specialist equipment quickly to any such incident should be fully

      recognised, understood and used.              As     always   time      is    extremely

      valuable and any delay in requesting such assistance can never be

      recovered and       will     only    create     a    worsening     of   a     difficult

      situation.
                                            1
It     is   neither my wish nor my intention to suggest that the Fire

Service       takes    over     the    responsibilities             of    the      Police          or

Ambulance       Service       both of which have my highest regard, its own

particular experiences and expertise that might be applied                                    to    a

particular           incident     and         I    believe       that    the     incident          at

Hillsborough, Sheffield               showed       how    well     the    three       emergency

services       can    work    together         assisting         one     another      with     our

particular roles that have been readily identified by society, in

a common aim to save life.



However,       in    providing     due        consideration         of    the events which

occurred on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, the                         standard       of    safety

that    had    been     applied to the stadium and what might need to be

done to ensure that it is not repeated                      I     hope    that     I    may        be

permitted      to     stray     beyond       the     limitations         of    Fire     Service

responsibilities as they exist and in so doing make the following

observations.



Ground Design



It    must be realised that it has not been possible to ensure that

existing      grounds     will    provide           conditions         that    will     totally

satisfy     the recommendations of the guidance provided in the Home

Office booklet - Guide to Safety in                      Sports    Grounds       -      and    the

possibility of this was accepted in its production.



The    Hillsborough       stadium        is       no exception.         For example, it is

situated in a densely populated area of Sheffield and                              access          to




                                        2.
           the Leppings Lane end is restricted by the limited area available

           to    the    Club.          This        situation             cannot         be      improved      without

           considerable            expenditure              which        would,         I    feel sure, have been

           considered unreasonable prior to this fateful incident but                                              is    a

           matter      which will now require positive thought so as to overcome

           the funnelling effect of                         spectators         on       that     approach     to    the

           turnstile areas*



   2.3     It    is    understood          that the likely number of spectators that are

           able to pass through turnstiles by payment or ticket                                         are    known.

           Although         normal      attendances                 at      sports grounds would appear to

           provide little or no                  difficulty              in    having          the   vast   majority

           present      in the stadium prior to the commencement of the sporting

           activity, major events which attract maximum capacity would                                             seem

           to provide problems.                 A regular flow of spectators to the stadium

           has been proven to be unlikely                           and       it    would       seem   natural          to

           expect that the 30 minutes prior to the start will be exceedingly

           busy unless attendance at an earlier time can be made                                          attractive

           to the majority, possibly by some form of entertainment.

   2.4     The   apparent          need     to        segregate             home    and away supporters has

           created many problems for the Police and Club managements but                                                it

           is    evident that any action that creates a proportional inbalance

           of    ingress       provision             (eg       turnstiles)              will     create       further

           problems.          If      this inbalance cannot be overcome pre-planning to

           overcome the possible problems must be effectively undertaken and

           implemented as soon as it is evident that problems are likely.

   2.5     Whilst      being       totally          sympathetic with the predicament faced by

           the Police at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough stadium I



                                                             3.
      cannot        accept    the opening of gateways in the perimeter walls of

      the stadium to          allow      access   by   large    numbers    of     spectators

      without        some    form   of    effective     control      being applied to the

      numbers entering and their access                to    particular    parts       of    the

      ground.



2.6   The guidance document states that "walls,                 fences and gates should

      be of appropriate height and strength and                  hand     and foot          holds

      which     might       assist climbing should be avoided".            Access by some

      spectators was obtained in this manner at the Leppings                      Lane       end

      of    the      stadium    even though it was believed that a satisfactory

      standard that would prevent unauthorised                  access    by significant

      numbers had been provided.             Evidence on television indicates that

      some individuals are extremely athletic in                    gaining     such    access

      and     the    need for further positive consideration on this subject

      would seem necessary,                                 __K (         4)



3.    Perimeter Fences



3.1   The sad need for such fences to prevent pitch                   invasion     is       well

      known to all.          Their removal from theWembley stadium for the Cup

      Final which followed closely after the Hillsborough disaster was

      a wonderful opportunity for "fans" to display that their need was

      no long required but this was not so and proof of their need                           was

      again     readily      provided.       Such fences provide a situation which

      goes against all professional training of Fire                    Service    officers

      and it is hoped that a better solution might be found.



3.2   As    alternatives       to the       provision       of perimeter fences asthey

      exist at the present time I suggest



                                             4.
 (i)     All seated areas which will prevent          over-crowding       and,    I

         believe, restrict the wish to invade the playing area.



                                          tting which is hydraulically or

         electrically ppierated so that whole sections pari be             opened

         under   the    control   of Police.     It is believed that such a




Whatever is installed it is evident that access               to   the    playing     ^

area must be controlled and a need for access gatesf c9D&rp££fed by

the Police(in order to remove troublemakers or gain access should

medical attention be needed,will still be necessary.



Control of spectators inside the stadium



The    penning   of     spectators   in   certain     areas   of    the stadium

especially behind each goal is now accepted practice at                  most    if

not all stadiums especially where standing facilities exist-



Each   penned    area     is   provided   with   an    accepted capacity for

spectators based on the controlling features             identified       in    the

guidance    booklet previously referred to.           This is not a mythical

figure but it is one that has been carefully calculated and needs

to be applied by management if the well-being of spectators is to

be reasonably assured.         In this respect    sufficient       stewards      or

Police     should be provided to monitor and control access although

I see this as a particular responsibility of club management.
Stewards



Whereas the number of stewards on duty is important it                            is    vital

that      they       are alladequately             trained,     aware      of    their

responsibilities and able            to       carry    them    out    effectively          and

efficiently.        This      is a responsibility of club management but I

suggest that they be approved as suitable only after                            examination

by the Police.



Senior        stewards    should    be    appointed       to    take       charge       of the

stewards in the particular area of the stadium for which they are

responsible          and these            should      also be    approved         following

examination in relation to their                   responsibilities        to     a     higher

standard to that of stewards by the Police.



A     Chief     steward   should         be    appointed by      club management and

approved       by    the Police          again        after examination            of     his

responsibilities.



Club management should identify the responsibilities of the Chief

Steward, Senior Stewards and Stewards and provide each person                              so

appointed with a written document which lists these in sufficient

detail for them          to   be   readily       understood.         The    Club       should

arrange       for    the necessary        training to be given to ensure that

such persons so appointed will                be    effective     and      efficient       in

their duties.



All    stewards must be readily identifiable when undertaking their

duties and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

so numbered to enable a steward to be identified from a distance.
6.    Communication



6.1   The    ready   use      of     the      public       address    system provided in the

      stadium to advise the crowd of                   a    developing       situation      and    to

      provide      guidance        as    to     the    actions required of them would be

      beneficial        in    bringing        the     best    out    of     those        attending.

      Generally      speaking           I believe that the crowd reacted well to the

      situation at Hillsborough                 once    they      were     aware    of   what     was

      happening.



6.2   The    use   of    the    public         address       system to advise stewards and

      Police would also seem to be fully realised especially when noise

      seems to reduce the overall effectiveness of hand held radios.



6.3   Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium for

      whatever reason I suggest that each emergency service be                              alerted

      even if their attendance is not required at that time.                              This will

      provide a pre-warning during which basic requirements as                              to    the

      correct      address      to      which    a     response      may    be     needed    can be

      satisfied together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.



6.4   Should the situation develop to the point of needing                           a    response

      from    another        or all emergency services a much briefer call will

      ensure this.



6.5   I understand that the Police have                    made     recommendations         to    the

      Inquiry which suggest either :-



       (i)    A    senior      officer        of each of the emergency services be in

              attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



                                                7.
(ii)     the Police control box at the stadium is                provided      with      a

         private     wire    connection        to    the   Control    room     of     each

         emergency service.



My opinions regarding these suggestions cure not                     supportive.         I

understand       that     at Hillsborough on 15th April the Police in the

control box were not aware of the difficulties                   that      existed      on

the    West    Terrace.      Should this be so then I would assume that a

Fire Service Officer would have equal difficulty                     but    even      when

the    problem was identified he would be of little use without the

manpower and equipment that he would                 undoubtedly      request.         The

advantage      would,     therefore,       seem     to be related to knowing the

abilities of the Service.



The provision of a senior Fire Service officer to achieve this on

hopefully      the   extremely          infrequent    occasion    when      it will be

required would seem          to    be    an    over-provision     which      could     be

achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



I     also   understand      that   the       Police were in communication with

their own main control room at Police Headquarters which                       already

has    private     wire     connection to each of the emergency services.

Private wire connections from each of the stadiums provided                         with

a     safety   certificate or likely to require such in the future to

each of the emergency services control rooms                  would     also     be    an

extremely      expensive     way    of     providing       good information to the

other Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.
    7.    Liaison



    7.1   The real problem seems to             relate      to    how    many     spectators        are

          likely to attend and whether the facilities are suitable for that

          number.     Actual levels of attendance at the majority of                           sporting

          occasions      seem    to   provide         few if any major problems but local

          derbys, cup matches and quasi-international fixtures                           do    provide

          such    difficulties.            An    agreement        that     these be     all     ticket

          fixtures would seem         to    be    essential         and,    if    allied       to    the

          observations       made in this report, should obviate the majority of



•
          problems envisaged.



    7.2   The need for regular liaison between all members of                           each    Safety

          of    Sports   Grounds      Working Party and the respective clubs would

          seem necessary if a greater understanding of the                        problems       being

          met are to be realised and effectively considered so as to ensure

          that appropriate steps are taken to obviate                      them    or    make       them

          more manageable.



    7.3   The    arrangements     proposed       by        the    Club and Police for a major

^         sporting occasion referred to in 7.1                   above should      be    considered

          by    the   appropriate      Safety         of    Sports Grounds Working Party to

          ensure that they do not affect other safety                      precautions         already

          provided.



    7.4   The    emergency      services    should         meet    to    discuss the different

          scenarios that might occur at each stadium, produce special                               risk

          plans     and implement training exercises for personnel with regard

          to their application.




                                                 9.
7.5      Whenever an incident does occur it is fortunate that              the   Police

         cure already        in attendance but having called the other emergency

         services it is essential that effective liaison is implemented on

         their   arrival      so   that   maximum   utilisation     of   personnel and

         resources might be achieved.         If it     is   not   satisfied   valuable

         time    is   used    in   discovering   what    the   emergency is, what is

         expected of personnel and establishing the            required    liaison   at

         the necessary levels.

22nd June, 1989
SUBMISSION OF CHIEF FIRE OFFICER H.B. WRIGHT, QFSM, MIFireE, FBIM, TO
COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM, SHEFFIELD DISASTER
15TH APRIL, 1989




1.    Introduction



1.1   I feel sure that all the members of the Safety of Sports                      Grounds

      Working       Party in Sheffield, including myself never believed that

      the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium,                Sheffield         could    ever

      occur.      However, it did and positive thought must be given as to

      why it happened and whether or not the safety precautions already

      implemented       were generally satisfactory or the facilities of the

      stadium abused to the point that they became                inadequate.            This,

      of course, is one of the references of the Inquiry.



1.2   What     must be realised is that history has an unfortunate ability

      of repeating itself unless the lessons provided by disasters                         cure

      learnt,     consolidated with those already identified from previous

      disasters and precautions implemented that will greatly reduce if

      not obviate them being repeated.



1.3   The    Fire      Service    has naturally been the organisation which has

      provided      the    necessary      expertise     to   provide    advice      on     the

      provision       of   a   reasonable standard of means of escape and fire

      safety precautions.           It also provides considerable           expertise       to

      deal     with    many      life   rescue    situations and the ability of the

      Service     to    apply     numbers    of    highly    trained    personnel        with

      specialist equipment quickly to any such incident should be fully

      recognised, understood and used.             As   always   time       is    extremely

      valuable and any delay in requesting such assistance can never be

      recovered and        will    only   create    a   worsening      of   a     difficult

      situation.
                                            1.
1.4   It     is   neither my wish nor my intention to suggest that the Fire

      Service     takes     over     the    responsibilities               of    the    Police             or

      Ambulance      Service       both of which have my highest regard, its own

      particular experiences and expertise that might be applied                                      to    a

      particular          incident     and        I     believe       that      the     incident           at

      Hillsborough, Sheffield              showed       how    well     the      three          emergency

      services      can    work    together        assisting         one      another       with       our

      particular roles that have been readily identified by society, in

      a common aim to save life.



1.5   However,      in    providing     due       consideration          of      the events which

      occurred on Saturday, 15th April, 1989, the                        standard        of       safety

      that    had   been     applied to the stadium and what might need to be

      done to ensure that it is not repeated                     I     hope      that       I    may       be

      permitted     to     stray     beyond       the     limitations           of    Fire       Service

      responsibilities as they exist and in so doing make the following

      observations.



2.    Ground Design



2.1   It    must be realised that it hasnot been possible                            to ensure that

      existing      grounds will       provide            conditions that will                   totally

      satisfy     the recommendations of the guidance provided in the Home

      Office booklet - Guide to Safety in                     Sports    Grounds         -       and    the

      possibility of this was accepted in its production.



2.2   The    Hillsborough      stadium       is       no exception.             For example, it is

      situated in a densely populated area of Sheffield and                              access            to




                                             2.
the Leppings Lane end is restricted by the limited area available

to    the    Club.      This     situation     cannot      be      improved      without

considerable         expenditure    which      would,      I    feel sure, have been

considered unreasonable prior to this fateful incident but                            is    a

matter      which will now require positive thought so as to overcome

the funnelling effect of           spectators        on    that     approach     to    the

turnstile areas.



It    is    understood      that the likely number of spectators that are

able to pass through turnstiles by payment or ticket                       are    known.

Although      normal    attendances       at     sports grounds would appear to

provide little or no           difficulty      in    having       the   vast   majority

present      in the stadium prior to the commencement of the sporting

activity, major events which attract maximum capacity would                           seem

to provide problems.           A regular flow of spectators to the stadium

has been proven to be unlikely             and      it    would    seem   natural          to

expect that the 30 minutes prior to the start will be exceedingly

busy unless attendance at an earlier time can be made                      attractive

to the majority, possibly by some form of entertainment.



The    apparent      need   to    segregate      home      and away supporters has

created many problems for the Police and Club managements but                              it

is    evident that any action that creates a proportional inbalance

of    ingress   provision         (eg   turnstiles)        will     create       further

problems.       If    this inbalance cannot be overcome pre-planning to

overcome the possible problems must be effectively undertaken and

implemented as soon as it is evident that problems are likely.



Whilst      being    totally     sympathetic with the predicament faced by

the Police at the Leppings Lane end of the Hillsborough stadium I
      cannot      accept         the opening of gateways in the perimeter walls of

      the stadium to             allow       access   by   large   numbers      of    spectators

      without      some      form       of     effective    control    being applied to the

      numbers entering and their access                    to   particular     parts     of     the

      ground.



2.6   The guidance document states that "walls,                    fences and gates should

      be of appropriate height and strength and                    hand      and foot         holds

      which     might      assist climbing should be avoided". Access by some

      spectators was obtained in this manner at the Leppings                           Lane     end

      of    the    stadium         even though it was believed that a satisfactory

      standard that would prevent unauthorised                     access     by significant

      numbers had been provided.                 Evidence on television indicates that

      some individuals are extremely athletic in                      gaining    such        access

      and   the    need for further positive consideration on this subject

      would seem necessary.



3.    Perimeter Fences



3.1   The sad need for jsuch fences £to prevent pitch                     invasion      is    well
                          '"’T     C     c     ■4 &C
      known to all.         (Their removal^ from the Wembley stadium for the Cup

      Final which followed closely after the Hillsborough disaster                             was

      a wonderful opportunity for "fans" to display that their need was

      no long required but this                  was not, so^ and proof of           their needwas

      again     readily          provided.Such fences provide a              situation which

      goes against all professional training of Fire                        Service     officers

      and it is hoped that a better solution might be found.



      As    alternatives           to    the      provision     of perimeter fences asthey

      exist at the present time I suggest



                                                 4.
 (i)     All seated areas which will prevent             over-crowding       and,    I

         believe, restrict the wish to invade the playing area.



(ii)     A    new   type     of   fencing/gating    which is hydraulically or

         electrically operated so that whole sections can be                  opened

         under      the   control    of Police.     It is believed that such a

         provision has been installed in France.



Whatever is installed it is evident that access                  to   the    playing

area must be controlled and a need for access gates controlled by

the Police in order to remove troublemakers or gain access should

medical attention be needed will still be necessary.



Control of spectators inside the stadium



The    penning      of     spectators   in   certain     areas   of    the stadium

especially behind each goal is now accepted practice at                     most    if

not all stadiums especially where standing facilities exist.



Each   penned       area     is   provided   with   an    accepted capacity for

spectators based on the controlling features                identified       in    the

guidance      booklet previously referred to.            This is not a mythical

figure but it is one that has been carefully calculated and needs

to be applied by management if the well-being of spectators is to

be reasonably assured.            In this respect    sufficient       stewards      or

Police       should be provided to monitor and control access although

I see this as a particular responsibility of club management.
5.    Stewards



5.1   Whereas the number of stewards on duty is important it                                is     vital

      that      they      are       all     adequately          trained,          aware     of     their

      responsibilities and able              to        carry   them        out    effectively         and

      efficiently.         This      is a responsibility of club management but I

      suggest that they be approved as suitable only after                               examination

      by the Police.



5.2   Senior    stewards        should      be    appointed          to    take    charge        of the

      stewards in the particular area of the stadium for which they are

      responsible         and       these        should       also    be     approved       following

      examination in relation to their                      responsibilities           to   a      higher

      standard to that of stewards by the Police.



5.3   A     Chief   steward      should      be       appointed       by    club management and

      approved       by   the      Police    again           after        examination         of     his

      responsibilities.



5.4   Club management should identify the responsibilities of the Chief

      Steward, Senior Stewards and Stewards and provide each person                                   so

      appointed with a written document which lists these in sufficient

      detail for them         to    be    readily        understood.             The   Club      should

      arrange       for   the      necessary          training to be given to ensure that

      such persons so appointed will                   be    effective       and       efficient      in

      their duties.



5.5   All     stewards must be readily identifiable when undertaking their

      duties and I suggest that this be in the form of coloured jerkins

      so numbered to enable a steward to be identified from a distance.



                                                 6.
6.    Communication



6.1   The    ready       use    of    the       public       address       system provided in the

      stadium to advise the crowd of                     a     developing      situation      and    to

      provide      guidance          as    to     the    actions required of them would be

      beneficial         in    bringing         the     best    out    of     those        attending.

      Generally      speaking             I believe that the crowd reacted well to the

      situation at Hillsborough                  once     they      were     aware    of   what     was

      happening.



6.2   The    use    of    the     public          address       system to advise stewards and

      Police would also seem to be fully realised especially when noise

      seems to reduce the overall effectiveness of hand held radios.



6.3   Should any decision be made to evacuate any part of a stadium for

      whatever reason I suggest that each emergency service be                                alerted

      even if their attendance is not required at that time.                               This will

      provide a pre-warning during which basic requirements as                                to    the

      correct      address       to       which    a    response       may    be     needed    can be

      satisfied together with the need for a likely rendezvous point.



6.4   Should the situation develop to the point of needing                             a    response

      from   another          or all emergency services a much briefer call will

      ensure this.



      I understand that the Police have                      made     recommendations         to    the

      Inquiry which suggest either :-



       (i)   A     senior      officer          of each of the emergency services be in

             attendance at the Police control box at a stadium, or



                                                  7.
(ii)     the Police control box at the stadium is                 provided      with     a

         private     wire    connection        to   the   Control    room       of    each

         emergency service.



My opinions regarding these suggestions are                 not     supportive.         I

understand      that      at Hillsborough on 15th April the Police in the

control box were not aware of the difficulties                  that      existed      on

the     West   Terrace.      Should this be so then I would assume that a

Fire Service Officer would have equal difficulty                    but    even      when

the     problem was identified he would be of little use without the

manpower and equipment that he would                undoubtedly      request.         The

advantage      would,     therefore,       seem     to be related to knowing the

abilities of the Service.



The provision of a senior Fire Serviceofficer to achieve this on

hopefully      the   extremely          infrequent occasion       when     it will be

required would seem          to    be    an    over-provision     which     could      be

achieved more easily by close liaison between the Services.



I     also   understand      that   the       Police were in communication with

their own main control room at Police Headquarters which                        already

has    private     wire     connection to each of the emergency services.

Private wire connections from each of the stadiums provided                          with

a     safety   certificate or likely to require such in the future to

each of the emergency services controlrooms                  would       also    be    an

extremely      expensive     way    of        providing   good information to the

other Services which good training and liaison should satisfy.
Liaison



The real problem seems to             relate    to     how many       spectators         are

likely to attend and whether the facilities are suitable for that

number.     Actual levels of attendance at the majority of                         sporting

occasions      seem    to   provide     few if any major problems but local

derbys, cup matches and quasi-international fixtures                         do    provide

such     difficulties.      An    agreement        that     these      be    all    ticket

fixtures would seem         to   be    essential        and,     if    allied      to    the

observations     made in this report, should obviate the majority of

problems envisaged.



The need for regular liaison between all members of                         each    Safety

of    Sports   Grounds      Working Party and the respective clubs would

seem necessary if a greater understanding of the                       problems      being

met are to be realised and effectively consideredso as to ensure

that appropriate steps are taken to obviate                     them    or    make them

more manageable.



The     arrangements     proposed      by    the      Club and Police for a major

sporting occasion referred to in 7.1 above should                      be    considered

by    the   appropriate      Safety     of     Sports Grounds Working Party to

ensure that they do not affect other safety                    precautions         already

provided.



The     emergency     services   should        meet    to      discuss the different

scenarios that might occur at each stadium, produce special                             risk

plans     and implement training exercises for personnel with regard

to their application.
7.5      Whenever an incident does occur it is fortunate that               the   Police

         are     already      in attendance but having called the other emergency

         services it is essential that effective liaison is implemented on

         their    arrival      so   that   maximum   utilisation     of   personnel and

         resources might be achieved.          If it     is   not   satisfied   valuable

         time     is   used    in   discovering   what    the   emergency is, what is

         expected of personnel and establishing the             required    liaison   at

         the necessary levels.

Dear Mr Webster




IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FINAL REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH
STADIUM DISASTER


Thank you for your letter of 22 February about the Final
Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry. I am sorry I have not
replied sooner.

The recommendations in the Final Report.on all seated
accommodation are not confined to football grounds (paragraphs
86-89 of the Final Report refer). The provisions of the
Football Spectators Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to require the
introduction of all seated accommodation cannot, however, be
extended to grounds used for sports other than association
football. Further primary legislation would be necessary to
achieve this and we shall first discuss this issue with the
relevant representative sporting organisations.

We have noted the position of Owlerton Stadium. Paragraphs 86
and 237 of the Final report in relation to the use of
greyhound stadia would appear relevant here.

The intention is to bring in the commencement of the relevant
sections of Part I of the 1989 Act and set up the Football
Licensing Authority as quickly as possible.  In the meantime
we take the view that football clubs should, in anticipation
of statutory direction, make plans for and, wherever possible,
introduce all seated accommodation at grounds.

The Report's recommendations on the provision of exits in
perimeter fencing stems from paragraph 22 of Appendix 3 of the
Report. All pitch perimeter fences should contain exit gates
to the pitch. Where their installation poses difficulty of
the sort your describe the solution is a matter for local
    C fo.

        safety and the measures needed to secure the orderly conduct

                             FINAL OBSERVATIONS




I. INTRODUCTION
1.      A large number of witnesses and a great deal of evidence has
been heard in the course of the 31 days daring which the inquiry has
been sitting.     We do not propose in these observations to go into
detail or seek to resolve issues of minor importance.      We will give
our views on the major issues and seek to indicate what in our opinion
are the important findings of fact which the Tribunal ought to make.
We do not conceive it to be our task to invite the      Tribunal to
apportion blame, but we recognise that is inevitable that criticisms
will be made in the course of deciding what happened and why.         We
shall not shrink from making such criticisms as we consider
appropriate.


2.      In deciding what happened, we have been greatly assisted by
the video and photographic records, all of which have been freely made
available by their owners.     We should like also to place on record our
gratitude to the interested parties for their co-operation in
producing relevant documents and witnesses and to the West Midlands
Police for their immense effort in interviewing witnesses and
collecting the necessary evidence and in producing for us, often at
very short notice, exceedingly helpful reports and summaries of their
enquiries.     Without that assistance and co-operation our task would
have been impossible.     As it is, we are conscious that we have
completed this stage of the inquiry within 3 months of the occurrence
of the disaster and that many witnesses who were at the ground and who
could have given relevant evidence have not been called.     We have
taken the greatest possible care to try to call a representative cross
section of witnesses and to ensure that no serious issue has been left
uninvestigated or uncovered by evidence.     We are satisfied that we
have succeeded in this objective and that sufficient evidence has been
called before the Tribunal to enable it to reach proper and accurate
findings.     All parties represented have had the opportunity to
nominate witnesses whom they considered were able to give useful
evidence and we have, so far as possible, tried to accommodate them.
We confidently believe that there are and can be no complaints that
any relevant witness, who could add to the account given by others,
has been overlooked or that any evidence has been omitted which
affects any material finding of fact.


3.      In opening this inquiry on 15th May, there were set out what
the indications were at that stage of the sequence of events.       After
31 days of evidence, it is not necessary to change anything of
importance.    The picture, broadly speaking, remains the same.     By
about 2.30 pm, there was a serious crush outside the turnstiles at
Leppings Lane.    As the minutes went by, the situation deteriorated and
by 2.47 had reached such a state that the experienced police officer
in charge, Superintendent Marshall, decided that the only way to avoid
injuries or death was to open the exit gates to relieve pressure.        He
radioed a message to the controller, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield,
who authorised the opening of the gates.    At 2.52 pm Gate C was opened
and about 2000 went through it.    By this time, the two central pens on
the terraces, 3 and 4, were full, although there was space on the
wings.    When the gate was opened, no measures were taken to prevent
those entering going down the tunnel ahead of them into the already
crowded central pens.     Most did so, causing severe congestion in the
pens.    As a result, 95 in the pens were crushed to such an extent that
they died and many more were injured.     Unfortunately, the police
officers in the control room and on the perimeter of the pitch failed
to appreciate that the pens were overcrowded and that fans were in
distress.   The perimeter gates, inadequate as they were, were not
opened in time and measures to relieve the situation were
insufficiently expeditious or adequate.    This does not mean that
individual police officers did not do all they could.     The fault lay
in a lack of planning and of leadership and, above all, in a failure
to appreciate the need to control the numbers in the central pens.


II. STATE OF THE GROUND
1.        Following representations by the South Yorkshire County
Council in April 1978, on 7th August 1978 Hillsborough was designated
as a stadium requiring a safety certificate under the Safety of sports
Grounds Act 1975 with effect from 1st January 1979.     The club
appointed Dr. E as twood’s firm, Eastwood and Partners, Consulting
Engineers, to act on its behalf in its dealings with SYCC and/or
Sheffield Metropolitan District Council "in relation to the ground
being designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act" (Doc: 30).
There were meetings and correspondence about various improvements
which were needed to the ground in order to achieve the capacity
desired by the Club.    The Leppings Lane terraces were awarded a
capacity of 10,100, after the existing crush barriers had been tested
and, as necessary, replaced and new ones positioned.    This capacity
was based on the figure in the Green Guide, stated to be the maximum,
of 5.4 per m2 reduced by about 10% to take account of the lack of
gangways.   This lack was not considered by Dr. Eastwood to be of
significance because of the ease of movement throughout the terrace:
at that time, there were no radial fences.


2.      In 1981 at a cup semi-final there was some crushing. This         was
caused by a combination of uneven distribution on the terrace, an over
capacity of about 500 and the late arrival, due to traffic problems,
of a number of supporters.     An early goal exacerbated the situation,
because there was a surge, and a number of fans were injured.
Perimeter gates were eventually opened and fortunately sufficient fans
were able to escape to alleviate the problem.     There had been some
crushing at the turnstiles and the police were, according to Mr Vaux,
slow to react to events.     There are obvious similarities to the events
of 15th April 1989, but fortunately the injuries were few.


3.      It is significant that the police at the time    appear to have
believed that the figure of 10,1000 in the Safety Certificate was too
high: see Doc: 136.   Their letter to the FA does not reflect this
belief - see Doc: 138 - and it does not seem to have been put to the
Working Party of SYCC concerned with the Safety Certificate.      The
answer to the problem was considered to be the division of the terrace
by radial fences with 3 pens of roughly equal areas.     Eastwood and
Partners were asked by the Club at the same time to consider an
alteration to the turnstiles, but that did not in the end come to
anything.
4.        The erection of the pens was not of itself a bad idea.      The
fences were to have gates at the top, to enable egress to be made to
the adjoining pens.    Much has been asked about these gates and the
arrangements, if any, to man them, whe ther by stewards or by the
police.    It seems they were to have a dual use: first, to enable fans
to go from one pen to another to help in an even distribution on the
terrace as a whole and secondly, as emergency exits in case of the
need to evacuate the pen.    Dr. Eastwood said that he believed there
would be police control over these gates because he recognised the
importance of maintaining the numbers of people in the pens.
Unfortunately, although he was aware of the importance of this
control, he does not seem to have impressed the club or the working
party with it.    The police interpreted control as meaning that the
gates should be left open, only needing an attendant if they were to
be closed and might need to be opened in an emergency.


5.        The reality was, as Dr. Eastwood accepted, that without any
mechanical means of counting, there was no possibility of adhering to
the capacity in the pens.      Accordingly, no capacity was formally
adopted and the safety certificate remained as it was.     Reliance was
placed on visual assessment.     The problem with that was that all
responsible, both police and stewards, accepted and tolerated density
in excess of that which was proper.     Evidence was given by police
officers to the effect that full meant chest to back and shoulder to
shoulder and that it was only when people were in obvious discomfort
that action would be taken to shut off a pen.     This is not
intentionally callous; it is a reflection of what football crowds have
been conditioned to put up with.     It is significant that in both 1987
and 1988 the conditions on the terrace in the central pens were
thoroughly unpleasant, but no-one complained and each match received a
clean bill of health.   The failure to seek the views of supporters or
to take any steps to inquire into their comfort is a notable feature
of the story unfolded in the evidence.   It has led to assumptions
being made which were dangerously inaccurate.


6.      In 1985 there were plans to improve the turnstiles at Leppings
Lane.   In addition, the police asked for more radial fences.    The main
purpose of those changes was segregation, so that home and away
supporters could both be accommodated at the west end of the ground.
In the result, the scheme to increase the turnstile numbers, and to
achieve not only segregation but a means of counting numbers into each
part of the terrace, was not pursued due to the reluctance of the club
to incur the expense.   In fairness to the club, it does not appear
that Dr. Eastwood impressed upon them with sufficient emphasis the
absolute need to keep the numbers in the pens to a safe level and the
desirability of the increase of turnstiles to achieve that.     He said
that he saw it as his duty to advise the club on the safety
implication of any proposal and to raise any objections he may have
had on that score.   But he seems, perhaps understandably, to have
adopted the attitude that the working party was there to approve or to
disapprove and, if it was satisfied, all well and good.   The working
party for its part did not appreciate the absolute need for regulation
of the numbers in the pens and so no steps were taken to review the
safety certificate appropriately.   In the result, the centre pen was
divided by a radial fence down its centre and part of it was taken out
of commission by a second fence to form the sterile area now known as
pen 5.   The barriers in pen 3 had to be modified because one stretched
right across it.     This was done by removing two sections of railing.
This had an effect on capacity and also resulted in the gaps being too
wide.    In 1986, as a result of a police request, barrier 144 in pen 3
was removed because it was said to be causing an obstruction at the
mouth of the tunnel.     This, too, had an effect on capacity.


7.          It is clear from the history that the pens were developed in a
piecemeal fashion.     It is difficult to accept Dr. E as twood’s evidence
that he made a positive decision not to follow the Green Guide advice
on the width of gaps and that there was a full discussion at the
working party.     There is no record of such a discussion, which is
surprising.     One suspects that the significance of the changes and the
need to ensure that there ^/as no overcrowding was not fully
appreciated at the time and there is an element of hindsight creeping
into the evidence that has been given.     Furthermore, the record of the
telephone calls at docs. 379 and 380 do not suggest that Dr. Eastwood
was as concerned as he now suggests about the need to monitor and
control numbers in the pens.     His evidence that he was misquoted by
his colleague Mr Strange is not very convincing.      Be that as it may,
the result of the changes was that the capacities of the pens
according to the formulae set out in the Green Guide were 822 in 3 and
871 in 4.     A conservative estimate of the numbers in pen 3 at 1503 pm
on 15th April 1989 is 1576.     It is likely that that pen contained at
least double its safe numbers.
8.        In April 1986 the Sheffield City Council became the licensing
authority.   Mr Bownes was the individual responsible.     He himself had
no direct knowledge of spo r t s ’ grounds and their safety and was
responsible for a large number of disparate licensing systems.           In May
1986 he reported that the conditions attached to the safety
certificate gave "some cause for concern, as they appear to be
inadequate or inappropriate in some areas".      In evidence, he said that
those were ill-chosen words and he meant nothing more than that the
certificate should be updated to reflect the substitution of the City
for the County Council.     We find that evidence unsatisfactory,        but we
are left in the dark      as to the precise ways in which Mr Bownes
believed the conditions were inadequate or inappropriate.      They
clearly were in that they failed to reflect the existence of the pens.
Mr Bownes very properly embarked upon a review of the conditions and
decided that the working party system inherited from the County
Council needed to be changed.     Sadly, his review was not concluded,
nor indeed nearly concluded by 15th April 1989.      He was undoubtedly
overburdened and he did not appreciate that there was any real problem
at Hillsborough.   Nevertheless, there can be no excuse for the failure
to sort the certificate out and more particularly to ensure that
something was done to prevent overcrowding on the terraces.         In
fairness to him, the other members of the advisory committee (as the
working party became) did not apparently appreciate the need for
action.   The absence   of any certificate at all at Sheffield United and
the glaring omission      to change the capacity for the Kop are
symptomatic of failure to do what ought to have been done.
9.      The police and fire authority both had an input, being
statutory consul tees.    But on the key issue of capacity neither had a
direct concern.     The police were, of course, concerned with problems
of order and generally safety.     They were not experts in capacity nor
is it altogether surprising that they thought in terms of visual
monitoring.   The fire service was concerned with the sufficiency of
emergency evacuation measures.     They say they were given to understand
at a meeting on 10th April 1985 that the police would man the gates at
the back of the radial fences and thereby be able to monitor numbers.
The police deny this.     It is difficult to believe that there was such
a positive undertaking by the police: if there had been, one would
expect it to be recorded in writing and it is not.     The only record is
back in 1981 (Doc: 153) where it is noted that the new gates would be
under police control. .The., probab.il ity is that the need to control
numbers was not properly appreciated so that having men at the gates
was not considered to be as important as it now appears.      The fire
service may well have believed that the police would be in charge of
the gates.    In league games they were, and the system involved the
filling of the pens one after the other.     In 1985 and 1986 there were
no semi-finals and the problem of a capacity crowd into all the
terrace did not arise.    This may have given rise to any
misunderstanding.


10.     It will be clear that it is our view that the avoidance of
overcrowding in the pens is the key to safety.     The perimeter fences
are needed to prevent pitch invasions and they, or some similar
barrier, are a requirement of UEFA and of the FA: see Doc: 296.      They
are not in themselves the problem, although the gates or means of
egress through them must be adequate to cater for an emergency.        Those
at Hillsborough were not, being narrower than the 1.1 metres required
by the Green Guide.     Provided that the fans are properly distributed
in proper numbers, no problem of crushing should arise.      Indeed,
smaller areas ought in theory to be safer, since they contribute to
ease of distribution.     However, the smaller the area, the greater the
significance of an increase in numbers over the safety limits.


11.         There are other defects in the ground which contributed to the
disaster.     There were an insufficient number of turnstiles to
accommodate the 24,000 or so fans who were to come through them.       The
Leppings Land entrance to the ground formed a natural bottleneck.
Crushes at the turnstiles were, it seems, not uncommon, but normally
they were shortlived and contained well within the perimeter gates.
Unless fans came to the ground over a reasonably long period,
ie. about 90 minutes, and at a reasonably steady rate, problems were
likely.     Furthermore, there was a complete absence of adequate signing
inside the turnstiles.     All fans were encouraged to go down the
central tunnel and would be forgiven for not being aware of any
alternative route.     Suggestions that anyone who had been before,
indeed any fan who knew football grounds generally, would have
realised that they could go round the side of the west stand we found
unacceptable.     The lay out at Leppings Lane was the result of a need
to segregate.     That need had not existed since the 1987 season, but no
changes had been made and no signs put up.     It was accepted by Mr
Mackrell that the club could not at semi-finals comply with the
requirements of condition 28(1) of the Safety Certificate that a
record be kept of the numbers of spectators admitted to the west and
north west terraces respectively.    There were no means of controlling
the numbers on any part of the terrace within the limits of total
capacity.


III. OTHER PRELIMINARY HATTERS
A. Who was to control the fans on the terrace?
1.      The Green Guide clearly places the responsibility of ensuring
the safety of spectators upon the management of the ground, in this
case, the club: see paragraph 23.    The South Yorkshire Police Standing
Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches (Police Doc: 11)
include as one of the specific duties of stewards that they should
prevent overcrowding and ensure that crowd limits in various parts of
the ground are complied with: see Appendix L paragraph 7(a).     The
evidence of all senior police officers from Chief Superintendent Mole
at the outset has been consistent.   The police did not expect there to
be any stewards on the terraces and no active steps were to be taken
by anyone to control or direct spectators on the terrace so as to
avoid overcrowding.   The fans were expected to find their own levels.
If the central pens became overcrowded, the fans would either turn
round and go back up the tunnel or disperse by the gates at the rear
of the radial fences to the adjoining pens.     The police in the control
room would keep an eye on the pens and, if overcrowding was detected,
should take steps to stop more coming in.     Alternatively, although it
was not part of the match operational order, police officers on the
perimeter of the pitch and in the west stand would report any problems
to Control to enable them to take necessary action.     The club was
clear that it had no responsibility for the management of the fans on
the terrace and said there was an agreement, not in writing or
specifically recorded (pace Mr Lock whose evidence in this regard we
consider unsatisfactory: such an agreement would in our view
necessarily have been recorded somewhere), that the police should take
on that responsibility.     At league matches, it seems that the police
did manage the pens.    At semi-finals, the arrangement was as described
above.


2.       In the light of the evidence, which is all one way, it is in
our view futile for the police to attempt to suggest that the club and
not they were responsible for the safety of the fans on the terrace.
It is interesting to note that in Harris v. Sheffield United Football
C l u b , South Yorkshire Police asserted that their responsibility went
beyond maintaining law and order and extended to the safety and
comfort of the fans.    This is not at all surprising, since it was
accepted in evidence that the police were concerned with the safety of
everyone in the ground.    There certainly ought to have been a clear
and explicit written agreement between the Club and the police to
ensure that there was an effective means of maintaining and
controlling the numbers going into the pens to prevent overcrowding
and its attendant dangers.     It was a grave defect that not only did
no such agreement exist but no arrangement at all was made which
produced any effective means of avoiding overcrowding.       The policy of
allowing the fans to find their own level was dangerously useless:
Dr Eas t w o o d ’s description of it as ridiculous is clearly right.
Furthermore, the monitoring of the state of affairs in the pens by
Control was ineffective.     It is quite extraordinary to find that Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield could look at a photograph of pen 3 at 2.45
(Composite II DB16/29) and say that there was still plenty of space in
it.   There manifestly was not, particularly when one bears in mind
Dr. Eas t w o o d ’s evidence that people tend to avoid the very front
because it is below the level of the pitch and so the view is poor.
That evidence of Mr Duckenfield is a good example of the conditioning
referred to in 11/5 above and the dangers of reliance on visual
monitoring.    It seems, too, that the view from the control box           tended
to give a false impression.       No field glasses were available and the
camera, which could have been used for close-up shots, was defective
and in any event not used at the material time because those in the
control box were concentrating on the problems outside the turnstiles.
The police failed to make it clear to the officers who could have seen
the numbers building up that they should report to control; there was
nothing to that effect in the Operational Order or any briefings and
Mr D u c k e n f i e l d ’s evidence that he expected the officers to report
those matters is not credible.       There was no system to deal with
overcrowding and the problem does not appear to have been foreseen.
This is surprising since in 1988 the tunnel was blocked off to prevent
more going into the central pens, which was overcrowded although not
dangerously so.    That was not reported in the course of any debrief
and was unknown to Chief Superintendent Mole or any senior officer
involved in the planning.      It ought to have affected the 1989
operational order.


B. The decision to give Liverpool the Leppings Lane end
1.       Chief Superintendent Mole made it clear that he would only
agree to police the semi-final at Hillsborough if each t e a m ’s
supporters had the same end as they had had in 1988.           That decision
was in our view justified and it was left to the FA to decide whether,
in the light of it, to choose Hillsborough.     The 1988 fixture had,
according to Mr Eva n s ’ report, gone well.   In fact, Liverpool had then
complained that, although they had more support, they had the smaller
ticket allocation.     In addition their supporters had further to
travel.    Mr Kelly accepted that, in retrospect, the choice of
Hillsborough for the second year running was somewhat unfair to
Liverpool.     It was also unfortunate that Liverpoo l’s complaints about
the choice of Hillsborough for 1989 were not put before the Committee
which had to decide on allocation.     Liverpool and its supporters had
reason to feel unfairly treated.     There were no factors which
militated in favour of Hillsborough rather than Manchester United.
Those set out by Mr Kelly in his evidence are unconvincing.        The truth
seems to have been that it was thought convenient to use Hillsborough
because things seemed to have gone well in 1988.


2.        Although the wrong decision was in our view made, it is
difficult to see how it had any direct connection with the tragedy.
There were no doubt a number of fans who were unable to get tickets,
perhaps more than there might have been had the match been played
elsewhere.     This may have resulted in more ticketless fans coming to
Sheffield in the hope of getting into the ground.     Certainly, there is
evidence of considerable numbers of fans asking for tickets.        It is
clear that after the tragedy, some Liverpool fans were blaming the
allocation of ends.    We do not think that an inference can be drawn
from that that large numbers of ticketless fans gained admission.           In
the shock and confusion things were said which were not properly
thought out.    There is no reason to change the opinion stated in
opening this inquiry that a disaster such as this could have occurred
at any semi-final and that, if Nottingham Forest supporters had been
allocated to the Leppings Lane end, an Inquiry might well have been
considering why some of them were crushed to death.


C. The testing and collapse of barrier 124A and the removal of 144
1.      Two sections of barrier 124A in pen 3 collapsed as a result of
the overcrowding.   There can be no doubt that that collapse caused a
number of deaths.   The barrier had been tested by Dr. E as twood’s firm
in July 1988 and had passed.


2.      The test had been carried out      in accordance with
Dr. E as twood’s interpretation of Annex C to the Green Guide.    The
force of 6.0 KN/metre width has to be applied for three 5 minute
periods, a record being kept of the amount of deformation during each -
loading and of the percentage of recovery.     If the recovery is less
than 50% after the third application of force, there is a failure: if
it is 50%-75%, there must be a retest.     As may be apparent, the
question is 50% or 75% of what?    Is the recovery by reference to the
position of the barrier before the first application of force or
before the third?   If the former, a span of 124A recorded 53% and
should have been retested; if the latter, it recorded 100% and passed.
 Dr. Eastwood adopted the latter and so passed it.     He justified his
interpretation in evidence.    We think   he was wrong and that safety
ought to have dictated that the recovery     must be by reference to the
position of the barrier before the first application of force.       But we
do not think we can be criticised for adopting his interpretation,
because it is fairly open on the language of Annex C and has some
support from the tests in the British Standards.
3.        Although the collapse of the barrier caused deaths, there were
many who died elsewhere in pens 3 and 4 and, if it had not collapsed,
fans would in all probability have been crushed to death against it.
In his statement, Dr Eastwood said that it was in his view "reasonable
to believe it failed on 15th April 1989 because it was subjected to a
significantly greater crowd pressure than is envisaged in the 1986
Guide".     That evidence was not challenged, since it is manifest that
the gross overcrowding in pen 3 would have created an excessive
pressure.     The vertical run behind it to barrier           and the
diagonal run to the tunnel side of the pen at the top would have
increased that pressure.     There is no certainty that the different
interpretation and a retest would have led to renewal of the barrier
or that, even if it had been renewed, it would have survived the
pressures exerted upon it.     Furthermore, even if it had survived, it
is difficult to say that lives would have necessarily been saved.        It
is incidentally unfortunate that Dr Eas twood’s test records were
incomplete, since the test of one out of three of the spans was not
recorded.     It happens that in the case of 124A the one omitted was the
one which survived.


4.        We should also refer to the removal of barrier 144 in 1986.
This did materially affect the capacity and we think that insufficient
consideration was given to the adverse effects of the removal.      It
made it all the more important to regulate the numbers going into the
pens; this no-one seems to have appreciated.     Its removal made it the
more easy for fans coming down the tunnel to spread out into the pen
and we believe that its absence did result in a greater flow down the
pen. The evidence of Inspector Bullas, who was looking down from the
west stand, of a sea of people flowing down the pen is graphic and
consistent with the sort of movement one would expect.       A number of
fans spoke of being carried down the pen from the tunnel as they
entered after Gate C was opened and we know that at least 20 of those
who died came in through Gate C after 2.52 (a fact which gives the lie
to the opinion expressed in some quarters that drunken late-comers
killed those who had arrived in good time) and some of those ended up
at the front of pen 3.


D. The Police Planning
1.      The police operational order for 1989 was essentially a
reproduction of that which had apparently worked well in 1988.        So
much was this so that it omitted to include the instructions to the
police Tango units to assist the ambulance and fire services to make a
rendezvous point at Herries Road Bus garage as had been agreed in
August 1988: see Doc:477.      This omission might have been important: in
the event, despite the emergency that arose, it seems to have made
little difference.   Since there had been a minor pitch invasion at the
end of the 1988 match the Order underlined the instruction to serial
1, the offices on the perimeter track, to forbid anyone "access to the
track from the terraces without consent of a senior officer (except to
receive medical attention)".     In this context, senior officer meant an
inspector of higher ranking officer.     Thus it was drummed into all
officers that access to the pitch must not be permitted except in the
most exceptional circumstances.     This led to the failure to react
quickly enough to the emergency that in fact arose.     Police were
conditioned to believe that any attempt to come out of the terraces
must be a pitch invasion and therefore must be prevented.      In
addition, there was insufficient planning to deal with the arrival of
fans at the turnstiles.     It was assumed that they would arrive in a
steady flow and that there would be no build up. It is interesting
that there was a considerable body of evidence from fans to the effect
that in 1988 there had been a much higher profile policing en route to
the ground.     Fans coming down Leppings Lane had been stopped and asked
if they had tickets and steps had been taken to weed out those who had
not and to control those going to the turnstiles.     Some witnesses even
talked of a recollection of barriers across Leppings Lane.     The police
denied that there was any difference and there is nothing in the
Operational Order which suggests any change, save for a reduction in
numbers of officers posted to public order duties away from the
ground.     It may be that the relatively smooth running of things in
1988 has led people to think there was more control than in the chaos
of 1989, whereas in fact there was no material difference.     In any
event, it is clear that in 1989 insufficient consideration was given
to tRe possibility of the arrival of large numbers at once or to the
problem of a substantial number of latecomers.     The need to control at
a distance from a ground was identified in 1926; that lesson was not
learnt at Hillsborough.


2.         The plan had been operated in 1988 by Chief Superintendent
Mole.     He had considerable experience of overseeing the policing of
Hillsborough.     He was moved to a new post at the end of March 1989 and
was succeeded by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.     Mr Duckenfield had
little recent experience of policing football grounds and had not been
to Hillsborough for some 10 years.     That was, of course, not his
fault.    He inherited a plan which had appeared to work well and was
content that it would work well again.     He did not have the experience
to recognise all the potential problems.    This was not his fault, but
we feel that he should have taken more time and greater care to
familiarise himself with the ground and all its problems.
Alternatively, Mr Mole could have been asked to deal with the match,
notwithstanding his new posting, since to require that Mr Duckenfield
should be in control if such an important match with a capacity crowd
so soon after his appointment was to ask a great deal of him.


Ill    SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989
A.    The crush at the turnstiles
1.        Because of the need to segregate Liverpool from Nottingham
Forest fans, 12 turnstiles which normally were used to gain access to
the North Stand from Penistone Road were not used.    This meant that
all 24,000 Liverpool fans had to enter by the Leppings Lane
turnstiles.    1-10 were allocated to the 9880 in the North Stand, 11-16
to the 4465 in the West Stand and A-G to the 10,100 on the terrace.
This meant that there was considerable pressure on the turnstiles and,
assuming a hoped-for rate of 800 an hour was achieved, it would have
taken well over an hour to get everyone in.    Any hold ups would have
increased that time.    The design of the ground made this imbalance of
turnstiles inevitable and it is a defect which undoubtedly contributed
to the disaster.


2.        It was essential that there should be no impediment to the
smooth operation of the turnstiles.    However, there are a number of
things which did cause fans to congregate outside the turnstiles and
to obstruct and delay the entry to the ground.    In particular, we
would identify the following matters:-
(i) The confusing nature of the tickets coupled with the
signing outside the turnstiles.    1-10 were marked A, 11-16 C
and A-G B, so that they ran ACB.   B was the other side of a
wall to A and C, so that anyone getting himself on the wrong
side had to extricate himself and go to the other side.
Furthermore some of the signs placed to show the appropriate
colour coding of the relevant turnstiles were too low and
invisible once a substantial queue built up.    Police officers
said that there were numerous queries from fans as to where
they should go and that the signing was not at all good.      The
Club ought to have made sure that the tickets and signs were
clear.


(ii) The activities of ticket touts.   There were touts. . . . . .
operating, albeit not in large numbers, in the vicinity of the
Leppings Lane turnstiles: one at least was arrested for
obstruction.   Touts are a menace because (a) they encourage
fans to come without tickets in the hope of being able to buy
one, (b) they sell supporters tickets for the wrong end of the
ground, thus imperilling the segregation of the fans and (c)
they cause obstruction.   Ideally, they should be barred from
the vicinity of any ground, but there are difficulties in
devising a means of curtailing their activities without
preventing the perfectly lawful and unobjectionable swapping
or selling of tickets other than as a business.
(iii) The presence of ticketless fans.     The evidence makes it
clear that there were many fans asking for tickets.      Police
officers on duty at and near the turnstiles give various
estimates of the numbers, ranging from 200 to 2000.      Fans have
told the inquiry that much more was done in 1988 to try to
weed out the ticketless than in 1989.    Whether or not that is
right, very little was done in 1989.     The police told the
inquiry that there was little they could do, since no offence
was committed in being near a ground without a ticket,
provided there was no obstruction or breach of the peace.         We
do not think the police are so powerless.     Ticketless fans do
cause problems and, in sufficient numbers, are almost bound to
cause an obstruction.   It is in our opinion perfectly
reasonable for a police officer to ask a fan if he has a
ticket and, if he has not, it is lawful to refuse him access
to the immediate vicinity of the ground.     Such refusal can be
justified on the basis of an apprehended obstruction.      In any
event, we suspect that in many cases an indication by an
officer to a ticketless fan to go away would suffice.


(iv) Some ticketless fans tried to get in by bribing turnstile
operators or by rushing or climbing over turnstiles.      Others
with tickets for the Kop tried to get in the Liverpool end.
Both of those categories of people delayed the turnstiles and
affected the smooth running of entry to the ground.
3.          By 2.30pm all pretence at orderly queueing had ceased and
there was a crush of fans at the turnstiles.         Although, according to
the operational order, officers outside the turnstiles had inter alia
to form orderly queues, the Inspector in charge (Inspector Sykes) told
the inquiry that that was an impossible task when a large crowd
attended.      By 2.40pm or thereabouts the police had lost control.      The
crush got worse and worse and the gates had to be opened.         Attempts to
save the situation by the use of mounted officers failed.         Despite the
views of Inspector Hand-Davies, which must be given considerable
weight, it seems to us that the area was too confined to permit of
effective action by horses. T h e y did not have sufficient room to
manoeuvre and were enveloped by the crowd since individuals were
unable to move away, there being nowhere to move to.         Superintendent
Marshall himself was overwhelmed by the crowd and his efforts to
alleviate the crush were ineffective.         At some stage, an attempt was
made to shut the perimeter gates and to form a barrier of horses to
prevent new arrivals coming down Leppings Lane joining the back of the
crush and so making things worse.         This tactic seems to have
succeeded, at least for a time, but it was too late, for, very soon
afterwards, Gate C was opened.         Evidence was given that, despite the
barrier, fans were forcing themselves through, even going under the
h o r s e s ’ bellies.   The perimeter gates, or some of them, were pushed
open.    The evidence of what precisely happened is confusing.        There is
no doubt that there were fans, particularly among those arriving at a
relatively late stage (i.e. 2.45 onwards) who, perhaps because they
had had too much to drink or because of selfishness or to create
difficulties in the hope of getting an advantage (e.g. admission to
the ground without a ticket) or for some other reason, did push and
shove and exacerbate the position.    But those were a minority.


4.       The manual log kept by Superintendent Murray shows that at
14.17 there was a request to close Leppings Lane.     Mr Marshall and Mr
Duckenfield think the request came later and certainly Leppings Lane
was not closed to traffic until after 2.30.    If Mr M u r r a y ’s timing is
correct, the police outside were aware of problems building up at a
comparatively early stage.    We find it surprising that no measures
were taken by those inside the ground in the control box to try to
seek information to ascertain whether many fans were still coming
towards the ground.   It is also surprising that nothing was done by
the Commander outside to deploy officers to try to control the fans
arriving further away from the ground to create a breathing space.           At
about 2.30, Mr Duckenfield, seeing the crowd at the turnstiles, asked
Mr Murray if they would get everyone in by 3pm.     Mr Murray said he
thought they would.   It does not seem to have occurred to them to
check the turnstile count or to find out how many were to come.         It
should by 2.40 at the latest have been apparent that all would not be
in by 3pm and the kick-off should have been postponed.      It had been
decided that kick-off would only be postponed if there were some
reason other than their own volition which caused late arrival of a
substantial number of fans.   This was to adopt too inflexible an
approach.   Postponement might not have eased the crush, but, since it
was accepted by many witnesses that things got worse nearer to 3pm
because fans did not want to miss any of the game, it might well have
done.   If a dangerous situation was created, it should not have
mattered what caused it.        If postponement of the kick-off might
reasonably have overcome the danger, it should have been done.


5.        All the police witnesses concerned in the policing asserted
that they did not foresee that there would be so many arriving late,
and at once.    They go on to suggest it was unforeseeable.      We
disagree.    It is, we would have thought, not in the least surprising
that fans should be reluctant to spend many minutes       standing on a
terrace or, for    that matter, sitting in a seat with very little in the
way of entertainment provided.       There was some evidence of knowledge
by the police that fans were developing a pattern of arriving 15
minutes or so before kick-off because, it was thought, they were
seeking alcoholic refreshment elsewhere since they could not get in
the ground: see    Doc: 434A.    This was not particularly referable to
Liverpool fans,    but, on the day, the police were at a fairly early
stage aware of a considerable amount of drinking by supporters.           It
was a fine and fairly warm day, such as would encourage people to sit
around in the sunshine.     It was an all-ticket match, so that fans
would be forgiven for believing that it would not take very long to
get in.


6.        In any event, we do not think that those who arrived Ihour
before kick-off can properly be branded latecomers, particularly since
the tickets said spectators should be in their places by 2.45.          It was
taking up to 20 minutes to get through the crush and into the ground.
Once the crush developed, there was more difficulty in getting through
the turnstiles which worsened the crush.
7.         It has been said that, had the fans not pushed, the problem of
crushing would not have arisen.       This is a superficially plausible
view.   But it ignores the reality of crowd behaviour.       It has not been
seriously suggested by any police officer that the mood of the crowd
up to about 2.30 was other than good natured.        It is precisely because
people who are aiming to go to a particular place through a limited
means of access do tend to crowd together that there is a need for
control.     And, as one witness said, once you are in that sort of a
crowd, you only move forwards or sideways, never backwards.        Sideways
was constricted, so all were tending to move forwards.


8.         We should refer to other factors which have been suggested as
causative of the crush.


           (a)   Ticketless Fans
           As we have already said, it is very difficult to estimate the
           number of ticketless fans.     It has been suggested that there
           were a substantial number who were determined to get into the
           ground without a ticket.     There is some evidence, notably
           from Mr Taylor, the effect of which is that some fans were
           overheard expressing the intention to get in by way of an open
           gate or to cause a gate to be opened.     Attention is drawn to
           the arrival of large numbers of Liverpool fans at all-ticket
           League matches in the hope of gaining admission.     And it is
           pointed out that at this y e a r ’s Cup Final there were up 1000
           fans who had come to force an entry to Wembley Stadium.        We do
           not doubt that there probably were some fans who came without
tickets determined to gain entry.      But we find it impossible
to accept that the crushing was caused by such fans so as to
engineer the opening of a gate, a theory propounded by
Superintendent Greenwood.      (See Day 12, p.95).    That would
have involved a truly amazing degree of preparation and good
fortune.      However, there may well have been a number of fans
who took advantage of the situation and were happy to
exacerbate and make use of the crush.      Opportunists probably
did hope that a gate would be opened and that they would get
in through it.     To that extent, ticketless fans may have
contributed to the difficulties at the turnstiles.


(b)   Drink
Many witnesses, particularly the police, refer to a large
consumption of alcohol, mainly lager.      Fans arrived in
Sheffield in good time but then stayed outside the ground
drinking, either at pubs or in public places.        Some police
officers suggested that the ban on the sale of alcohol in the
ground contributed to this pattern of behaviour.        It was
pointed out that, having regard to the crowds, those seeking
drink inside the ground, if it was permissible to sell it,
would be unlikely to succeed in getting more than a pint (i.e
a single drink).      It does certainly seem that a significant
number of fans did decide to take advantage of the sunshine
and drink so that they arrived comparatively late and in a
condition affected by alcohol.     The drink had increased
selfish and stupid behaviour, leading to pushing and a
         failure to take any notice of police appeals to hold back.
         There was a considerable amount of boorish and loutish
         behaviour (e.g. urinating in gardens or backyards, throwing
         empty cans all over the place, shouting, swearing and
         chanting) which sadly tends to be associated with football
         crowds.   That sort of behaviour is inexcusable.    But it was a
         minority of fans who were guilty of it and it did not cause
         the trouble.   It probably contributed to the inability of the
         police to alleviate the trouble once it had arisen.


         (c)   Hooliqanism
         This is really coupled with the taking of drink, although
         those may well have been fans who did not need drink to behave
         in a thoroughly antisocial fashion.   Police horses were burnt
         with cigarettes, there was pushing and shoving and some fans
         behaved in a thoroughly selfish way, concerned only to get
         themselves into the ground without caring for the comfort or
         safety of their fellows.   But this sort of behaviour was that
         of a minority and did not cause the problem.   The primary
         cause of the crushing was the bottleneck at Leppings Lane, and
         insufficiency of turnstiles and a failure by the policy
         properly to control fans arriving before they reached the
         perimeter gates and the turnstiles.


B.   The opening of the gates
1.       At 2.47 Superintendent Marshall radiped the first request tp
ppen gates.    Grpund cpntrpl was fpcussing pn gate C and   sp   it was that
gate that was expected to be opened.          At 2.48 it opened to eject a fan
and some 200 or so outside burst in.          This happened before Mr
Duckenfield was able to decide on an answer.          Shortly afterwards the
request was repeated, again that the gates should be opened.            Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield realised that to open the gates would be to
act contrary to all the planning and# would let unsearched and
possibly ticketless fans into the ground.          He had a difficult decision
to make and he took his time making it.          Unfortunately, neither he nor
any of his advisers in the control room took any steps to prepare for
the consequences of opening Gate C in particular.          The inevitable
result would be an influx of fans down the central tunnel and into
pens 3 and 4:      this should have been foreseen.      Mr Murray attempted,
he says, to contact Mr Lock, but was unsuccessful.          Otherwise, no
attempt was made to contact or to warn the stewards- in the club.            The
suggestion that the officers on the concourse ought to have acted on
their own initiative does not bear examination:          they did not know
that the gate was to be opened nor did they know that pens 3 and 4
were already full.          In fact, by 2.50 pens 3 and 4 had reached their
safe capacity.      This should have been obvious to those in the control
box.   Even if it was not, steps should have been taken to prevent the
large numbers who were bound to come through Gate C from going down
the central t u n n e l .


2.        At 2.54 the teams came out onto the field.        This resulted in a
roar from the crowd, encouraging entrants to the ground to hurry to
their places.      So it was that the greater portion of the 2000 or so
who entered through Gate C went into pens 3 and 4.          They came in in an
orderly fashion, glad to escape from the dangerous crush outside.            At
2.58 Gate A was opened, but this time there was some preparation
inside, largely because of the foresight of Sgt. Higgins.       Mr
Duckenfield took additional steps by deploying a serial to the front
of the North Stand to cater for that influx which might have caused
trouble to the seated customers in that stand.      Those standing on the
terrace were left to fend for themselves.


3.       It is clear that the failure to take any steps to prevent fans
going from Gate C to pens 3 and 4 was the effective cause of the
disaster.     The decision to open the gates cannot be criticised:     the
failure to foresee the result can.


C.   Inside the ground
1-       It has been submitted that avideo shows     activity in pen 3
suggesting that the barrier broke before 2.52.      We do not find that at
all likely.    It is contrary to the evidence that is available from
fans who were in the vicinity of that barrier.      It is also less
probable, since a surge in an overcrowded pen was far more likely to
have done the damage.     It was believed at an earlier stage of the
inquiry that the surge of fans coming in from Gate C, coinciding with
the arrival of the teams on the pitch, caused the collapse.      The
evidence now available suggests it may have occurred later, possibly
even as late as 3.05, when the hitting of the bar at the Nottingham
Forest end caused a surge on the terrace.     There is much conflict, but
it seems that by 3.02 or thereabouts, when Gate 3 had been opened
properly, a pile of bodies was already obstructing it.
2.          Since no steps were taken to prevent it happening, the pens
got fuller and fuller.      As they did, people began to be crushed to
death.     Some fell to the ground and were asphyxiated as a result:
others were unable to breathe standing up.         Almost all died from
traumatic asphyxia - the crush was so great that they could not
breathe.     As this happened, they began to cry out in distress.         The
police officers at the perimeter fence were slow to react, partly
because they were accustomed to overcrowding, partly because the noise
level made it difficult to hear that the cries were of people in real
distress and partly because they were conditioned and instructed to
DajLHMvi*
            the integrity of the pitch.    PC Hooson told the inquiry that
he came past the North Stand and, as he approached gate 4, he realised
                                           Uc
that fans were in distress and he tookjjjpon himself to open Gate 4.
This was sometime between 2.55 and 3pm.         Thereafter, Gate 4 remained
open.     PC Illingworth, the officer on Gate 4, does not agree; he says
he opened that gate.      It is possible that it had originally been
opened by PC Illingworth and shut again and then reopened by PC
Hooson.     But insofar as there is a conflict of evidence to be
resolved, we would submit that PC H o o s o n ’s account is to be preferred.
PC Illingworth must feel himself open to criticism; PC Hooson has, on
the face of things, no axe to grind.


3.         Gate 3 was opened, according   to PC Smith, by the force of the
fans in the pen.     He shut it again.    The same happened again and it
was only then that he appreciated the need to keep it open to try to
help to extricate the injured.      This account, courageously given, is
corroborated by fans.     Dr Eastwood accepted that, given sufficient
pressure, the gate could have opened in the way described.
                                          31



    4.           It is not possible to say precisely when the gates were
    opened,      since the videos available were not focussed on the pens at
    the crucial time.      The photographs in Composite Album II show gate 4
    open at      15.00 and gate 3 at 15.02.    Videos show both gates closed at
    15.00:45 (MAP 1) and gate 4 open at 15.00:50 (MAP 3).         The earliest
    that Gate 3 is shown open on a video is 15.03: 49 (MAP 8).         All this
    makes Mr Gro be l a a r ’s timing very suspect and his description of the


•
    various moves in the match is not borne out by the video of the game.


    5.        Not only was there a slowness to react to the situation in the
    pens, but also, once fans had begun to climb over the perimeter fence
    (at about 3pm), the immediate reaction was that it was a pitch
    invasion.     This was unlikely for various reasons, not least because
    (a) the fans did not go on the pitch and (b) there was no conceivable
    cause for an invasion at that stage of the game.         Valuable minutes
    were spent while those in the control box tried to find out what was
    happening.


    6.        Attempts were made by standing on the perimeter fencing and
    gesticulating to get those at the back of the pens to move back.
    These attempts failed.      This was not in the main due to cussedness
    on the part of the fans, but to (a) an inability to move and (b) a
    failure to realise what was going on down the front.         No senior
    officer thought to send police down the tunnel to haul fans out the
    back - that was left to the initiative of junior officers.
7.         There was an absence of leadership by the senior police
officers.     Individual efforts were made to try to save lives and to
evacuate the pens, but the picture was one of chaos and lack of
organisation until Chief Superintendent Nesbitt came on the scene at
about 3.15.     No attempt was made to use the tannoy to try to summon
medical assistance until about 3.20.        Similarly, those not directly
involved, particularly the Nottingham Forest fans on the Kop, were
left ignorant of what was happening.        Chief Superintendent
Duckingfield defended his decision to say nothing on public order
grounds.     We can quite see that fans had to be kept in their places to
avoid interference with the emergency services, but we think that some
announcement should have been made.       Most football fans are decent
law abiding people and, if treated as human beings, are likely to
react s e n s i b l y . W h e n an announcement was eventually made, the fans
all behaved w e l l .


8.         The club had an agreement with the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance
Brigade to provide sufficient numbers to comply with the requirements
of the safety certificate.       Their members did all they could when the
tragedy occurred.       SYMAS had very prudently, by stretching the
relevant DHSS guidelines, determined that two of their personnel
should attend the ground with an ambulance.        Two complementary tickets
had been provided for league games, but not for semi-finals.           It did
appear that there could be some criticism of the club for withdrawing
the tickets, but we heard from Mr Mackrell, and we have no reason to
doubt,that it arose from an administrative error.         In any event, the
personnel were at the ground and able to react quickly.          There was,
however, a lack of proper liaison with the police, largely because the
police had no plan specifically to deal with a disaster at
Hillsborough Stadium.     The same comment applies in respect of liaison
with the fire service, who were eventually called to produce bolt
cutters to remove the perimeter fencing.       The first fire officer to
arrive was told he w a s n ’t wanted.   In addition, there was confusion
between the club and Dr Purcell as to his role.       He thought he was
present to administer to the team or directors and was not the
physician referred to in the safety certificate.


9.      Much publicity was given to the attempt by the police to
summon the fire brigade and the conversation seeking to identify the
precise location of Hillsborough Stadium.       It would be unfair to blame
the fire brigade operator for her endeavours to get the r i g h t —
information for the computer.      She expected the police to be precise
and there ought to be full briefing so that the police know what is
needed of them.     There was some confusion as to what was needed from
the fire brigade.


10.     Complaints have been made of the lack of proper medical
equipment.   We do not think any football club could reasonably be
expected to carry sufficient equipment to cater for a disaster of the
magnitude of that which occurred.       But there should have been at least
a resuscitator.     The SYMAS ambulance had all necessary equipment and
oxygen was quickly available.      It became clear that a defibrillator
would not have been a sensible piece of equipment to use in the pitch.
 We were not impressed with the complaints made by Dr Ashton and Dr
Phillips in that regard.
11.      Although there was confusion and disorganisation and a failure
to act as expeditiously in summoning the necessary assistance as was
desirable, we doubt that the delays caused deaths which would not in
any event have occurred.     We do think that, had the perimeter fence
been opened earlier and positive steps taken to get people out of the
back of the pens, some lives might have been saved.         But we doubt that
the delays in seeking medical aid and a sufficiency of ambulances made
any real difference.     As was pointed out in evidence, the first 4
minutes are crucial and immediate mouth to mouth resuscitation is the
only really effective and practical treatment.         This was given by
police officers, St. J o h n ’s personnel, fans etc.


12.      Much ill-feeling was generated by the allegation made that
afternoon that fans had taken down a fence and thereby caused the
tragedy.    This version was given by Mr Duckenfield to Mr Kelly at
about 3.15.     Mr Duckenfield has admitted that he deliberately did not
tell the truth.     That account had been given to the fire service and
to SYMAS.     There was scope for misunderstanding, since the call to
SYMAS may well have referred to the forcing of a perimeter gate.           That
possibility of misunderstanding cannot exonerate Mr Duckenfield.


D.    Radio Communication
1.       Radio communications were generally poor.       This was largely
due to the fact that over 100 officers had radios and so, particularly
as the situation became more difficult, there was a tendency for more
than one to talk at once.     In addition, shortly after 2.30 a problem
was apparent and the control box seemed to have lost transmission.
The reserve station was brought into use.    This was so badly sited
that it was impracticable to use it.    Hence the control box had to use
a set instead, thus losing the ability to switch to non-talk through
so as to override all other transmissions.    It did gain the advantage
on talk through that it was able to compete on equal terms with the
other officers.


2.       The situation was wholly unsatisfactory.   Many messages did
not get through.   Officers on the perimeter were not heard trying to
announce that there was crushing and asking for ambulances.
Superintendent Marshall could not get through his request to open the
gates and had to route it via the police station.


3.       Since an inspection by a Home Office expert has disclosed no
faults, the breakdown must have resulted from too much traffic on the
air.   Too many officers had radios for the system to cope.     Clearly,
consideration will have to be given in Stage 2 to means of improving
communications and avoiding the problems which arose.


IV.1    As will be apparent, we have not sought to cover all the
matters dealt with in the evidence.    We have not thought it necessary
to suggest the resolution of disputed evidence as to who said what and
when in relation to numbers still to come into the ground.      No doubt,
those matters are important to the individuals involved.      It is
possible that some people ought to have been aware of things which
should have led them to take action which might have changed events.
We are not satisfied that identification of the shortcomings of
individuals in those sorts of respects will help the Tribunal in its
task.   No doubt the parties concerned will, if they consider such
incidents to be important, deal with them in the course of their
submissions.


2.      This was a wholly avoidable disaster, but one which was bound
to occur so long as nothing was done to control the numbers going into
the pens and to provide a sufficiency of turnstiles and
policing to avoid a dangerous build up of fans seeking admission.
Luck prevented it happening before; that luck ran out on 15th April
1989, with the tragic consequences which have led to this Inquiry.     It
is clear that there must be education of all concerned, police,
stewards, spectators, so that overcrowding can be the more easily
recognised.    Ignorance, complacency and lack of foresight, not
deliberate callousness, led to the disaster.    Perhaps the lessons can
now be well and truly learnt and this will be the last of the series
of inquiries into disasters at football grounds which have led to loss
of life and injury.

These recommendations and suggestions have been drawn together from

representatives with various interests within Sheffield City Council.


They are submitted having taken time to assess the effect of the

Hillsborough Disaster, the Inquiry and the Interim Recommendations of Lord

Justice Taylor which are being implemented in Sheffield.
                                                                                     1


                                        Page 2


1.   Clarification and Codification of Legislation

     If the Inquiry is minded to recommend amendments of or additions to the
     existing legislation then the opportunity could be taken to codify and
     clarify the legislation.

     The provisions, which are currently contained in the Safety of Sports
     Grounds Act 1975, the Fire Safety and Safety at Places of Sports Act 1987,
     various Regulations and statutory guidance could be remodelled to create one
     Act and Regulations (with functional statements) requiring certain standards
     to be achieved.

2.   Improvement/Prohibi tion Notices

     The 1975 legislation (as amended) makes provision for the issue of a
     Prohibition Notice to the holder of a certificate. It is suggested that
     consideration should be given to including an intermediate course of action.
     The Health and Safety at Work, Etc. Act 1974 makes provision of the issue of
     Improvement Notices and Prohibition Notices. An Improvement Notice requires
     the employer to carry out certain works within a given time. If the
     employer fails to comply with the Notice, they are guilty of an offence.

     The power to issue Improvement Notices would be a useful intermediate step
     where a Prohibition Notice is not appropriate, but where some formal Notice
     is required.

3.   Periodic Certificates and Inspections

     The Popplewell Report recommended (at paragraph 3.68) that there should be
     (i) annual renewal of safety certificates issued under the Safety of Sports
     Grounds Act 1975; (ii) a duty on the local authority annually to inspect the
     premises prior to re-issuing the certificate; and (iii) power for the local
     authority to revoke the certificate.

     The interim recommendations compliment the first proposal; the second
     recommendation was implemented in statutory guidance after the Popplewell
     Report; the third recommendation has not been acted upon.

     With regard to the fiifst recommendation, annual certificates focus the
     parties' minds on the whole situation and not on a particular application or
     inspection. It tends to promote an overall review of the circumstances
     surrounding the re-issue of a certificate.

     With regard to the second recommendation, it is suggested that prior to
     re-issuing the certificate there should be an inspection, but that there
     should also be inspections on a half-yearly or quarterly basis with guidance
     given as to timing, e.g., prior to renewal, end of season, start of season,
     during season (obviously this is less relevant to multi-use stadia where
     "seasons" are not as clear cut.)

     Visits to the ground should be carried out whilst it is empty and during use-
     but the limitations on "during use" inspections by their very nature must be
     recognised.

4.   Model Safety Certificate Conditions

     The Popplewell report (paragraph 3.81) suggested that model safety
     certificate conditions should be drawn up. A standardised fortn of
     conditions could form the nucleus of all certificates. Additional
     conditions could be added to cover local conditions. This would enable some
degree of national uniformity of application of conditions. It would seem
appropriate,, that the Home Office draw up the standard conditions as it has
done in respect of byelaws for example.

Resource Implications - Fees

At present it is suggested in Circular No. 72/1987 that the statutory
inspection should not result in significant resource implications but that
in general inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days
per ground. This point is made in the context of emphasising the scope of
inspections, together with associated report work and are not intended to be
as detailed or extensive as that often required by the holder of the
certificate.

Clearly, more time is spent on safety of sports grounds than the Home Office
anticipates. The resource implications involved for local authorities and
their advisers from other services to implement the existing provisions and
the new recommendations must be recognised.

Although the certificating authority is allowed to charge fees for dealing
with applications for the issue or amendment of a certificate (by virtue of
the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976) there is no express provision
for fees for the ongoing work of enforcing the provisions of the Act and
dealing with inspections that have to be carried out at least once a year.
The Inquiry may wish to consider whether express provisions should be made
to allow a certificating authority to make some reasonable charge. There
are many examples of legislation where local authorities are empowered! to
charge a reasonable fee to cover the cost of administering and enforcing a
particular licensing function.

Definition of Roles

The Popplewell Report recommended that there should be urgent consultation
between the Health and Safety Executive and the Fire Authorities and Local
Authorities as how best to co-ordinate and communicate their inspections and
reports (paragraph 3.95).

It has again become clear during the Inquiry that a lack of clarity in the
definition of roles, as well as a lack of communication, can cause problems.
This is particularly relevant in relation to the Police who are involved in
the safety.of sports grounds in a number of roles, e.g. a member of the
Advisory Group, upholders of law and order and their role inside and outside
the Ground. It is also relevant to consider if and at what point in an
emergency the role of the safety officer is subsumed by the emergency
services.

Clarification, following consultation, is needed of the different roles
Authorities are required to fulfil and the means of communication between
them.

The Advisory Group

The Police and the Building Authority and, for metropolitan districts
subsequent to local government reorganisation, the Police and the Fire
Authority, have to be consulted by the certificating authority by virtue of
the legislation. Sheffield City Council have included officers from the
Building Authority and Health and Consumer Services in their Advisory Group
prior to this Inquiry.
The legislation therefore, provides the basis of expert opinion on which the
Local Authority makes decisions.

The decision making process can take a number of forms, but perhaps the two
extremes are:-

(a) where all the experts are in agreement that decision is delegated to an
officer of the Council, where one or more experts differ - that decision is
delegated to an appropriate committee of the Council;

(b) the appropriate committee considers all matters relating to works
carried out at the sports ground.

Further guidance could be given over and above that containedin     the interim
recommendations as to the preferred course of action.

In addition to the statutory consultees, together with those recommended in
the Interim Report, i.e., the Ambulance Service, the Club and the recognised
Supporters' Club, consideration should be given as to whether any other
bodies should be involved in the wider Advisory Group, e.g., Health and
Safety Executive.

It may also be necessary to have a consultation group consisting of Police,
Fire, Building Authority, Environmental Health, Ambulance Service in
addition to the wider Advisory Group.

Members should be able to have professional advice from officers.

Pooling of Information

Some consideration should be given to pooling information   onanational
basis to improve the flow of that information.

Information should be available to all certificating Authorities and their
statutory consultees. This would assist to achieve a degree of uniformity
throughout the country and enable all Authorities to learn from each others
experiences.

This is particularly relevant to regional level where the emergency services
will cover a number of District Authorities.

Safety Management and Safety Planning

Sports ground management and promoters must accept safety as essential
aspects of their business and not an adjunct to it. It is essential for
safety responsibilities to be clearly identified and for systems of
accountability to be included. Any regulations or the "Green Guide" could
usefully develop this theme. The term safety planning is preferable to that
of emergency planning in that it makes clear to everyone that the process of
safety planning is exactly that and an appropriate safety plan should
promote better safety standards. All relevant agencies should be included
in the planning process. Safety planning is aimed to prevent disasters as
well as providing contingency plans to ensure emergencies and disasters can
be coped with.

Status and Content of the "Green Guide"

A comprehensive review of the status and content of the Green Guide is
required. The present guide to safety of sports grounds is predominantly
written for football single use stadia. Multi use stadia are becoming more
popular and it is suggested that the guide be expanded to cover spectator
safety requirements pertaining to a wider variety of sports, e.g., speedway,
stock car racing, hockey, archery, shooting, etc. and other potentially
dangerous activities.

In addition, either by expansion of the guide or by the creation of a
similar document, requirements for spectator safety of fully enclosed stadia
should be created.

"Flexibility"

The 1986 edition of the Green Guide, paragraph 6, states as follows:-

"Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without necessarily
detracting from the overall safety of the ground. The variety of type,
function and layout of sports grounds means that a flexible approach should
be maintained to take account of the particular circumstances at individual
grounds".

And paragraph 8 states:-

"It should be borne in mind when using the guide to assess whether existing
circumstances provide adequately for the safety of spectators the criteria
to be aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of safety. It would be
unreasonable, even if it were practical, to seek the absolute safety of
everyone attending a ground".

And, again in paragraph 11:—

"The principles referred to in paragraphs 4-10 above should be kept in mind
by both ground management and, where applicable, by the local authority when
applying the guide to an individual ground. The guide is an aid to, not a
substitute for, professional judgment and common sense".

There is a problem in affording the Green Guide this kind of status. What
is "flexibility" to one mind may be slap-dash permissiveness to another.
Clearly, emphasis on flexibility was and is well intentioned, but the effect
is to produce a code that is not applied tightly and where non-compliance
can be justified as falling within the scope of some flexible discretion
allowed to the relevant authority.

For the future perhaps the Inquiry would wish to consider recommending that
the approach of the Green Guide should move away from that of "flexibility"
to, for example, an approach of the following kind:-

"That the certificating authority, and where appropriate the club itself,
should always seek to establish whether there is some reasonable cause why a
relevant guideline is not complied with, and that in the absence of some
such reasonable cause emerging then compliance with the guideline should be
achieved or insisted upon". A recommendation not to comply with a relevant
guideline should be in writing and approved by the certificating authority.
If such a decision is considered by the relevant committee of the Council
then the public will have access to that information.

Parts of the existing guide could become regulatory and other parts
re-issued (in a revised form) as a guide cf. the majority of the Approved
Documents to the Building Regulations or an "Approved Code of Practice" cf.
status of an approved code of practice under the Health and Safety at Work,
Etc., Act 1974. In the case of documents similar to the Building
Regulations compliance would therefore not be necessary, yet failure to
comply with the Guide could be taken as being evidence tending to show that
the requirements had not been met, unless it could be demonstrated by the
party concerned, using other means, that the requirements of the legislation
had been satisfied.

Specific Recommendations in relation to the Structure and Design
Requirements for a Sports Ground

General Fabric

It is recommended that the headroom for tunnels be increased from 2.4 metres
to at least 3 metres to facilitate overhead viewing of any crushing or other
problems occuring along its length.

Due to the possible risk of explosion, it is suggested that gas
installations should not be permitted in any building in the stadia used for
spectator accommodation, cf. tower blocks.

To cater for different speeds of travel through tunnels or restricted
passageways longer than, say, 5 metres, a minimum of 4 units of exit width
should be provided.

Ingress

Segregation of entrances for supporters of opposing teams is recommended as
a permanent design criteria.

Permanent unobstructed access to the pitch area for emergency vehicles to be
provided in at least two positions, and these being at opposite ends of the
ground (whenever possible).

The "guide" states a maximum notional rate of 750 persons per turnstile per
hour, however it does not state the design time, i.e., the time within which
all spectators are capable of being admitted. It is suggested that a
revised code should state a maximum ingress design time of say, 45 minutes.
For multi use stadia, in particular, investigation of the flow rate should
be carried out as rates may differ, e.g., for families with young children.

Terraces

Where terraces are to be sub-divided so as to avoid major migration and
sideways surge, each section should be formed by inserting radial barriers.
Radial fences should be avoided.

It is considered that spectator accommodation should not be lower than the
pitch level or pitch perimeter path level (whichever is the higher), so that
spectators do not have to step up from the spectator accommodation.
In the present "guide", it states "gradients steeper than 1:2 (26°, 34')
could be dangerous" (paragraph 94). In Table 1 barrier requirements are
specified for terrace gradients of up to 30° or 1:1.7, therefore
contradicting the previous statement. From a graphical interpolation and
extrapolation of all the relevant data the maximum gradient should be 31°,
30'. This equates to approximately 1:1.63.

Crush Barriers - Design

To avoid rusting in unseen and non-maintainable places, overclipped barrier
rail supports should no longer be acceptable. All parts of barriers should
be capable of direct inspection and maintenance.
Welding of all joints would achieve the aims set out in the above paragraph
and will create a structural continuity where the failure of an individual
element would minimise the risk of collapse.

Consideration should be given to the application of horizontal, (in addition
to lateral) forces. This could be taken as 5% of the horizontal force thus
resisting torsional and secondary effects.

The recommended heights of the barrier rails should be re-assessed.
Clarification is also required (preferably by sketch) to show where this
measurement should be taken from. The present "guide" appears to make an
assumption that the barrier rail is in the same vertical plane as the
terrace riser. When these vertical planes differ, the method of height
measurement may also differ. The acid test being at what level a normal
person would stand who was comfortable, immediately behind the barrier.

The opportunity should be taken to re-appraise the required test and design
loads. An increase would achieve a greater resistance to collapse but may
increase the risk of injury due to resisting greater crowd pressures. A
decrease, however, may result in earlier collapse, yet may prevent fatal
injury.

Crush Barriers - Testing

It is suggested that each barrier span should be tested separately (for rail
strength) and then adjacent spans be tested together to determine rail and
support strength.

The specification of the test should be modified to clearly state how
recovery deflection is to be calculated. Such a modification should be in
accordance with the testing procedures in BS 5950 and other similar British
Standard documents.

To avoid any further doubt, a standardised test specification and procedure
is now required. This should include a specification of a standardised
testing rig and a standardised test result sheet.

Stands with seated accommodation

Although steeper gradients can create better forward viewing for the
spectators, very steep gradients will have the effect of creating equally
steep radial gangways and *may create a domino effect during an evacuation
where all persons may be stood - instead of being seated. No maximum
gradient is directly stated in the present guide for seated areas; the only
tenuous reference being to the maximum calculated gradient for stairways in
paragraph 73 as being 34°,9'. It is considered that seated accommodation
greater than 30° should have intermediate crush barriers at approximately 5
metre centres.

Pitch Perimeter Fences

The Popplewell Report (paragraph 4.136 to 4.138 and also Appendix 'E',
paragraph E29) recommended that consideration should be given to the design
of a standard efficient perimeter fence, with proper exits.

As a direct result of the Hillsborough disaster it has been suggested that
spectators may feel reassured by the possibility of forward escape onto the
pitch from all sides of the ground.
If pitch perimeter fences are to remain, it is suggested that at least 50%
of its linear length is openable and such openings are evenly spaced so as
to provide maximum benefit for spectators' safety.

Where pitch side police or stewards require access into the spectator area
through relatively small doors or gates, these may be provided as additional
openings or as wicket gates in the large opening panels.

So as to avoid sudden forward movement, all such gates should be vertically
multi-hinged and open towards the pitch. Collapsible panels should not be
acceptable. It is a further pre-requisite that the release mechanism should
be -

a) capable of being operational remotely in tandem with others;

b) capable of independent opening whilst under crowd pressure, by the
   operation of a quick release, manually operated catch;

c) all opening devices must be capable of use under crowd loading
   conditions.

In order to simplify any new designs of catch for pitch perimeter gates and
bearing in mind the fact that there should be no spectators on the pitch
side of the opening sections of the perimeter fencing, test loading on
perimeter fences could be reduced to, say 3 KN/m.

Estimation of Space Capacity - Terraces

Under the present "guide",.terraces in good condition can be calculated as
capable of holding a maximum of 54 persons per 10 m^, throughout the
available terraced area. It is, however, accepted that some parts of that
area are "peak viewing areas" and as such will achieve in practice a greater
population density due to their popularity. The figure of 54/10 m^ is
therefore an average, without the peak viewing parts being given a maximum
packing density.

It is considered that the 54/10 m^ should be treated as being the maximum
and therefore only be applied to the areas of peak viewing. Other areas of
the terrace should be'calculated as having a lower packing density, say
40/10 m2.

In order to practically achieve the consideration set out in the above
paragraph, it would be necessary to:-

(a)   Define the size and position of "peak viewing areas'1.

(b)   Surround the areas of "peak viewing" using radial barriers as opposed
      to radial fences.

(c)   Determine by effective stewarding or policing that the crowd density
      of each "peak viewing area" is at a satisfactory, safe and comfortable
      level.

Flow Rates

Throughout the Inquiry, the flow rate of 40 and 60 persons per minute per
unit of exit width have been heavily criticised as being based on
inconclusive research. A practical lesson that has been learned is that
                                        Page 9


      when people are very tightly packed, their ability to flow through exits is
      dramatically reduced. Until the outcome of further research is known, it is
      suggested that flow rates are reduced to the following:-

      (a)   "Peak viewing area" of terraces - 30 persons per minute per unit of
            exit width.

      (b)   All other areas - 40 persons per minute per unit of exit width.

      It is considered that the emergency evacuation time should remain at 2 i
      minutes.

12.   Stewards

      Training of Stewards should be carried out by people who have experience in
      training and safety. Training should be regular to remind existing Stewards
      of procedures and ensure that new Stewards receive appropriate training.

      The acceptable age range for Stewards should be specified as being between
      eighteen and sixty five years, in addition to the current requirements
      relating to fitness etc.

      A Steward (or a police officer) carrying out isolated tasks, e.g. external
      gate duty, should be provided with an efficient means of communication with
      the Safety Officer.

13.   National First Aid Guidelines

      There is the need for national first aid guidelines which are drawn up with
      particular reference to occasions when large numbers of people are likely to
      be present, e.g. football matches, pop concerts etc.

      It is also important for the individuals expected to provide first aid to
      receive appropriate training.

14.   Counselling and Support for Victims

      Substantial knowledge and experience now exists about the services the
      public and those directly affected by a disaster need afterwards. These
      responses are informed by an understanding of the potentially long-term
      needs of victims. Initiatives must be taken immediately after the disaster
      without waiting for requests for help and be available for a period of at
      least two years. Their establishment and co-ordination with the voluntary
      sector and between statutory organisations needs to be undertaken on the
      basis of an agreed general plan. The services have to be carefully
      provided, managed and last appropriate lengths of time, if the bereaved,
      survivors and rescue staff are not to suffer lasting damage. These
      co-ordinated services are expensive to provide and outside of the normal
      provision made by local authorities. Therefore their establishment and
      continuance is dependent on new and additional resources being made
      available. Such separate funding needs to be made available.

15.   Public Appeals

      The legal issues surrounding public appeals are complicated, e.g. charitable
      status, tax etc. Guidelines are required on the establishment,
      administration and termination of disaster appeals to ensure that funds are
      distributed as fairly, quickly and effectively as possible.
16.   Pre~Match Entertainment

      Further to recommendation 25 in the Interim Report, consideration should be
      given as to whether pre-match entertainment and associated activities can
      influence the type of crowd attending football matches (in particular) and
      for example can therefore be used to encourage family attendance. Such
      entertainment may also result in staggered entry times.

17.   Day and Time

      Consideration should also be given to what effect changing the day and/or
      time of kick off of football matches, in particular, may have on crowd
      behaviour and therefore crowd safety.

18.   Football Membership Schemes - I.D. Cards

      The Popplewell Report recommends (at paragraph 4.128) that consideration
      should be given to some form of membership scheme for football league clubs
      in England and Wales.

      However, in view of the experiences at Hillsborough, careful consideration
      needs to be given to any national football membership scheme. It would
      clearly be undesirable if any such scheme resulted in significant delays at
      turnstiles.

      There are other practical considerations which must be taken into account,
      e.g., patterns of attendance, different method of entry, space required for
      a complex admission system, i.e., two turnstile systems, number of
      turnstiles required, additional policing/stewarding required to control the
      crowd and eject individuals, where to eject individuals from and how and
      reducing further the ground capacity.

19.   All Ticket Entry

      In order to increase the speed of ingress of spectators, consideration could
      be given to requiring all ticket entry for events where greater than, say,
      70% of the total available capacity could be expected.

BACKGROUND PAPERS USED IN COMPILATION OF REPORT:
Report of the Head of Administration and Legal Department to the General
Purposes Panel


Safety of Sports Grounds -
Proposed establishment of a "Safety of Sports Grounds Forum


1.    Purpose of Report

      To obtain Members' views upon the practical steps needed to implement Lord
      Justice Taylor's recommenda Jtion that a consultation group is set up to
      consider safety issues.

2.    Background

2.1 Recommendation 17 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report reads as follows:

      "To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should
      set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate members of its own
      staff, representatives of the Police, of the Fire and Ambulance Services,
      of the Building Authority, of the Club and of a recognised supporters'
      club. The Advisory Group's terms of reference should encompass all matters
      concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground
      and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from
      the local authority, and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be
      recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
      consideration by the local authority•

2.2   The Policy Committee at its meeting on 26th September 1989 (pages 653 and
      654 of the printed minutes) considered this recommendation and resolved:—

      "(C) .... Authority be given for (i) the continuation in operation in its
      existing form of the Advisory Group which comprises appropriate
      professional officers and is chaired by a senior officer in the
      Administration and Legal Department which advises the City Council in the
      exercise of its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and
      (ii) the establishment of a separate group on the lines now indicated and
      including representatives of the stadia and recognised supporters' club to
      be chaired by an elected member of the City Council, whose function would
      be to make representations to the Advisory Group and through it to the
      Council on matters of particular concern to the group; •••


3.     The Current Situation

3.1   Preliminary steps have now been taken to set up the new Advisory Group
      envisaged by both the Interim Recommendation and the Policy Committee. It
      is suggested first of all that the new Group be called the Safety of
      Sports Grounds Forum" in order to avoid confusion with the Safety of Sports
      Advisory Group which will continue in its present form. Letters have been
      sent to Sheffield Wednesday (copy attached), Sheffield United and Owlerton
      Sports Stadium in which the following issues are raised:—

3.2    Frequency of meetings - it has been suggested that it might be appropriate
       for the Forum to meet approximately once every three or four months,

3.3    location of meetings - perhaps room could be provided at the Town Hall
       or perhaps at other venues in the city (for example club premises);
3.4   issues to be discussed by the Forum - the Interim Recommendation (set out
      above) indicates that matters concerned with crowd safety should be
      discussed;

3.5   visits to football matches - perhaps each member of the Forum should
      arrange to attend football matches at least two or three times per year.

4.    Procedure of the Forum

4.1    It would perhaps be appropriate in the first instance to havea
      preliminary meeting to as to establish the method of operation of the
      Forum. It seems likely that the Forum will probably be serviced by the
      Council.

4.2   In the letters to the Companies it has also been made clear that the Forum
      itself will have no authority as such but the Council would obviously take
      note of any comments which it chose to make. In addition the Companies
      have been asked for details of any recognised supporters clubs as referred
      to in Recommendation 17 so that they too can be asked for their views. As
      yet no response has been received to these letters.

4.3    The Panel may also like to give consideration as to who should chair the
      new Forum; the Policy Committee resolutionindicates that an elected
      representative should perform this function.

5.    Conclusion

      The Panel is asked (i) to note the contents of this report; and to give
      preliminary consideration to (ii) the chairmanship of the Forum; (iii) the
      frequency of meetings; (iv) issues to be discussed; (v) the general remit
      of the forum.

When the various consultation processes have been completed a further report
will be submitted to the Panel on the proposed Forum.

Preamble.

The  Fire Brigades Union are obliged to the Committee of  Inquiry
into  the Hillsborough Football Ground disaster for granting   us
the  facility  to make submission to the Committee on  this  most
tragic matter.

The Submission we make is intended to be constructive in  content
and to be of assistance to the Committee in its deliberations and
ultimately in making recommendations so that such a disaster  can
never  again  occur.

We do not s ee k to a p p o r t i o n b l a m e or r e s p o n s i b i l i t y to a n y            body,

    2.      PITCH     INVASION/PERIMETER             FENCING.

    What   is of concern to the Fire Brigades Union is that Mr Justice
    Popplewell acknowledged in his Final Report that to deal with the
    base problem of pitch invasion, a change in English law should be
    made   in line with Scottish law to recognise pitch invasion as  a
    breach   of the peace offence.  We are not aware that this  change
    has been made.

    This does seem to give powers to the police to deal with the root
    cause  of  pitch invasion and appears to operate successfully  in
    Scotland  where  the  incidence of pitch invasion  and  thus  the
    need for the provision of perimeter fencing is much lower.

reflected           in    the Ho me O f f i c e Guide.             Training          of      stewards        is
obviously critically important,                          yet,      o n c e a g a i n in      t h e m e d i a it

  SUBMISSION ON PART ONE OF THE


       HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



           ON BEHALF OF



SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


               AND


      CIVIL DEFENCE AUTHORITY
                    THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE FIRE SERVICE ON
                       15TH APRIL, 1985, AT HILLSBOROUGH




1-(a)      It is not suggested in the light of the evidence                               tendered

           at     the    Inquiry      that     the         earlier summoning of the Fire

           Service would have resulted in the saving of lives or                                   the

           prevention         of     injuries.        Nevertheless          it is regrettable

           that     notwithstanding           the         obvious        need     for        cutting

           equipment,         once     it    became         apparent       that       persons were

           trapped behind the perimeter fence in pens                             3    and    4,     no

           request       for   the      Fire     Service           to attend was made until

           15.13.45.      Every appliance carries cutting equipment which                                 H ornsby
                                                                                                          2 0 .7 3 .F
           could        have       speedily         removed          the   perimeter          fence.

           Emergency tenders also carry heavier duty portable cutting

           equipment      which       could,        if      necessary, have been used to                  2 0 .75-C


           remove the radial fences.



     (b)   Chief Superintendent Ouckinfield accepted that by 15.04 it                                     D u c k in fie ld
                                                                                                          8 .1 07.E -P
           was     apparent to him that people were trying to get out of

           the pens and that           they      were           having   difficulty          getting

           through      the    gates.       Although he accepted that an obvious

           solution would be to cut some of the fence down, he stated

           that    the    thought       did      not        immediately pass through his

           mind.     It is noted however that at 15.07                       a    request          from   S .A .I.
                                                                                                          P . 11
           ground control for a fleet of ambulances was made.



2.         Calling the Fire Service

     (a)   Following      a    request for bolt cutters made at about 15.12

           by radio from the area              of         the    perimeter       fence       to    the

           ground       control        box       at        Hillsborough,         Sgt.    Goddard,         G oddard

           immediately telephoned the                     police     garage      at     Claywheels

      Lane     asking    for    cutting       equipment.       They     replied that

      they     had   none    available        and    Sgt.     Goddard        therefore     G oddard
                                                                                           1 8 .97.P -H
      signalled to PC Bichard who was also in the control box to

      radio Police       Control      at   Snig      Hill     to    call     the    Fire

      Service.



(b)   PC Bichard passed the following message on the VHF channel                           S .A . 1
                                                                                           P . 16
      to Force Control at 1513.



             "Hillsborough ground control             could    you     contact       the

(c)   This    request    was    overheard by Chief Inspector Edmundson                     Edmundson' s
                                                                                           a d d itio n a l
      and he went       to   the   adjacent         operations       room    to     give   sta te m e n t


      instructions to one of the operators.



(d)   Meanwhile,        in      the operations         room
                                                                                           W e b s te r's

      which it was thought people were trapped and                     lives    might

      therefore be at risk.



(e)   Chief Inspector Edmundson interrupted Miss                                 call
                                                                                         Edmundson' s

(f)   The conversation between Miss                       and Miss       Davies     is

      recorded     in    the   transcript of the Fire Service tape and

      the part relating to Hillsborough took                   from    15.13.45     to

      15.14.58, a total of 1 minute 13 seconds.



      Comments

(a)   It    is   to be noted that although the message passed by PC

      Bichard to Force Control complied with the requirements of

      the   emergency procedure in that the precise location that

      the Fire Service were to attend and the type of                        equipment

      required    were     specified,     Miss                 who spoke to Miss

      Davies made no mention of Leppings Lane or                  the need         for

      hydraulic     cutting     equipment.       This      procedure had          been

      agreed upon at       a   meeting    between         the     three emergency        C ore
                                                                                         478
      services on the 9th August, 1988.



(b)   Inspector     Sewell     accepted       that the necessity to provide

      such information to the Fire Service was obvious and                       that    S e w e ll
                                                                                         31 .32.A -P
      the Fire Service was entitled            to expect such details from

      the police.       By contrast, such        detailed       information       was

      provided     by    police   force       control     at    Snig Hill to the         C la rk e

(c)   Miss Davies whose call had been interrupted, had                                   to   make

      sure that she had satisfactorily dealt with the Gatty Road

      fire whilst at the same                  time          trying   to     deal    with      the

      police request for assistance at Hillsborough.



(d)   She     needed      to     know the address of Hillsborough Football

      Ground to make           sure      the       appliances         were        sent   to    the   D a v ie s
                                                                                                     2 0 . 4 0 . C-D
      correct     place and as quickly as possible from the nearest

      fire stations.             She was, in our               submission,        entitled      to

      expect     that       police        force          control would know the place

      where    the        Fire    Service          were        required      as    they       were

      presumably already in attendance. If more detail as to the

      location could in fact have been provided , it                                could     have

      caused     an unnecessary delay,if she had mobilised the Fire

      Service to the district of Hillsborough. This                                would      have

      been     the appropriate alternative procedure in the absence

      of such information.



(e)   She asked for the            road       three          times    whilst       typing      the

      information          into    her        computer         and    the     first      enquiry

      produced       an    answer        unrelated            to   the     question.           The

      address,     Penistone            Road,          was     finally     provided by Miss

      Davies' supervisor, Mrs



(f)   If the police at Snig Hill had relayed                          the     message         from

      the    computer       by     Miss       Davies          and produced an immediate

      'special risk' response.

     (g)   Miss Davies needed to know the nature of the                         incident       at

           which     the    Fire        Service was required to attend so that a

           decision could be made as               to   what      type    and     number       of

           appliances         should     be     sent.      In    the     circumstances the

           statement that there had been a                  major      accident     was       not

           helpful      and      it     is unfortunate that PC Bichard's request

           for hydraulic cutting equipment which would have indicated

           the   need      for    emergency        tenders was not relayed to Miss

           Davies.

 THE     INVOLVEMENT         OF THE FIRE SERVICE AS A MEMBER OF THE

                   OFFICERS' WORKING PARTY



The Fire Service as a member of the Officer Working                         Party

and     later the Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group gave

advice to the local authority.



Until 7th September, 1987, the Fire Service was designated

the     primary    authority         for   means     of    escape    and     fire   Co r e 27


precautions.           Thereafter      the      Fire Service         area     of

responsibility         was    defined      as    fire     precautions,       fire

alarms, means of escape, emergency                 lighting        and    stadium

capacity.         It   was    recognised        however that the areas of           Co r e 418


potential overlap of responsibility was                    quite    extensive.

It had been pointed out on the instructions of ACFO Seaman                          Seaman
                                                                                    2 0 .5 3 .E -H

may well be thijf Mr Bownes            did      notappreciate        the     full

significance of these reservations.                  The    source of advice        2 9 .1 0 2 .H -1 0 6 .A


for the effect on holding capacity of the structure of the

terrace     including        crush     barriers      was     the         Building

Surveyor's Department.



Thus,     for example, when the removal of barrier 144 in pen

3 was discussed and determined on 7th August, 1986, it was                          C a lv e r t

on how holding capacity would be affected, if at all.



The local authorities, through               their      representatives       Mr
                                                                                    Bownes
Vaughan     and    later      Mr   Bownes,       were responsible for co­           2 9 .1 0 0 .C -1 0 1 .B


ordinating the work of the Working Party.                     It    was    their
duty on the basis of the advice received,                              to       effect      any

necessary        amendments              in   the Safety Certificate.                 On 5th

June, 1986, the City of                    Sheffield        Metropolitan          District        Core 312


Council,        informed the Fire Service that a re-draft of the

Safety Certificate would shortly be complete but the first

draft     was     not     sent           to the Fire Service until 7th July,                      C ore    387

It was appropriate for the                      Fire      Service     to     give      their

advice     on    means         of    egress          in    an   emergency         with the

following considerations in mind:



(a) The holding capacity of the pens would not                                  exceed      54

    persons per 10 square metres



    Paragraph           15.3        of    the 1976 Green Guide, states that                        1986 G r e e n         G u id e

    the number of people that can be                            safely       accommodated

    in     a    terrace         is       either the holding capacity or the

    capacity of the exit system.                          The Fire       Service       makes       Seam an

    very        low     fire    risk.           The       maximum holding capacity

    namely 54 persons per 10 square                          metres      permitted          by

    the     Green       Guide,           when     applied to the total area of
pens 3       and     4    would       produce        speeds     of    evacuation

through their respective exit systems which were below

Service        regarded         as    the     safe     limit.        The holding

capacity to be determined by the                      Building        Surveyor's

Department         on     the    basis       of the construction of the

pens including the state and                      position      of    the     crush

barriers       was       likely      to be less than the maximum and

would       therefore       produce          an    even    more       favourable

evacuation time.



The     club    and/or the police                 would be able to control

the numbers of spectators entering the pens.



A plan for separate turnstiles for different                            sections

of the terrace was considered privately by Dr Eastwood                                Eastwood

     (c) Such       capacity       would      provide       for reasonable ease of

           movement.




           Even with the maximum holding                  capacity        permitted       by

           the    Green     Guide,      the      density      of spectator packing

           would permit ease of movement through the pen                           and     it

            is most unlikely that a serious crushing problem would

           occur.      The       Fire   Service      video          and     photographs

           demonstrate            the      maximum         density        of     packing

           contemplated by the Green Guide.



4.   The gates in the perimeter fence and in the radial fences

     in the west terrace.



     These were never intended by the Fire Service to cater for

     the    numbers       which    were admitted to pens 3 and 4 on 15th

     April, 1989.         When the perimeter gate to pen 3 was opened,

     many    persons       were     already lying across the mouth of the

     gate and it is, in our submission, highly                       unlikely,        even

     if    the     gate     had    been       1.1 metres wide, that evacuation

     could have been conducted at such a rate as to                            save      life

     or           prevent           serious               injury.           That           is

                                           - 9 -
not to say that the gates would not have been adequate for

the    kind of emergency which could reasonably be envisaged

if the appropriate holding capacity had been adhered to.



Perimeter Fence Gates



(a) Paragraph 18.3 of the 1976 Green Guide                          requires       that
                                                                                              1986 G reen G u id e
      access to playing pitches must be made as difficult as                                 P a ra g ra p h 209


      possible in normal circumstances whilst providing                             the

      police      with       proper           access to the terraces for crowd

      control and enabling the pitch to be used in the event

      of     a     serious           emergency.         Paragraph        7.9.1   which

      requires that such fences be provided with                           gates    for

      use    in    an emergency does not stipulate the frequency

      or minimum width of such gates.



(b) Paragraph 215 of the 1986 Green                         Guide   provides       that

      perimeter     gates            should      have    a minimum width of 1.1

      metres subject           to     paragraph         6   which    accepts       that

      deviation         from       individual       guidelines       are    possible

      without necessarily detracting from the overall safety

      of    the   ground           and    paragraph 8 which states that it

      should be borne in mind that, when using the Guide                             to

      assess       whether            existing          circumstances        provide

      adequately for the safety of spectators, the criterion

      to    be    aimed        for       is    that of a reasonable degree of

      safety.

   evacuated        in the event of an emergency which required

   total evacuation.             The gates were intended for use                  in

   the      event of local emergency to permit the evacuation

   of a relatively small             number       of     spectators       and     to

   allow access by the police.

   to     the    rear,     and    the    placing of exit signs on the

   perimeter fence         gates     would        be     likely    to     attract

   the police at the time that too                  many   spectators        had

   been allowed to escape rather than too few.



(h) It     is     a    requirement of paragraph 7.9.2 of the Green                 (19 86 G reen G u id e )
                                                                                   P a ra g ra p h 215
   Guide 1976 that perimeter gates should be                    controlled,

   so      that       immediate      access     to the pitch or perimeter

   track can be ensured in the event of an emergency.                         It

   follows        in     our   submission that if they are to be an

   effective safety measure:



    (i)         There must be an awareness by those controlling

                the    packing       of the pens of the possibility of

                crushing among the spectators.



    (ii)        There must be constant vigilance to ensure that

                any difficulty or problem           within   the      pen     is

                noted.



   (iii)        Prompt action must be taken to open the gate or

                gates     if   the        need arises. In relation to the
                                                                                    Core 140

          his     only       criticism of his senior officers was

          for not opening the gates earlier.

          Superintendent           Duckinfield          had    concluded, in

          the light of the discussions and information he

          eventualities, particularly crushing,                        was     not

          referred to.



          Thus on or before 15th April, 1989 the officers

          on the ground do not appear to have                        been    made

          aware    of     the dangers of crushing in the pens,

          particularly if they became overcrowded.

        irrelevant to do so if the policy of permitting

        the     spectators              in    the    west        terrace to find

        their own level was adopted.                        There was also             a     D u c k in f ie ld

          maximum holding capacity i.e. 54 persons per 10 square

          metres and steps had immediately been taken to prevent

          further spectators from entering the                    centre         pens       by

          closing       the tunnel and the radial gates, any crushing

          problem that arose could have been safely resolved                                by

          evacuating an appropriate number of spectators through

          the perimeter fence gates.              These would have permitted

          evacuation at a rate of at least 60 persons per minute

          per pen (attributing to each gate only one unit width,

          namely 0.55 metres.)

   widths      at    the tunnel for pen 3 provide                an exit time

    of 5 minutes 38 seconds for 1015 spectators and the                            3

   unit     widths     at   the tunnel for pen 4 provide an exit

   time of 5 minutes 45 seconds for 1,036 spectators.



(b) In compliance with paragraph 6.13 of                  the     1976      Green

   Guide an alternative exit route was provided, although

   its possible use in an emergency was regarded                        by       the

   Fire     Service    as   extremely          remote.      The alternative

   routes were through the radial gates each of which are

   of   two    unit    widths.       Thus pen 3 could be evacuated

   through the gate into pens 1 and 2                  in    8    minutes         27

   seconds and pen 4 could be evacuated through the gates

   into pens 6 and 7 in 8           minutes       38     seconds.         I t     is

   submitted        that     if    an    announcement        was     made         to

   evacuate the whole of           the    west     terrace,        spectators          Seaman 23 . 59 .G - 6OB

   prevent pens 3 and 4 being overcrowded by migration of

   spectators from the outer pens.                However,          paragraph

   50   of the 1986 Green Guide states that a smooth, free

   flow through an exit route             to    the      outside     is         best
   achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance

   to the      exit      route.     The   provision    of     a    wider     or

   additional gate in the radial fence would be likely to

   hinder the free           flow    through    the   alternative          exit

   route      via    the north and south ends of the west stand

   in that spectators would be entering                the       outer     pens

   from the centre pens at a greater rate than they would

   be leaving them.



(d) It would have been            undesirable   to    mark       the     radial   E astw o od
                                                                                  2 7 .7 6 .D
   gates or exit routes since that would                   in an emergency

   be likely to deflect spectators from the preferred and

   speedier     exit route even when the tunnel was open and

   available. Furthermore, the gates served not merely as                         Seaman
                                                                                  23.4.C-E
   emergency        exit    routes    but were also there to enable

   safe distribution of the spectators to take place.



(e) When the radial fences were approved               by    the        officer

   Working     Party         on 11th September, 1981, it was made a               C ore

   condition that           the new gates in the radial fences               at

   the   rear       of      the terrace should        be    under       police

   control.         It      was clearly understood          by     the     Fire
                                                                                  Seam an's s ta te m e n t

   gates being constantly manned. It was a matter for the

   police     to     decide       how many officers were deployed to

   carry out that function.



(f) Paragraph 7.9.2 of the 1976 Green Guide required                      that

   access     points       through a pitch perimeter fence should

   be "controlled so that immediate access to                     the    pitch

   can   be    ensured        in    the event of an emergency". The

                              - 17 -
   condition        imposed        in   relation       to    the radial fence

   gates should have been read in this context.



(g) According to Superintendent Stuart, the requirement of                             S tu a r t
                                                                                       3 1 .1 0 8 .D -H
   the     Working       Party     that     the      radial gates should be

   under police control was interpreted by the police                             as

   a     conditional      control         in   the    sense that the gates

   would only       be    manned        when      segregation    was        taking

   place.      There      is     no     evidence      that     this       was ever

   discussed or given approval by the Working Party.



(h) In our submission, in order to control the numbers                            in

   pens 3 and 4 it was essential to man the radial gates.                              Evans
                                                                                       2 6 .2 5 .D -E
   If further entry into pens 3 and 4 was to be prevented                              2 6 .2 6 .B -E

   by    closing     the central tunnel, it would be necessary

   to prevent or at least control                  movement     through          the

   radial     gates.      A police officer or officers stationed

   at the back of the terrace could have supervised                              the

   packing     of    pens      3        and 4, directed spectators,              and

   notified police control when the                   pens    were        reaching

   their      appropriate           capacity.         Furthermore,          in    an
                                                                                       E astw o od

   spectators to the presence of the gate and                        assist       in

   the      passage       of       spectators        through     it.       In    our
                                                                                       S e w e ll

   properly     carry      out      these      functions      without        being

   "swamped"     providing              the maximum       possible        holding

   capacity      envisaged               by the    Green Guide         was       not

   exceeded.



                               - 18 -
(i) It    appears that on 15th April,                    1989      spectators          did

    not    leave     pens        3       and 4    by way of the radial gates

    after serious difficulties had arisen within the pens.

    The    Fire      Service         anticipated that were the gates in                      Seaman
                                                                                             2 2 .1 5 1 .D -E
   the radial fences to be                  used       for    this      purpose,        an

    announcement         on      the      public       address       system to that

   effect would be made.                  If     there    had      been     a    police

   officer on duty at the gate he would have been able to

   make spectators aware of the existence                          of     the        gates

   and     assist        in    keeping         the     gangway clear.           Had the

   number of spectators in each pen                      been      kept     even       to

   their    maximum           possible holding capacities, permitted

   by the Guide, relatively                     free   movement       towards         and

   through the radial gates would have been possible.

                           IN SUMMARY



There       is no justifiable criticism that can be made of the

Fire Service as to the manner in which they                      responded            to

the    call     for    assistance         at 15.13.45.        The request came

from South Yorkshire Police               Headquarters         Force          Control.

The    Fire    Service     in    the       interests      of    a    prompt          and

appropriate response were entitled to proceed on the basis

that    the    police    would       be      able    to   provide details of

precisely where their appliances were to                      attend          and    the

precise      purpose     for    which        they    were required.             On the

basis of the information that had been                    passed         to    Police

Force Control, all such information was in fact available.



In    any    event,    even     if any criticism can justifiably be

made against the Fire Service on this score,                        in    view        of

the    times    involved,       it   had       no causal       connection with

deaths and injuries sustained in the disaster.




In so far as there was any delay in the                      updating         of     the

Safety Certificate, that was neither caused by, nor was it

the responsibility of the Fire Service.




As regards the pens on the west terrace, and in particular

the    perimeter      fence     gates        and    radial     gates, the Fire

Service, in giving        advice        to    the    Working        Party,          were
entitled       to     proceed      on the basis that the Club and          the

police would control the numbers in, and the safe                      packing

of,     the    pens.        Even    if the numbers in the pens were as

high as the maximum possible holding capacity permitted by

the     Green Guide, it is submitted that the perimeter fence

gates and       the    radial       gates    would    have   performed     the

functions       for    which       they   were intended.      The perimeter

fence gates would have permitted the                  safe   evacuation    of

sufficient       numbers to resolve any local crushing problems

that could reasonably have been anticipated as                   likely    to

occur     in   those        circumstances.      The    radial gates, with

appropriate         directions,      would    have    provided     a      safe

alternative         means     of    escape from the centre pens if for

some reason, which was regarded as               highly      unlikely,    the

tunnel was to become blocked.
        Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

        fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,              the     police     felt

        that    they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

        they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

        from     the     proposals,    the    Officer    Working   Party     saw    no

        objections to their implementation.



        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                   at

        the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

        of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                  It    was

        agreed      that   Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

        Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-



        a)     further     calculations required by the Building          Authority

               being satisfactory




        b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

               gates at the rear of the terrace           and



        c)     the new     gates at the rear      of    the   terrace    also being

               under police control.



               It    was clearly understood by the representatives of the

               Fire Service that these gates would be constantly manned

               and   they    would    not     have approved the proposal if the

               situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                 the

               perimeter     fence    gates    were never contemplated for use

        2.11(ii)         above    that     the approval of the scheme was subject

        to.



(iv)    On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                           South

        Yorkshire         County    Council       declaring that work on the radial

        fences was substantially complete.                   Whilst this had not           been    Ex   43


        previously         brought    to    the attention of the Officer Working

        Party,      there had been three first team home games since                         the

        fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

        and were satisfied with the new arrangements.



(V)     On the 23rd        December,        1981,     the        Chief    Executive     (South

        were satisfactory.



(Vi)    On    the    8th    January,       1982      the    Chief     Fire Officer sent a

        memorandum to the Chief             Executive            (South   Yorkshire     County     Ex   45


        Council)         dated    8th January, 1982 confirming that the radial

        fences were considered to be satisfactory.



(vii)   On the 20th January, 1982, South Yorkshire County Council

        wrote to Eastwood and Partners                  commenting on the fact that
                                                                                                   Ex   46
        the matches played at the stadium since the                        installation      of

        the   barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

        and   satisfactorily          effected       the     segregation         of   opposing

        groups      of    fans.      It    was      noted    however,      that the entire



                             - 19 -
         section of the terrace had yet to be given to                       one       group    of

         fans.



         There    was     also      comment from the police that existing crush

         barriers       extended        up    to   and       completely    through          radial

         barriers       at    a    height      of 4'6" or so, thus enabling fans to

         easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.



(viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                  &    Partners     wrote       to   South
                                                                                                     Ex   47
         Yorkshire       County Council replying to the police observations

         with regard to crush barriers being up                    to     and     through      the

         radial barriers.



         Mr    Eastwood       observed        that if the crush barriers were to be

         removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                     the    radial       barriers,

         there    would       be    a    consequent          loss of calculated spectator

         capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                              view.

         However,       from      the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

         width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.

         Wednesday       Football        Club      was   held on 4th February, 1982 in

         order to       discuss         the   apparent        difference    of     opinion      on

         certain     aspects        of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

         these being the observations of the                     police    in     relation      to

         crush barriers passing adjacent to the new radial barriers.



         It    was   agreed        that,      on    balance, it was preferable from a

         safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                          the    existing

         barriers       being      extended up to and/or through the new radial



                                  - 20 -
              barriers than to completely prevent                      persons      being       able    to

              climb from one pen to another.



2.12   (i)    A     meeting       of    the        Officer       Working   Party     and      Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                         January,        1985,    in   Ex 49

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.



              The     club recalled the practice followed inconsultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                                 the

              rear     of    the       west        stand    at    certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by            erecting       of     temporary     barriers.          This     had

              worked    well       but        in    all    other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim for                      exclusive      use    by    visiting

              supporters          of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                    supporters     was      small     and     the

              weather       was     inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.



              It was agreed that the club would                      consider      atsome       future

              date,     a    scheme       for       permanent       barriers at the rear of the

              stand.



       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                              South

              Yorkshire        County     Council,           enclosing      sketch      plan     6705/2,
                                                                                                             Ex 50
              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                            the    visiting

              team's     supporters           as     they     entered      the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The     scheme       involved         the    construction        of two new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs of fencing                        and    new     gates.       It

              provided       for       separate       turnstiles for the three sections of

              the west terrace that then existed.

                                       - 21 -
(iii)   A meeting of the Officer                  Working      Party      was   held    on      18th
                                                                                                       Ex 51
        April,       1985    to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

        Leppings Lane end.



        The police were           already           familiar   with       the   proposals       and

        indicated      that       they        had     instigated     them because of their

        desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

        and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

        vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                           circumstances

        dictated       and   to        achieve such arrangements for ingress that

        would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.



        At the meeting, the police suggested                        the   provision        of   two

        further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

        in half and running from the tunnel                     entrance        to   the     pitch

        side     security        fence       with     gates    to permit entry to either

        section as appropriate, the other dividing the existing north

        end    of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

        back of the terrace.



        In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

        radial       fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

        through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                         radial      fence     at

        the    north    end      of         the   terrace      to    have two gates and the

        existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

        a second gate.



        The    provision         of    the second gate in each of the two radial

        fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                              access

        to     all     parts           of     the     terrace       to    control    any     crowd

                             -    22    -
disturbances.          It was felt by the Fire Service however,                         that

only     one       gate in each fence would be necessary for means of

escape.



If the above features were implemented, the                          proposed       radial

barrier       running     parallel      and    2     metres          from the existing

barrier at the north end of the terrace                     could          be    dispensed

with     as    the    police     felt   that        they    would have more than

adequate control for segregation purposes with                             the    creation

of     the     smaller pens.      The creation of smaller pens was also

seen by the police to be a bonus in that                        by    having       smaller

sections       of    crowd,     their job in maintaining order would be

made easier.



At the meeting, the revised             proposals          outlined         above       were

sketched       on    to   the    drawing      by     Mr    Grimshaw, of the Fire

Service and the main concern he expressed was                                                  Ex 50



(a) whether the external gates and exit routes created at the

rear    of     the    stand     would   be     adequate          for the numbers of

spectators in each section of the west stand and terrace,



(b) whether the numbers of spectators being allowed into each

section       of    the   terriace   could      be    controlled            to     prevent

overcrowding, and



(c) what arrangements were to be               made        to    ensure          that   the

gates in the radial fences would be readily available for use

should lateral movement           along       the    terrace          to    alternative

exits become necessary.



                      - 23 -
Items        (b)    and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                            for     ensuring

that     emergency             evacuation      procedures      were       adequate         and

controlled and had               experience     with     the      club     of     ensuring

correct       crowd        density      packing.      The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                           proposals           for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                   could

be initiated should this become necessary.                          As far as correct

density       packing        was    concerned,        the    police       stated          that

arrangements            that     they    had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                 on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the     light       of    these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                            to       a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.



It      was         agreed       that   R   Grimshaw        (Fire      Service)          should

investigate as a               matter    of    urgency      the     means       of    escape

aspects            of      the    proposals     and    subject       to     satisfactory

clearance of these matters, the outline                       proposals          submitted

would     be        agreed       as now amended by the suggestions of South

Yorkshire Police and, to                 the    submission        of     the     necessary

detailed           plans    and    calculations        under      both the Safety of

Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.
    (iv)   (a)   On examination of the plan             by    the    Fire    Service,      the
                                                                                                 Ex 50
                 width    of    the    exit     gates    to    allow for the number of

                 spectators that it was anticipated would                    use   them    was

                 calculated      and it was decided that the gates would have

                 to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

                 With     regard     to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

                 that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

                 position      had     little    effect on the existing situation.

                 The capacities, travel distances and                 exit     arrangements

                 from the two new central pens did not change.                      In fact a

                 new gate through the pitch perimeter                 fence    was    to    be

#                provided.       The new radial fence at the north end of the

                 terrace       did    actually     slightly     increase      the     travel

                 distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

                 the terrace otherwise there was no change.



           (b)   It was not thought necessary to              sign    any     exit    routes

                 because:



                 (i)    the    principle        ingress/egress       route would be that

                         already familiar to users, and

                 (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                         stewards on the spot.



           (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

                 be     necessary,     this     being reflected by the request for

                 two additional gates in the newly created pens.                      The use

                 of     the gates was under the direct control of the police

                 and was to allow their access into                 the     terrace    should

                 any     disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

                 of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

                                - 25 -
      becoming      ill    or    overcome to be removed by that route.

      The police, had always been happy that                     the      gates       were

      adequate for these purposes.



(d)    It    was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

       fence would be used for the                evacuation of each              section

      because       (i)    the   risk    of       fire    in the west stand and

      terrace was low and (ii)               it   was    considered         that        the

      height     and      strength     of    walls       and   gates outside the

      Leppings Lane end. were such that the                    risk       of      a    door

      being     forced      or   the    walls       scaled       and    fans thereby

      entering in large numbers was remote.                    At      no    time       was

      there any suggestion to the contrary.



       If     any     situation        arose       that     necessitated              total

      evacuation of the central pens this would in                          the       first

       instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

       i.e. the tunnel.          Should the tunnel          be      obstructed          for

       any    reason,      the   gates       in the radial fences              would be

      used as directed by the police with                   the      assistance          of

      the public address system.




On    the 30th April, 1985, South Yorkshire County Fire Service

wrote to South Yorkshire County Council                     indicating that             the

new    crowd        control      arrangements        were      considered          to    be

satisfactory providing           that       certain      gates      had     widths       as

indicated      on    the    plan     attached to the letter and that the

gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.
    (Vi)     On the 2nd May, 1985, South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

             Eastwood and Partners            indicating that the proposals outlined
                                                                                                     Ex 53
             for crowd      control      arrangements          were    generally     acceptable

             subject to      points a - d set out in the Officer Working Party

             minutes dated 18th April, 1985, and (v) above.



    (vii)    On the 8th may, 1985,            Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

             Yorkshire County Council            acknowledging the comments of the

             Officer       Working       Party      but        requesting      that      further
                                                                                                     Ex   54
             consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

             in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                          in

#            an   emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

             each    occasion,         the   expense      of    which    would      hardly      be

             justified.



    (viii)   On     10th   May, 1985,         South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

             Eastwood and Partners            indicating        that    the   two     additional     Ex   55

             gates    were       included     primarily at the request of the police

             who had indicated that they            were        prepared      to   concede     the

             request       for   the    two    additional gates subject to all other

             points raised by the Officer Working Party being incorporated

             into the proposals.

             Eastwood and Partners            noting that the Chief Executive (South

             Yorkshire       County      Council)    had       been    made    aware    of     the

             application         for    Building    Regulation/planning             approval    in

             respect of the re-organisation of fences at the Leppings Lane

                                   - 27 -
        On    the    19th July, 1985, Stn.O                noted      that plans which

        had been submitted to Sheffield             City      Council     for      Building         Ex 57

        Regulation approval were different to those discussed between

        the club and the Fire Service.



(xi)    On the 25th July, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                           South      Ex 58

        Yorkshire      County      Council    enclosing       copies     of drawings in

        respect of segregation of            visiting      spectators      at      Leppings

        Lane    end,    these being further to the preliminary submission

        in April, 1985.        Amongst these drawings           is     Plan       NO.6705/8A        Ex 59

        which       showed    a revised layout and which abandoned the means

        whereby separate turnstiles would be used for each sector                              of

        the    terrace.      The proposed new wall between turnstile 17 and

        the rear of the west stand was shown as                 having        a    door       for

        personnel       access     described      on Plan No. 6705/14A as being a                   Ex 60

        timber door being 838 x 841 x 44mm.                Plan No. 6705/17             showed      Ex 61

        the proposed new pen arrangements for the west terrace. Under

        this arrangement, spectators would gain access to pens 1 -                              4

        inclusive       from turnstiles 17 - 23 now A - G and to pens 5, 6

        & 7 from turnstiles 9 - 1 3 .



(xii)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party was held on 29th July,                               Ex 62

        1985    to     discuss     the   detailed plans submitted to the South

        Yorkshire County Council on             25th    July,    1985.         Subject         to

        certain      points      detailed    in   the minutes the proposals were

        considered to be acceptable.              Item (i) made reference to                  the

        need    for     a    new   perimeter      fence gate now marked No.3                  for

        security access and emergency egress purposes.                    Item          (j)    of

        the     points       required    that     all   the     new    gates       be     fully

        supervised by stewards who must be               fit,    able     and       properly

        trained.

                              - 28 -
         Also     at    this     meeting,      at item (h), reference is made to a

         proposal to have either              a     pitch    perimeter       fence      gate    or

         radial       barrier(s)       at    the front corner of the Spion Kop "to

         overcome possible lateral crushing hazard when                          large    crowds

         are present" "in view of experiences last year"



(xiii)   On     1st    August,     1985,      Eastwood and Partners wrote to South                    Ex 63

         Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                        comments      of    the

         Officer       Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood                           Ex 62

         asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

         extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2m

         wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

         for     use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

         the 2m gap from the terrace which would be under the                            control

         of     the    police.     With respect to the provision of stewarding

         for all the new gates, (item                 (j),    of    the     minutes      of     the

         29th July,       1985).       Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

         doubt be taken care of by the club.



(xiv)    A    meeting    of    the     Officer       Working       Party    and       Sheffield       Ex 64

         Wednesday       Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

         out the "summer" inspection and in                   particular         to     view    the

         Leppings Lane end improvements.                  The matter for clarification

         dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

         it     was    noted     that there was an existing gate in the new 2m

         wide gap for use by the police.                  Again     it     was    stated       that

         these        gates    would        still    be     available      for    the    use     of

         spectators in an emergency as the gates at                        the    top    of     the

         terrace       under     the control of police would enable spectators



                               - 29 -
to be directed down the 2m wide gap, although it               was      agreed

that steps or a longer gate would be required.



Also    at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end            (as   discussed        at

the meeting of the 29th        July, 1985 - see 2.12(xii) above).

There    were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

at the Spion Kop end.       Unlike the gates in the fence            at   the

Leppings    Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                 terrace

having     to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

calculation of evacuation time from the Spion Kop.



A meeting of the Officer       Working     Party    was    held    on     22nd

January,     1986,    to   discuss     further   development      proposals

involving the Kop and to carry out the "winter" inspection of

the stadium.



The     police       representatives    confirmed   that    the      revised

segregation arrangements to the rear of the west stand worked

well on the majority of occasions.
3.    History: After local government re-organisation



3.1   At     a   meeting          at    the     Hillsborough ground in the summer of 1986 (not

      minuted) attended by the police, the local authority (Mr                                 Bownes),      the

      Building         Surveyor, the Fire Service (Mr Grimshaw) and Dr Eastwood, the

      police asked that consideration be given to the removal of the southern

      half       of    the        crush     barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

      Officer Working Party.                   The matter was discussed and approval given                    to

      the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.



3.2   A    Home       Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                Ex 66

      October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re-issued Green Guide.




3.3   A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                    Ex 67
      Council asking for Fire Service Comments in writing as to the condition

      of     the       stadium         under    the      1975    Act.        It asked for any outstanding

      matters requiring attention to be detailed.



3.4   An inspection of the                  Hillsborough         ground      was   carried     out     on    17th

      November, 1986.



3.5   On     18th      February,            1987,    a    letter       was   sent by the Fire Service to
                                                                                                                    Ex 68
      Sheffield City Council in response to their                              letter    of   3rd    November,

      1986.           This    was       a    comprehensive         letter     covering matters that were

      considered             as    requiring        attention      throughout         the      stadium.        In

      particular             it   was       recommended         that    a    satisfactory security device

      easily openable from                  the     pitch       side    be    found     and   fitted    to    all

      perimeter fence gates.



                                                  - 31 -
3.6   A    meeting    of     the Advisory Group was held on the 10th March, 1987, in

      order to discuss the contents of the Fire                      Service    letter   dated     18th   Ex 10
                                                                                                          Ex 68
      February, 1987 (and Sheffield City Council's proposals for divisions of

      responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working                           Group

      (see 1.14 above).



      With regard to the letter of 18th February 1987, it was agreed that the

      contents should be taken up with the club. Stewarding and the                          securing

      of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated that existing

      arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                            and

      unlocked       for    the whole of any period that the ground was in use for a

      designated purpose.



      The Fire Service also pointed out that the new                      guide    now   included     a

      section      which     defines         in   detail, management responsibility.             It was

      recommended by the Fire Service that the club certificate specify as                            a

      condition that this section be complied with.



3.7   On    28th    March,      1987,        a    copy    of a draft letter from Sheffield City
                                                                                                          Ex 69
      Council to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club dated 19th March, 1987 was                             Ex 70
      received by the Fire Service for their comments.



      The    letter        referred     to       the     fact   that the police, Fire Service and

      Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                      the    condition   of     the

      stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                       At that time,

      no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

      had    indicated       that     they        were    quite    satisfied with the stadium and

      indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                         was     very

      satisfactory.




                                             - 32 -
      The     letter       then     pointed      out    that   the Fire Service had a number of

      comments to make and these were to be                    attached        in    the    form        of     the

      letter    of     18th       February.        It did not however include further points

      that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                            meeting          held     on

      10th March.



      Following        a    telephone      conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

      this omission, a copy of the                 letter,     annotated        with       the    additional

      points was returned to him .



3.8   Prior    to the Leeds/Coventry FA cup semi-final on the 12th April, 1987,
                                                                                                                      Ex 71
      a representative of the Fire Service attended a site meeting                                 with        the

      police at the Hillsborough ground.



3.9   On     22nd    April, 1987, an amended copy of the letter previously seen in

      draft was        sent       by   Sheffield       City    Council     to       Sheffield      Wednesday

      Football       Club.        On    this occasion the further points discussed at the                             Ex

3.10 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was sent to                      Sheffield         City     Council           (see

      1.13     above).         The      letter    concluded      by    requesting          that        Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club be contacted in order to                          discuss          the    matters

      contained        in     the      letter    sent    by the Fire Service to Sheffield City

      Council on 18th February, 1987.



3.11 On 7th July, 1987, a letter was received from                         Sheffield         City        Council

      enclosing        the new draft certificate conditions.                    The conditions were a                 Ex lb
      first draft only and in basic                    form,   not    tailored        to    the        needs    of

      individual            stadia.       Also     enclosed          was   a    first      draft        of     the

      interpretation section of the certificate.



                                            - 33 -
    Comments on the conditions were requested, preferably in writing.



3.12 On 6th August, 1987, the annual inspection at the                      Hillsborough      ground

    was     carried      out     and   attended      by the Fire Service, police, building                 Ex 68

     surveyor      the     Health      &    Consumer         Services      Department     and       the

    Administrative          & Legal Department of the local authority.                  Dr Eastwood

     attended on behalf of the club.                All matters contained in the letter of

     18th    February,         1987,   were    discussed         with Dr Eastwood who tended to

     agree with most of the points.



3.13 On 13th August, 1987, a reply to Sheffield                     City    Council's     letter     of
                                                                                                           Ex 75
     7th July      was sent by the Fire Service giving their observations on the

     draft safety certificate conditions. Amongst other matters:



     (a)    in     relation      to    condition         10(a)   which    dealt    with     stewards

            preventing         overcrowding by ensuring crowd limits in various parts

            of the ground were complied with, It was "difficult to imagine how

            this     task      could   be controlled by stewards" and that "the matter

            should be considered further".



     (b)    in relation to condition 10(i) which dealt with stewards complying

            with     instructions          given    in     emergency     by the police "reference

            should be made to the opening and securing open of                      exits     on    the

             initiation        of any emergency procedure or at the end of a game and

            to assisting and directing the spectators out of the exits".



3.14 On 21st October, 1987, a copy of a letter, dated                       15th   October,        1987,

     from     Sheffield        City    Council to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was

     received by the Fire Service.                 The letter referred to the revised Guide                 Ex 76

     to     Safety    at    Sports Grounds and drew the club's attention to the new



                                           - 34 -
    guide      and      particularly           to     Chapter        2     entitled           "Management

    Responsibility".            The club were asked to confirm in writing that:



     (a)   that     they    had       obtained and intended to retain on the premises a

            copy of the guide;



     (b)    that they were familiar with the Guide and intended to perform the

           management       duties outlined in Chapter 2.                  To this end, the letter

            stated that immediate steps should be taken to                        appoint      a    Safety

            Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of the Guide and that confirmation

            of that appointment should be sent                  to   the       council    as     soon    as

            possible.



3.15 By    letter    dated          23rd October 1987, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

    replied to the letter of 21st October, 1987.                         A copy    of    their       letter

    was     received       by       the Fire Service on 26th October, 1987.                   This letter     Ex 77

    confirmed that the club did hold a copy                     of       the   Guide     to    Safety    at

     Sports    Grounds          -    1986   edition    and   the Club Secretary, Mr Mackrell

     indicated that his duties encompassed those of the Safety                            Officer       and

    that he was responsible for all matters of safety within the ground.



3.16 On    7th December, 1987, a copy of a letter dated 4th December, 1987, to

     Sheffield Wednesday Football               Club     from    Sheffield        City    Council       was
                                                                                                              Ex 78
     received      by   the Fire Service.             The letter enclosed a list of comments

    made by Officers of the Working Party at the annual inspection                                 of   the

    ground on 6th August, 1987.



     The    club     were reminded that as yet, no reply had been received to the

     letter from Sheffield City Council of 22nd April, 1987, which                                 enclosed

     the Fire Service letter of 18th February, 1987.



                                            - 35 -
3.17 A     letter     from    Sheffield           City    Council dated 8th February, 1988, was

    received.        The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                        3rd   February,
                                                                                                               Ex 79
     1988,    received        from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply                           Ex 80

    to the Fire Service             letter         of    18th   February,    1987.       David       Bownes

    expressed        concern       at    the       apparent     criticism    of    the    Fire Service

     contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                          suggested         that

     the Fire Service respond directly to them.



     The     letter     from    Eastwood           and    Partners    dealt with the Fire Service

     letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

     dealt    with     or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

     that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                               the     south

     stand     was refurbished in 1991.                  The concluding paragraph of the letter

     indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                                  the

     Fire      Service        to        the       Officer   Working    Party,     new     or    different

     recommendations were being put                      forward   which    in    some    cases      openly

     contradicted the recommendations offered by                       predecessors.



3.18 On     29th    March,      1988,         a    letter was sent to Eastwood and Partners in

     reply to their          criticism of the Fire Service.                                                    Ex 81




3.19 By letter dated 29th March, 1988, the police informed the Fire                                  Service

     of     the     parking     and      travelling arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

     final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                                 Ex 82




3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                  of

     the     ground     and made a note of their findings.                   They toured the ground
                                                                                                               Ex 83
     and checked all final exits, finding stewards and police                             in    position.

     Emergency          lighting          and        firefighting      equipment         all      appeared

     satisfactory.           The PA system was also audible                throughout      the       ground.



                                              - 36 -
    However,         it    was       noted    that    a   number    of    stewards    were    without

     identification and no log book was kept.



3.21 On 19th May, 1988, a further inspection was carried out at                         the     ground

    by      the    Fire    Service and the observations of the officer who attended                         Ex 84

    were set out in a letter dated 25th May, 1988 which                         was   sent    to     the

     local authority.



3.22 On     9th August, 1988, ADO Howlands attended the meeting (referred to at

     Tab.15 of Volume 1 of the South Yorkshire Police documents)                            which    was

     called        by     the    police      to   discuss   the     operational       attendance      at

     Hillsborough Football Ground during the                     coming     season.   ADO     Howlands

     stressed       that        it   was     essential    that     the    Fire Service received an

     accurate indication of the exact location of an incident                          and    what    it

     was.



3.23 By     letter dated 30th March, 1989, the police informed the Fire Service

     of the parking and travelling arrangements made for                        the    FA    Cup     semi   Ex 85

        final on 15th April, 1989.



3.24 On     3rd April, 1989, a letter dated 30th march, 1989, was received from

        Sheffield City Council enclosing a draft                   copy    of   the   final    revised      Ex 86

        Safety Certificate Conditions which as far as possible incorporated the

     comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                        Sheffield    City    Council

     dated        13th    August,      1987.      The letter listed four points for further

     consideration.

          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions

          I refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:R G /E B ) in
          connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

          I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
          Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
          letter. You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
          had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
          achieved.

          There are four points which require some further consideratlon:-

                  (a)      You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                           connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                           Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                           No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
                           consider it further;

                  (b)      police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                           adequately covered in Condition 7;

                  (c)      identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                           the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                           further comments on it;

                  (d)      the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                           justification for this Condition would be.

          Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions in due course.

          Yours faithfully,

                    GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS


INTRODUCTION

This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in 'order to inform
Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates'takes advice from
the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of health and Consumer
Services and the Council's Building Surveyor. These Officers and the Council
itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
specified activities are reasonably safe.                 .

GUIDANCE                                                      .

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accjrdance with the time constraints given in the
advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
relation to "public order” situations the correct handling of which should
reduce any risk to spectator safety.

The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
and the risk to spectators minimised.

The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
planning can take place.

In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
Stadium.

                     GUIDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS


INTRODUCTION

This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council in order to inform
Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
Conditions. The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates takes advice from
the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of Health and Consumer
Services and the Council’s Building Surveyor. These Officers and the Council
itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
specified activities are reasonably safe.

GUIDANCE

Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
should be acted upon in accordance with the time constraints given in the
advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
reduce any risk to spectator safety.

The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative
purposes. These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
and the risk to spectators minimised.

The Chief Constable must also be informed    the earliest possible moment of the
proposed date and content of all specified activities so that appropriate
planning can take place.

In addition there must be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
take place if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
may require, for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
is "all ticket” or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
Stadium.

Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 30th March in connection with the above,        please
find below the observations of this Department.

The final revised Safety Certificate Conditions have been examined and the
four points referred to in your letter have been reconsidered.

With regard to the four points referred to

(a)   It is agreed that the wording of Condition 11 should be satisfactory
      without stipulating an age range but the experience in Barnsley, where
      they have some difficulty recruiting suitable stewards was that fifteen
      year old boys were being appointed and it was felt that at that age they
      may not be able to cope with an emergency situation.

(b)   On the Police knowledge of the whereabouts of a      doctor,   there   are   no
      further observations.

(c)   Should any match be such that large numbers of the press, TV or radio be
       attracted, it would help the Police and club officials if all personnel
       belonging to these organisations were identifiable, particularly where
       they have access to areas beneath stands whilst a match is in progress.

(d)   The attendance of a competent electrician is required within the period
       prior to 3 hours before the commencement of any game in order to test
       the general and emergency lighting and fire warning systems. Should an
       electrical fault occur whilst a match is in progress, it is felt that
       this should be investigated and rectified immediately in order that the
       match can continue with complete crowd safety. This was a condition of
       the County Council Certificate.
Other matters noted are

(a)   In the "Interpretation of the General Safety Certificate" the Definition
      of the Certificatehas been modified. In the previous draft reference
      was made to what the Certificate was comprisedof, this has now been ^        (t)
      omitted.   Should the fact that the Certificate comprises the general        va
      conditions, schedules, plans and 'Guidance for Safety Certificate
      Holders', be recorded at this stage?                                     ^     •

(b)   In Schedule 4,_ the requirement to test emergency lighting and fire
       warning/ pub 1icaddr ess systems "not more” than three hours prior to a 5
       specified     activity    taking   place   should read "not less" than
       three hours prior to a specified activity taking place as in the
       original South Yorkshire County Council conditions. The reason for this
       is to allow the batteries for such systems to become recharged prior to
       the event commencing.       You have extended this requirement to all
       lighting systems (excluding the emergency lighting) and all doors, gates
       and turnstiles etc., specifying the three hour time limit in each        QStfc
       instance. The three hour time limit is only critical in respect of
       emergency lighting and fire warning public address systems for the ^
       reason specified above, therefore, as regards normal lighting and doors „ **0,0
       etc., subject to them being tested on the day of the event, no specific
       time limit is considered tobe necessary.       It could certainly     be   “j " -
       considered to be onerous to require all such tests within three hours of ^
       an event commencing.

(c)   Following my previous comments, Condition 12(a) has been modified to the
      effect that stewards must prevent overcrowding under the direction of
      the Safety Officer or the Chief Steward or an Authorised Officer.
      Whilst this may be satisfactory when considering migration from one
      section to another once spectators are within the ground, it is felt
      that this matter can be more reliably controlled by strictly limiting
      the numbers admitted to each section at the turnstiles. As each section
      is filled, the turnstiles, which are capable of recording this fact
      should be locked. This may not be considered to be a relevant condition
      for   inclusion   in   the   Certificate but certainly needs further
      consideration before any Certificate is issued or amended.

(d)   There is no Schedule 3 setting out the capacities of each section of the
      ground attached to the draft conditions. It is recognised, however,
      that these need further consideration by the Officer Working Party
      before finalisation since figures will be needed for each part of a
      ground from the Police, Building Control and Fire Service to determine
      the actual limits.

(e)    Schedules 1 and 2 detailing numbers of stewards to be on duty at a
      specified activity and the duties to be carried out will need detailed
      consideration and again it is felt that these are matters for discussion
      with the Officer Working Party for final resolution by yourselves.

It is now hoped that you will beable to finalise the adoption of the General
Safety Certificate conditions as quickly as possible in order that the
outstanding amendment to the Certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday FC and
the issue of the Certificate to Sheffield United FC can then be progressed.

This will entail a full evaluation of all aspects by the Officer Working
Party, i.e. ground capacities, stewarding arrangements, firefighting and
emergency evacuation procedures etc. This will require the provision of up to
date plans of all buildings, stands, terraces, etc.
The County Fire Service are willing to give every assistance to   achieve   this
aim.

If you have any further queries on these matters, please do not hesitate to
contact the Officer concerned.

Yours faithfully,




Chief Fire Officer.

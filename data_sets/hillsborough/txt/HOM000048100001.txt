    Dear Lord Stuart-Smith,


                                                         Hillsborough


                    Thank you for your letter.

          I doubt whether The Football Association knows directly
    of any "new" evidence which would assist your scrutiny, but I
    will consult my colleagues and check once again to ascertain
    whether there is anything we should put before you.

          We are, of course, entirely at your disposal if we can
    help in any way.

Dear Mr Owston,

RE: DAVID DUCKENFIELD: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 10 July 1998.

I note the present position in this matter and await further developments.


Yours Sincerely



G.R.CROSTON
Prosecution Team Leader
From:               George Croston
To:                 CPSHQL.DPP.DIRECTOR, CPSHQL.CCU.SHARPLID
Date:               13 July 1998 11:02am
Subject:            Hillsborough: Withdrawal of summonses

The solicitors for the Hillsborough Family Support Group have now accepted that the informations that they laid
at South Sefton Magistrates' Court were defective for want of jurisdiction to issue process. Section 1(2) of the
Magistrates' Courts Act does not apply as the alleged offences were committed outside the court's commission
area and the proposed defendants do not live within the area .

The solicitors for Mr Duckenfield have had extensive correspondence with the HFSG on the above point and at
one stage had threatened judicial review proceedings.

It is expected that fresh informations will be laid within the South Yorkshire commission area in the near future.

George Croston

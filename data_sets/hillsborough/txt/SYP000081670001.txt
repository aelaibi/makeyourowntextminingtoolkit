and above           named,    in\£>rder to take           refreshments.

Just after kick-off w h i l s t                 crossing P e n is to ne Rd towards            the gro und
                                    \     N i n a
we were stopped by a S u v ^ r i n t e n d e n t             (believed Su p e r i n t e n d e n t C H A P M A N ) ,

who was h a v n w           problems     identifying        the    content       of radio transmission.

Th en dire ct ed           iVto ground,         to what was be li eve d to be a public

disorder           situation.

Ar r i v e d    into ground at          ’S p i o n K o p ’ end.    There was        obvious     dis ru pt io n

at the Live rp oo l           s up po rt er s    end -    ’W S t a n d ’ . On nearing        the stand,         I

noti ce d an Off ic er a p p a r e n t l y st rug gli ng wit h a middle age d gent.

Be l i e v i n g    that the Off ic er was att em pt in g              to effect an arrest,               I went

to as si st         him.    I took hold of the m a n ’s right arm and the other

Off i c e r     (not known to me)           told me that          "It was alright,           h e ’d just     had

a rough timfev. coming out of there"                      (referring         to the m i d d l e - a g e d man

We a p p r o a c h e d the W S t a n d \ I        saw O f f i c er s   climbing onto the fence,                 but

I could not make out what                   t h e V were doing.         I was      instru cte d by a

Se r ge an t       (not known to me)            to fons^i     cordon acr oss         the pitch.       I saw a

L iv er pool supp or te r         run the full           length of the          pitch and stand           in the

goal m ou th to the             'Spion Hop*        end,    mak ing     ’V*    sign gesture to the

Notts.         Forest      supporters.      Myself and PC DEXTER and other Of fi cer s

fo rmed a passive             cordon across          the pitch.        At this time        I had not seen

any bodies,           or other      persons other          than    ’walk ing wounded'.

It was only w he n st re t c h e r s             passed me,       carrying       corpses,     that    I

realised the seve ri ty of the situation.

On   realising          this,    and after        having su ff er ed         consider abl e     verbal

abuse      from di st r e s s e d a n d     intoxic ate d Liverp ool             supporters.       I decided
                                                                                                             PAGE      3

            time.     Myself a n d PC DEXTER mo ved forward towards                      the W St an d to assist

            the     injured.                         X

                  a s s i s t e d a man    lying on t m ^ y i o o r ,    having    s p a s m s . We stayed with

(3r/\\/£.   him anci then lifted the man onto a stretc her w h er eb y he was                            carried

            away.

            By the time we           reached the         perimeter      fence,    people were fi lte rin g      out

            of the gates.          Our     co ncern was to the N or th side of the West Stand.

            I did not see any              corpses    carried from that side of the stand.

            I a t t e m p t e d to clear the ground           in order      to give acc ess        to the

            Am b u l a n c e Service,       who had not a r ri ve d until          that time.

            Ma ny    fans were eager           to help but were not sure what                  to do.   Many were

            w a n de ri n g a i m l e s s l y and others were        looking      for   lost    relatives and

            friends.

            A   large     number     of the w o o d e n ad v er ti si ng    boards had been collected by

            the fans and they were str ew ed ar ou nd the goal m ou th area.

            I dir ec t e d a number          of the fans to        clear them out of the way,               to place

            them near the goals,              and then to stand to one side to await a call for

            as si s t a n c e   from us,     sh ou ld we need it, at the same time,                 thanking    them

            for their help,           a l r e a d y given.

            Am bu l a n c e s   st arted to arrive.

            I can remember a fight starting                   in the      corner of the S/W stands,

            apparently          between me mb e r s      of the Liver poo l       supporters.      I ran towards

            this,     but before          1 a r r i v e d the s i t ua ti on had been contro lle d by other

            Of fi ce rs \p re se nt u
                                                                 a /32>£7
            I was      instructed by Chief S u p e r i n t e ndent NE SB IT to form a cordon on

            the     cent re 1 i'ntek*. in order       to   clear the      pitch an d     restore order.

            At no time,          did I have       contact wi th      corpses.

            Ev en at the time of being a sk ed by Chief Su p e r i n t e n d e n t NE SB IT to form

            a cordon,           I had no    idea of the extent of the              injuries/f ata lit ies ,     or
                                                                                                         PAGE          4

           the    reasons behind them.           I had seen about         six corpses being           carried,     I

           had not seen many badly              injured    persons,      the ones       I had seen ap pe a r e d

           to be d i s t re s s e d   rather    than physically       injured.      1 felt     ill-informed,

           unable       to get    involved because of the mass             of    people     present,    and   in

           the early stages           ge n u i n e l y fri gh te ne d as the    potential     for a full

           scale       riot was    clearly evidtesqt,

           After       it was a n n o u n c e d that t h e Ngame had been        called off,     and having

           cleared most of the            pitch,     we returned to Ra w s o n Spring Rd a t the

           ju n ct io n wi t h Penistorts^Rd. Myself and other Offi cer s a s s i s t e d                in

           clearing traffic.

           Eve n at this stage a fight broke out bet wee n                      rival    suppor ter s and PS

           TA YL O R    calmed the s i t u a t i o n as   I ran to ass ist        him    (in company wi t h DC

           HUBBARD)       the van full       of bel ie ve d Liver poo l        supporters,     were    reluctant

           to move       on.   Yet a g a i n under    normal   circumstances,           arr est s w ou ld have

           been made except           for the    i mpr act ica lit ies    of the situation.           We went

           off duty at         1930 hours.

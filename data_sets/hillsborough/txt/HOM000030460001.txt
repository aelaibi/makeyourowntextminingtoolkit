  Dear Sir

  Hillsborough Disaster Documentation

  I refer to your letter of 3 August in which you state you are awaiting legal advice as to
  whether you are able to release documents requested by HFSG. I would remind you that in
  his speech to the House of Commons on 18 February 1998, the Home Secretary promised to
  make this documentation available. I should be grateful to receive the outstanding items by
  return.


  Yours faithfully




  Anri Adlington
  Solcitor

        Dear Ms Adlington

        Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

       I refer to your recent requests of statements and information, some made direct to South
       Yorkshire Police and some made to Mr M PYNE, Home Office Policing Policy Unit.

       You began private prosecutions on 26 June 1998 for alleged offences concerned with the
       disaster. The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing the case. I am awaiting legal
       advice on whether I should release information.

        I will write to you again as soon as practicable.

        Yours sincerely




        fan Daines
        Assistant Chief Constable

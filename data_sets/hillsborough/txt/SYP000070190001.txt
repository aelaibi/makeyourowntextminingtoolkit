                 urther     to my previous           sta t e m e n t    dated 22ncM?fiay 1989              (220589),        on   19th

              Jul y     1989     (190789)        I was   shown a v i d e \ ^ a p e            reference       number     (MAP-7 )y

               exhibit      number        (        ) by PS K I L L O C H of the West M i d l a n d s Police*



              At tape       reference         number     1 5 . 2 0 .46.05 to       15.22.04 -           (Data Base)         I can

               identify myself             on the    video,       located       in the         centre     of the/ficture.



              At this       point        I was   e n g a g e d w ith a deceased.                The    body      is shown

              wear i n g    dark    trousers,        white       top.      I am shown            in a N o t t i n g h a m Police

              U n i f o r m Jacket,        which    is ye l l o w      in colour,         giving m o u t h to m o u t h

              The      body was     passed       to me out of Pen 3 Valong a line of officers.                                    I
                                                       y                                                          PAG E

have     signed a sketch             plJ»j/to indicate                 the    position on the           pitch       (ref.

BDW/ 1 ) (e x h .          ).



On the same video             tape           (M A P /'5^/eChibit        (       > , at time         reference

•15.52.05           - to15.22. 12,       can be seen the body                    of    a youth w e a r i n g a red

candy top,           blue jeans an d white                 pumps or training             shoes.        The     body    is

in the        centre    of the      picture and a u n i f o r m e d Police Officer                          can be

seen wit h the          body,     this         o f f i c e r ’s i d e ntity     is unknown          to rne.



I am almost           positive      that        this youth          is the      same y outh that            earlier        I

had    carried out of Pen 2 and                        placed on the           pitch.        The    body had been

handed to me at the               gate         by an unkn o w n Pol i c e Officer.                   I am fairly

certain        it was    pen 2,        I remember             the   pen was      fairly empty,           however,

it could have           been gate 3.



When     I placed the         body on the                  pitch,   the y o u t h was alive,            I had found

a pulse and he was              breathing.                  I had a sked a football                fan to    look

a fter    him whilst        I went           back      to assist        other    people       out of     the

terraces.           The boy     in q u e s t i o n was about                 14 years    old.



  have        indicated,      on a ske t c h               plJwf of the       pitch,    the a p p r o x i m a t e

location        I placed      the b o dy,              I have si g n e d       the    plan    (ref B D W / 2 )

(exh,          ).



On the same tape            (M A P / A / i     (exh.            ) at    time    reference          15.27.59.01        to

almost        off    picture)     giving         first aid          to a person whose               i d e ntity     I do

not    know     (B D W / 3 ) (exh.                ).



Also     on    (MAP/70y(exh.                  ) at     tape    reference        15.28. 5 4 . 2 0 to      15.28. 5 6 . 0 2

I can be seen in the             top    centre of the                 picture      engaged w ith the body

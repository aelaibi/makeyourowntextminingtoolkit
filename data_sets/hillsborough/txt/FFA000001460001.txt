    TO ALL CLUBS

t
    Dear Secretary,

                           Crowd Safety and Crowd Control

         The President and I, along with Mr. Killichip and Mr. Croker of the
    Football Association, attended a further meeting at Downing Street yesterday,
    both as a follow-up to the Initial meeting held on 1st April and in consequence
    of the Bradford City and Brussels incidents last month.

         I will keep this report relatively brief and confine it to the domestic
    aspect.

         The Government confirmed that they had given appropriate direction to
    the police and courts about the need to lay serious charges and hand down
    firm sentences. The police will gather better information and intelligence.

         The recent White Paper on the Review of Public Order Law proposes that
    the police be given statutory powers to restrict attendances at matches
    and to Impose conditions, e.g. presumably all-ticket. This legislation will
t   be proposed in the next session of Parliament, i.e. after the start of season
    1985 / 86 .

         In the current session of Parliament, i.e. before the start of the
    next season, the Government proposes to take powers similar to those appertaining
                                                                                      »«**
    in Scotland in respect of alcohol. The Government will adopt a flexible
    approach towards the implementation of these powers and whilst, in the first
    instance, alcohol will he prohibited on grounds and certainly on terraces,
    it will be open to magistrates subsequently to grant exemptions to cluba.
    There will be further representations in order to protect the interests
    of cluba, supporters and sponsors.

         following yesterday’s meeting, th«re is an onus upon the football bodies
    to consider certain matters as a matter of u r g e n c y ( i ) the imposition
    of all-ticket matches in respect of certain matches/certain clubs and (il)
    the implementation by certain clubs of controls on access, i.e. membership
    card scheme.

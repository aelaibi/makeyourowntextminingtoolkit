              Dear Sir

              Re:    Hillsborough Inquest
                     Judicial Review Application

              We represent the next of kin of six of those who died at the
              Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April 1989.

              You may be aware that our clients have applied to the High Court
              for a Judicial Review of the Inquest conducted by the Coroner for
              South Yorkshire. This Application has been adjourned pending a
              decision to be made by the Attorney General as to whether to grant
              leave under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988. It was however
              directed that we notify you of the contents of the Application
              in the event that you may wish to make representations to the Court
              when the Application for leave is renewed.

              Accordingly we enclose at this stage a copy of the Form 86A which
              sets out the Grounds upon which relief is sought. We further enclose
              a copy of the Memorial to the Attorney General which is the prime
              exhibit in the Judicial Review Application. (We have not enclosed
              copies of the new evidence to save copying costs at this stage).
              We trust you will regard this as sufficient information and we
              will notify you when the Application is eventually relisted.
              Yours faithfully
                         Castle Esplanade
                         Chester CHI 2PP

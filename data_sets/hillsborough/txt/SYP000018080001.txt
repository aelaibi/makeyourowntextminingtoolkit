                      Dear Dr. Eastwood

                       I have been made aware that you have recently carried out tests
                       on gate *C* of the Leppings Lane West stand of Sheffield
                       Wednesdays Football Club ground.  I write to gunfirm that an
                       exclusion zone has been disignated by Lord Justice Taylor- viz
                       the West stand and access may only be gained with written
                       authority.  1 must point out that anyone acting in contravention
                       of Lord Justice Taylors directions may be considered in contempt
                       of his directions.

                       In view of the fact that you have gained access and carried out
                       certain tests it is necesssary to make arrangements to interview
                       you and those who assisted with the tests on Monday ?? May to
                       record how those tests were conducted and what results were
                       attained.

              Dear Mr Mackrell

              Can I confirm that the area of your ground previously notified by
              Lord Justice Taylor as being excluded, viz the West Stand still
              exists, and it must be considered that any person ignoring that
              exclusion order without written apporoval under my signature as
              Assistant Chief Constable could be considered in comtempt of Lord
              Justice Taylors directions.

              I would be most grateful in these circumstances if you could ensure
              that no further contravention of Lord Justice Taylors directions
              are alJowed to take place.

              I am 'faxing' to you copy letters I am sending to Eastwoods and
              Partners and Councillor Harry Chase of Liverpool City Council
              which are self explanatory.

             Councillor Harry Chase
             Secretary,
             Liverpool City Council




              Dear Councillor Chase

              Following our conversation of 18 May respecting permission sought
              by you to attend the West stand of Sheffield Wednesday Football
              Club,  I wm yet to receive a 'faxed' letter from you in order that
              I can give written authority as I explained.

              1 have learned today from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club that
              you have visited the ground and in particular the West stand
              without my written authority.

             Can I remind you that access has been restricted by order of Lord
             Justice Taylor and any contravention of those directions may be
             considered a contempt.

             In view of the fact that you have taken this action into your own
             hands without my written authority it is necessary to interview
             those who attended without that permission to discuss the purpose
             of the visit and the events that took place during the visit,

             I shall be appointing a senior officer from my Liverpool office to
             contact you on Monday 22 May,

             I trust in FuturS that you will coipply with Lord Justice Taylors
             directions on this matter.

                 exists, and it must be considered that any person ignoring that
                 exclusion order without written apporoval under my signature as

                 Justi.cc Taylors directions.

                  I would be most grateful in these circumstances if you could ensure
                  that no further contravention of Lord Justice Taylors directions
                  are allowed to take place.

                  I am 'faxing' to you copy letters I am sending to Eastwoods and

            Councillor Harry Chase
            Secretary,
            Liverpool City Council




            Dear Councillor Chase

            Following our conversation of 18 Hay respecting permission sought
            by you to attend the West stand of Sheffield Wednesday Football
            Club, I am yet to receive a 'faxed' letter from you in order that
            I can give written authority as I explained.

            1 have learned today from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club that
            you have visited the ground and in particular the West stand
            without my written authority.

            Can I remind you that access has been restricted by order of Lord
            Justice Taylor and any contravention of those directions may be
            considered a contempt.

            In view of the fact that you have taken this action into your own
            hands without ray written authority it is necessary to interview
            those who attended without that permission to discuss the purpose
            of the visit and the events that took place during the visit.

            I shall be appointing a senior officer          from my Liverpool         officeto
       (    contact you on Monday 22 May,

            I trust in future that you will coipply         with Lord Justice      Taylors
            directions on this matter.

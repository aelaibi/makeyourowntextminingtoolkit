            At    about        20    past    10 am we          all    got    a taxi       from     the W i l l i a m s o n    Square

            taxi       r ank    to P r i o r y     R o a d,    Liverpool       4 getting           there      about     20    to    11 am.

We w a i t e d     there       until       5    past    11 a m w h e n            we       boarded a white                   Barnes

Travel       Coach,       I think          number       26,       which        I had            already          bought          a ticket

for.        It w a s     advertised             in    the    Liverpool                Echo       pape r.          BARNES TRAVEL

regularly          do    the    coaches          to    the       away matches.

When    I boarded             the    coach       I was       carrying             a       bag    with       food and             cans    of

pop and       there       were       2 Policemen             on    the       coach          and       they were             checking

everyone         for     drink       and weapons.                 He    checked my                   bag    and       let    me    board

the    coach without                any    problems.

I didn't         see     anyone       have       anything          taken          off       them       but       he    checked

anyone       carrying          anything.

W E all      got    on    the       coach and          set       off    at    a       1/4       to    12 noon,           with a

full    coach.

We    drove      towards        the       Match       and    got       stuck          in a t r a f f i c          jam

on    the    Motorway,          the       M62    by M a n c h e s t e r .             This       was       because there               were        a

lot    of    people       going       to       the    various          matches             that       were       on t h a t       day    and a

lot    of    people       needed          to use       that       stretch             of M o t o r w a y . A s         we    approached

the    ground       in S h e f f i e l d        at    about       10    past          2    pm    I saw       a    lot       of

supporters,             mainly Liverpool,                   walking          towards             the       ground.           I saw       som#r

drinking         outside        the       White       Horse       Pub which                is t o w a r d s       the L i v e r p o o l           «rn

of    the    ground.About             5 minutes             lat e r     the       coach          eventually              parked         past

Wadsley       Bridge          Railway          Station       about       1/2 a m i l e                to a m i l e          from the*>

ground.          I don't        know       the       name    of    the       r o ad s       but       there       was       a lot       of

coaches        parked         there.The          four       of    us    left          the       coach       and       we w a l k e d

towards       the       ground.           We    stopped          off    at    a       Pizza Parlour                   just       beforethe

White       Horse       Pub    and    had. a P i z z a .           We    left             there       at    about        2 5 or 2 0          to    3

pm.We       walked       past       the    White       Horse       Pub       and          I saw       about        10 or 15 p e o p l e

drinking         alcohol        outside,             supporters          that             is,    but       there       wasn't          very

many    because          it w a s     late       and    everyone             wa s         trying       to    get       to    the       ground.

There       were    Police          along       the    roa d      keeping             an    eye       out    fo r      trouble          but

we    wern't        stopped          by a n y        of     them*

I got       to     th e L e p p i n g s        Lane       entrance           at       about       20       to 3      pm a n d        it w as

congested.               There       were       thousands              of    people             waiting         to     get      into       the

turnstiles              a n d as     I worked myself                    forwards                I was       shocked and

surprised           to     see     that        the       gates     leading             to       the    turnstiles              were        closed

and    locked.             The     gates        were        locked          but       the       turnstiles             were      open       and

no    one     could        get     into        the       area     to    go       through          the       turnstiles.

I saw 4 m ou n t e d             Police         Officers           in the             cou r t     yard       between           the        gates

and    th e      turnstiles.                 They were            on t h e i r         own       be c a u s e     no    one      could        get

past       the     locked        gates.

The 4       of     us    decided          to    try        and    get       away       from        the g a t e s       because              it w a s

getting          uncomfortable                 in    the       crush and              it    d i d n ’t look            as     if the

Police        were       going       to      open        the     gates.           By       this       time      it w a s       10 to 3            pm

and    everyone           wa s     getting           anxious           to    get       in to          see    the       game.

We    started           to m a k e      our     way       back     through             the       crowd       and were            going        to

s t a n d at       the    r ea r     and wait             for    a gate           to       be    opened.

As    we    were        moving       b a ck     I saw          a group           of    about          20    lads m o v i n g          to    the

right       and     I saw        t hat       a gate         on a       line w i t h             the    gate      we     were         at    bu t    on

the    right        was     open        leading           to    the     courtyard                on    the      right        bu t     not     to

any actual              turnstiles.

We w al ke d        forwards            int o       the     couryard             and       I was       just       concentrating                   on

getting          in to      see      the m a t c h .

I just        followed           t he     other          fans     a nd we w e n t               across       the       courtyard            and

to a g a t e        which        had      been       opened,           I'm not             sure       who    by,       that      lead

directly           into     the      ground.

I was       in the         first        50     to    go     through,             I didn't             see    any       signs         telling           us

where       to     go,    but      the       fans        in f r o n t       of    us w e r e          Liverpool             f an s    and    my

friends          ha d    been      before           so     I just       folowed             them       diagonally               left        to the

tunnel        to    pens 3 a n d 4.                  I     went     that         way       b e c a u s e it w a s       the      only       way
                                                                                                                                       PAGE


I could          see       to get          to       the    pens-           There       M/ere no      sig n s ,       or    stewards          or

no th i n g .

I went        into         the       tunnel          an d we         had    no    problem       going          through          to    the

pens.         Everyone,               at       the    time       I went          through,       went          through        the      tunnel

normally           and      at       the       end    I went          to    the    right       of    the       fence       i nt o     p e n 3.

The       pen w a s        virtually                full     and      everyone          wanted       to       see    the m a t c h      so w e

worked        our         way    through             towards          the     front      until       I was          about       15 f e e t

from       the     front         and about                1/ 2 w a y a c r o s s        the    pen.

It w a s      about         5 to 3             pm    by t h i s       tim e      and    between          that       time     and 5      p as t

3    pm    I could          feel       t hat         more       and    more       people       were       pushing          in a n d we

were       being          pushed       forwards              and      to    the    left       and    getting             crushed

against          the       people          in f r o n t         of    us.        I ducked under                a barrier             because

I didn't           want         to    get       crushed          against          it.

At    about       3       pm the m a t c h            kicked          off a n d        by t his      time        it was         getting

really        uncomfortable                     in the          pen.

At    5    past       3    pm P e t e r         BEARDSLEY             nearly       scorred          a goal          at    th e K o p    end

and       everyone          just       surged             forwards.              I got    all       of    the       breath       squashed

out       f me     and      I blacked                out.

I am       certain          that       if       he        had   scored, I          w o u l d be d e ad,             I'm l u c k y     he     hit

the       crossbar.

When       I c a me        around          I    was        lying       on     the f l o o r of th e            court       y a r d b y th e

turnstiles                X PK       near       to w h e r e          I was w a i t i n g      to get          in e a r l i e r       and

                   and      a guy          called                       from K i rb y were               looking          after       me.

I remember                seeing       a Policeman                   and a doctor             coming          to me       but     I couldn*

t talk        or      move       my    body.

It w a s      about         20 m i n u te s           after          I ha d      come    around          that       I was       carried

outside          to a n a m b u l a n c e             and       taken       to    the N o r t h e r n         General        Hospital.

I want        to      add       that       when       I crossed             the    courtyard             on    the w a y        in    I was

looking          for       someone             to    give my          ticket       to    but    we       all     went      through          i nto
                                                                                                                                PAGE     5


the     ground without                  anyone          checking           our    tickets.         In    fact       no    one

checked        my      ticket        that         day.

As     I was       crushed         I was          with                           , we'd    got     separated             from    the

others.

I want        to     add    that        at    3    pm     people       were       getting        crushed       at      the    front

and     people        were        trying          to    climb        over    the    front        fence      but     the P o l i c e

were        telling        them      to      get       back.         I don't       think     t h at     they      saw     people

were        getting        injured and                 only     saw    people       climbing          the    fe nc e .        I suppose

that        they    thought          that         they were           just       trying     to get       o n t o the         pitch.

Th e    last       thing      I remember                before        passing        out is a P o l i c e O f f i c e r

opening        the       g a te    at     the      front        of    pen 3 onto          the     pitch.          At     this    point

the     game       M,'as s t i l l      going          on e v e n     though       people        were    being         injured and

the P o l i c e       had    opened           the       gate.

At     no    time     once        I ha d      reached           the    ground        d i d Isee a n y o n e         consuming

alcohol.

I didn't           see     any     fights          or     disorder          between       th e    fans.        There

was     a good atmosphere                     between           everyone.

I didn't           see     anyone         collapse             or    receive       any    particular           injuries.           I

didn't        see     any    barriers              collapse.




I want        to a d d      that        my    injuries              were    torn    ligaments           left      ankle,

concussion,              cuts      to m y         face     &    neck,       and    nose,     bruising          to m y a r m s,

neck,        back,       ches t      and      legs

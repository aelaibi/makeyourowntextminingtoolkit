              lived in B r j j d l f o r d , we left Bradford by p^i'vate motor car at about 12.
'M a K & f a .            ^
 {^fcuu^ay g o p r n (1230) arriving in Sheffield atySbout 1.30pm ( 1330? . We did not

                  experience any traffic hold ups                route.      We parked the car J / n a side

          q   -   street somewhere near to Leppings Ln,                I believe l^awks\ey / v e n u e , it

  ^               was fairly easy to park.            There were no policemen th a p S l       saw directing

                  traffic.      We walked down to the football ground via Leppings Lane,                        on
                                                                               PAGE           2

 route whilst in L e ppin#s Lane I saw two young men chinking from cans

 of Carlsberg Special Brew,     I do not know if thgey were football

 supporters or not as neither wore any             ;ours.   We arrived ^aft the
                                    SGE_
 entrance to the ground at about     1.42pm (1345).          There w^re not many

 people about,    those that were, yere milling around rather                  queuing

 outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles,      there were two polifremen on
                                          fb\ b / s
 horses,    and one uniformed offija4r to every turnstiles     to G) . My

 husband was searched by a y 5 \ ice officer srior to entering and once

 through the turnstile     I myself was searchedXby a police officer
                                    ls 4 k
 There was a policeman to every turnstile inside the ground,             I then

went with my husband down the tu^fnel into Pei                At the time I

 thought    it odd that there were no        l c.era         fe tunnel entrance,         as

at the equivalent Semi-Final      last year     in "r       there were a number of

 policemen directing fans to pens si;< and/>even one and two.             We

 entered the ground at about the same timle on the previous y e a r s .

Having been to this ground a number of times I don't look for signs

 indicating where terraces are as I know where to go.



 having entered pen 4/my husband and I stood towards the rear of the

 terrace nearer tcy'pen 5.     We stood there for about five minutes,             and

 decided we cou/d get a better view point of the game in J fh e          terrace to

 our left, we w ent to the rear/ff      pen 4 to the transfer gate leading to

 pens 5 6 and 7,      The gates/were open,    there were r/o policemen or

i stewards at these    point^s, we merely walked through and viewed the game

 from a position as i/fdi cated in pe^f 7 on map (E:< No             )

                              ''S c) ■+"
 At about 2.30pm     (Ij^SO) I noticed a large build up            ans in pens 3

 and 4,     it was otyious to me that these fans ne          ^5 moving to the

 terracing on e/ther side as there was more th<^             ?nough room in Pens 6
                                                                                  PAGE        3

and Pens 7.       I do not think the fans saw the transfer gates at the

rear of Pen 4 as I saw fans climbing over the fences into Pens 5 and

ft. F roiTi rny re-collection of the game,         the match started and shortly

afterwards,     about two minutes afterwards,           just before Peter^^Seardsley

hit the crossbar       I noticed a large number of fans c 1 imjw ng1 over the

fence in Pens 3 and 4 onto the pitjuff,             I could see    hat the crowd in

these pens were crushed,             of th^r people that climbed over the fence I

could see that some were             iagured.   They appeared to have chest

injuries as they were holding their arms across themselves and

appeared to be gaspijrtg for breath,            I d i d n ’t see the police pushing

anybody back into these pens,              but neither did I see any po lj/cemen

helping fans,      there were also a large number of peo pi ey!?l imbi ng up

 •om the rear of pens three and four i ^ o ^ t h e West S ^ and,            It appeared
 —          —-
,o me as if j*ffe Police were not a^sre of what was happening                  inside
                                 ,     O' NlllO.        ,
pens 3 an*f 4, shortly afterwarefs a ^policeman ran onjA) the pitch a nd

stopp^g the game, at first I thought the pol i ce^Tere going to get the

excess fans out of pens three and four and bring them into pen 6 where

there was plenty of room, bu^'from this time on I saw peo pljj/pei ng
                                                    (b\  J & L r r \ -fe n c e . .
carried over the fencing/pnto the pitch, I saw policemen/on the pitch

pushing at the fenciag as if trying to kick the fencing down and fans

on the inside trying to pull the fencing out,               it^tfSas a while

afterwards before          I        the fireman come down the tunnel     into Pen 3

and 4 initially t h 4 y helped tear down th#r fencing and a f t e r w a r d / were

tending to i n ju f^ e d       persons.   There wa^e a number of St Jo^n/4^mbulance_

brigade     peoj/le about, who seemed to get to the injured Persons quickly,



Of our yrfwn accored my husband and I left Xjrfe ground at about 4 . 0 5 pm

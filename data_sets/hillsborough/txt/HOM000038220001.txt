This section deals with two video tapes from the camera overlooking the
terracing of the Leppings Lane end on the day of the disaster.


Schedules of both tapes were prepared for Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry by
West Midlands police officers.


The tapes are identified by the prefixes TB1 and TB2. TB are the initials of
the police officer (Police Constable Trevor Bichard) who was responsible for
operating the CCTV cameras and recording equipment on that day.


TB1 runs from 11.59.51 to 15.04.08 and video TB2 runs from 11.59.52 to
15.34.50.

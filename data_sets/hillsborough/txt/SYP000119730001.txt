As    time             progressed,                Liverpool             f an s     s t il l     continued           to    try a nd         get

stewards,                   or     gatemen.             Almost          all      were re-directed                   as    previously

described,                        A very         selective          few were              allowed        through          the       sterile

area,          the          very       old       or    young       and     the      in firm,           and    then       in    each       case

they were                   escorted             from       barrier        to      barrier         through          the       sterile

section.                    So     far      as    my    own     serial           were      concerned,              there       was     very

little             required              in the         form       of    direct           supervision.                They were            at       the

tickets                ready.            Very         few    problems            were      presented.               The       officers          on

serial             6       had     slightly            more     of a       problem,             in that        it fell          to     them         to

maintain                   th e    sterile            area and          re-direct              f ans    bound       for L e p p i n g s

Lane,              I gave            them what assistance                          I could,            particularly             in f i l t e r i n g

the       fans             who     were      allowed          past       the       barrier         for       gate     ’E ’ .        With

Liverpool                   fans       s t ill        trying       to    get       through         the       car    park,       I liaised

with Sergeant                        Jacques           and    ensured            t ha t    his     serial          were       aware       that       the

official                   car     park w a s          not    to    be     treat          as    a thoroughfare.

(So       far          as     this a s p e c t          of    the m a t t e r         is       concerned,           my    opinion          is that

many          of       the L i v e r p o o l           fans     I spoke            wit h were           well       aware       of    the    layo u t

of    the H i l l s b o r o u g h                 stadium,          probably              from     previous           visits         to    the

ground,                and        that m a t c h        tickets          showed a              plan     of    the     ground,          clearly

indicating                    the      probability              of a       route          via    the     car       park).

By about                   2.30      p.m.        my    ser i a l    was       at     its       busiest,        with a          constant

stream             of       fans       seeking          admission.                 Queueing            was minimal.                 I doubt          if

anyone             queued            for     longer          than a minute,                    with     the    queues          only       reaching

about          8 to           10     persons           at t h e i r       longest.                                                                        ,

Also          about           this       time         I recollect             looking           through        the       'E*    gate            ■

There       was       almost       constant          traffic         on       the       radio at              t hi s     t im e    and       the

Up    to    t his      stage       radio       transmissions                  had       been        satisfactory?                  but       from

this       was    due       to    increased          crowd       noise         or a t e c h n i c a l               problem,            I am

unaware,          but       control       transmissions                  at    times           were       distorted,               poor and

not    easily          understood.                 The    quality         of       the       radio            was      so    poor       at    one

aware       whether          or    not    the       message         was       passed           on.

Between 2.30               p.m.    and 3.00           p.m.        (possibly            earlier)          several          Mounted

Officers         made       their       way     from Pe ni st on e               R o a d Nor t h ,       through          the

sterile         a r ea,     to    the L e p p i n g s        Lane       end.         (I w o u l d      estimate           that       6 to

8 officers            used       this      route).

From     t his     time,         I r e m a i n e d at        the       barriers         at      the    end     of    the S o u t h

Stand.          There       was    s t ill      a    considerable                number         of L i v e r p o o l      f ans

trying      to     get      through        the       sterile           area,      and whilst             many       had

previously            been       re-directed              without          too    much       of a      problem,           an

increasing            number        now were a rg um e n t a t i v e                 about       having        to    seek       an

alternative            route       around           the    ground.             It was a l s o          apparent           t h#t      the

majority         of    these        l a ter a r r i v a l s ,          had     been     consuming alcohol.

I can      confirm          that      at   this       time,          I heard a          rad io        broadcast           requesting

t ha t   the m a t c h       kick       off     be    put       back.          I cannot          identify           who made          the

req u e s t ,    or    say w h e t h e r        the       t r a n s m i s s i o n was a c k n o w l e d g e d          by

con t r o l .      I do      recollect              thinking           t hat     the    request          was    late,          and    that

by that         stage       the     players          m a y well         h ave     been       r e ady     to    go    on the

pitch.          I had       no    view     of       the    pitch,          but    had      not     heard       the     l oud      cheer

that     normally           heralds        the       entry        of    the      players         o nto    the       ground.           I

also     recollect           thinking,              without          considering             the      public        order

situation          that      had      developed,             t hat      it w o u l d       be    unfair        to    delay        the

match      to a l l o w      the      latecomers             to      gain      ent r y ,     after       all,       the m a j o r i t y

had a r r i v e d      in g o o d       time        and    had       taken their             places       in the          ground.

At   that       time       I was      also aware             of      the     f act     t hat     Police        Constables

Craigie,         Fairclough and Wicken                          had     left      their         duties        in the        vicinity

I c o u l d see        that        there         were      a lr ea dy many fans               on    the    pitch.         Play          was

already         stopped and                I do     not     recollect            seeing       any    players       still           on

the      field.           I went       down        o nto    the     pitch and           climbed        o ver     the w all          onto

the      playing       area        from      the S o u t h S t a n d .             I realised          immediately             that

due      to    the    number          of    fans      on    the     pitch        that     it was       impracticable                to

arrest         t h e m all,        and      the     first        o ne s    I encountered             I tried       to u s h e r

back      to    the    terraces.                 Their      reactions            were     abnormal,           I think      t hat

from      previous          experience              of     pitch       i n v a s i o n s , I had       expected          them       to

run      off a n d a v o i d          capture.             These       youths       did      not    run off.            They

appeared            bewildered             and     confused.              They     said      people       had    been     injured

and      directed          me    towards           the     goal     mouth.          I looked         towards       the     goal

mouth.          I could          see       t hat    both P o l i c e        Officers          and    f a n s - w e re    climbing

o nt o    the       fence,       it    t oo k me         some     while      to     realise- t h a t        people were

being         lifted       over       the    top     of the         fence        into     the      playing       area.         Some

of the         officers          were       gesturing            for      people     to m o v e a w a y         from     the

fence,         in    retrospect,             I now         realise         t hat    these       gestures         were     for

p e o p l e at       the    ba ck      to m o v e        back     to      relieve       pressure.           Whilst        this          was

happening            objects          were       b e ing    thrown         from    the       terracing          towards        the

people         at    the    fe nc e .        I have         a    recollection             of one      officer           being       hit

by a n        object       t hat      disintegrated,                I assumed           it    to    be a    pie.         I found

the      whole       situation             very     incongruous             and    difficult          to    assess.            I

formed         the    opinion          t h at w h a t       I had         envisaged earlier                had    in    fact

occurred,              i.e.       there       had       been an        outbreak       of f i g h t i n g    bn    the

terraces,            which       had       resulted         in a n u m b e r       of     people      sustaining

injuries.                 The     fence       was       very crowded          b e h i n d the       goal.        I watched           the

crowd         for     a    short        time       to    try and a s sess           the s i t u a t i o n ,      and    saw        no­

penalty area and a gain                          tried      to m o v e      encroaching             spectators           ba ck      to

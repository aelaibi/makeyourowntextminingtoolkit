                At 9 . 0 0 a m     (0900)       on Saturday,        15th April,        1989    <150489)     I commenced

                 duty at H a m m e r t o n R oa d Police Station,               my duties        on that     being one of

                a number          of CID officers,           who were to work           under    the direct          control       of

                 Det.      Insp.       Towell    as    part of a P ic kp o ck e t Team,

                At .9.45am         (0945)       that    same day     1 a tt en d ed    the S h ef fi el d W ed n es d ay

                Football          Ground and together              with other       officers     I was    brief ed         in

                 relation to the               forthc om in g Semi Final        football        m atch betwee n Liverpool

                FC arid N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC.

                At    11.30am          (1130)    that    same day,     I commenced o bs er vations             regarding

                the       pickpockets          in the Leppings Lane           turnstile area along with Det,,

                Sgt.       McSloy,      Det.     Con.    Hal lam,    Det,    Con.     Locking,    a further          team was

                also       operating        i.n that area,         those    officers     being Det.       Sgt.       Smith,

                Det.       Con.    L i l l e y a n d Det.    Con.    Lindsay.

                At that       time      our     brief was     to    identify    travelling        pickpockets and if

                possible          to   carry     out a s u rv ei ll an ce     on those        persons.

                Due       to this Det.          Con.    Ha ll am was   in poss es si on of a wallet alarm,                       and

                the       remainder        of the      team were     to be    in a position         in order         to

                r esp o n d to a signal/ to be given by DC Hallam.

                O n taking up our               positions     in the are a of the L ep pings Lane                    turnstile

                and paddock area,                the area was        very quiet and the           crowd being             sparse.
                                                                                                   .. P AGE     '
                                                                                                     Riso
U ni f o r m Officers     were     on. duty      in that area,       officers were at each

t ur nstile    entrance         gate,   and officers were          on duty at a barricade                  on

the d ri veway to the rear of the S ou th stand.

F u r t h e r officers w e r e     on duty as a coach reception party                       in the area

immediately       in front        of the turnstiles.             It a pp ea re d at that           time the

number      of u ni f or m ed Police officers             was   in the      region of 40.

At    this time     the    crowd; w hi ch had started            to gather was m ix ed with

m a n y families     being       present.     The    behaviour      of the fans was good

humoured«

As    the a f t e r no o n wore    on the     crowd s te ad i ly built         up and the mood

became      fairly hostile',        because       numerous      fans were mill in g around

with ou t    tickets,      at this time          I lost    count    of the number           of    peole who

a p p ro a ch e d me and a sked w hether            I had either       tickets,to          sell    or just

spare.

I. personally saw a number                of men selling         tickets wit h        large       groups       of

people      stood a ro un d them,         who were     o b vi ou sl y trying      to buy tickets

for    the game.       Due      to this the area a ro un d the              corner    shop w hi ch        is

di re ct ly a dj acent       to the football          stad iu m became        par ti cu la rl y

congested.

The    vehicular     traffic along Leppings Lane                   itself a p p e ar e d to g ri nd to

a halt,      wit h the odd vehicle            passing,      a lt ho u gh    it should be said that

numerous      coaches an d Public Serv ic e V eh ic le s               came along          that    road

under Pol ice m o t o r cycle           escort    to the    reception area.

The    u niformed o ff icers        in that       location a tt en d ed those          vehicles and a

search of      persons       leaving      the vehicles w<as u n d e r t a k e n .

I recall      seeing      two    coaches arrive at the             same time,        two    officers

a pp r oa c h e d one vehicle and the             remainder      of the serial         6 or 8

officers a p p r o a c h e d     the other vehicle.             I recall      thinking       that there

was    less o ff icers       in that area,          than there      had been      in previous

years.       However      I must    say that        I had several          arrests    take       place

arid believe          that     this may have         drawn      strength away from the                  reception

party.

At   this    time      there were          no problems and no               real    cause      for    concern

involving        public        disorder.

It should be           pointed out that M o u n t e d officers were o p er at in g                          in the

Leppings Lane              tu rn st il e and      paddock area,            the number         of officers

being     two sergeants,                one of those      being a South; Y or k sh i re Officer,

four Police Consta bl es ,                 two of those         being male M er se y si d e            officers.

T h e M e r se y si d e officers           operating       in the area d ir ec tl y             in front of

the Paddock and turnstiles.

At a ro u nd     -I. 15'pm     (1315)      together wi th the other members, of the

Pick po ck et Team,            I w al k ed along L ep pings           Lane,        due   to    reports of

pickpockets           o pe rating        further along        the    road,      at this        time    numerous

people      just      hanging about,           sat    on the      pavement         leaning against           the

walls,      sat on the            parapet     of the bridges,              many of these         people were

drinking       from        cans and bottles           of a s s o r t e d    intoxicants.

I even recall              seeing       a very a tt ra c ti v e young lady wit h two                   friends,

drinking       from        cans    of    lager.      In the     space       o f . a p pr o xi m at e ly half an

hour    I saw this             one girl open and drink               four     cans of lager.

At around        1.30pm        (1330),       together w it h Det. Con.              H al la m and      remainder

of team,       I w a l k ed       down Leppings Lane            in the d irection of the

roundabout,           the o bs er va t io n s went        as far as the            chip shop situated                        at

the j un ction of              L ep pi ng s Lane and Bi ckerton Road,                at this         location                we

loitered.            The    crowd at this          time was      quite       dense,      still       numerous            fans

a pp r oa c hi n g    people       including myself           and asking           to buy tickets,           many

of the fans           in the area          the worse      for    drink',      quite a lot of            litter

m a i n l y beer      cans.

Wh il st walk in g          back    to the     original       o bs e rv a ti o n area         in front      of the

Paddock area,              I ident if ie d one       particular            fan as being a ticket                 tout,

I a p pr o a c h e d him,         e nq uired how much he was                selling      the    tickets at to
                                                                                                     PAGE        4
                                                                                                   ' R 180

w hich    he replied thirty             pounds.        I i mm e di a te l y a p pr o a c h e d Ins pe ct or

S ykes and '.informed' him of the                   situation.       I believe that that man was

arrested.

Due    to the d e ns it y of the           crowd,      o bs ervations      regarding      pickpockets

becamse     centred a ro un d the area                im me di at el y   in front     of the metal

fencing     in front of the Paddock                   turnstile area.           The   o bs ervations

team     loitering a r o u nd       the    corner      shop and the entrances             to both the

N o r t h stand and the Leppin gs Lane                   end standing       entrances.

Wh i l s t at this      location        I recall moving           numerous      bottles     of both

alcohol     and soft       drinks w hich had been d is carded u nd er n ea t h the

fencing and behind             in order       that     they w ou ld be out of harms way.

The M er s e y si de M ou n te d officers             together with one S ou th Y or kshire

officer      (female)      were     c on stantly moving           the    crowd on who were          just

standing about,           these     people         o b vi ou sl y had no tickets.         This was

interferring with the ope ra ti on to                       catch offenders        so muc h so that

several      likely suspects were m ov ed on by the officers.

At 2.20pm       (1420)     or t herea bouts           the    crowd became       very dense,       so much

so that the        o b se rv at io ns     team      including myself was           forced to move          out

from the area a dj ac en t            to the metal          fencing      to an area of relative

calm beneath the           signs      on the metal          fencing      further along        towards      the

entrances      to the West          stand.

Whilst at that          location        r epeatedly a s ke d       for spare       tickets     or tickets

for    sale,   those     persons        ob v io us ly now getting          very w or r ie d about

seeing     the football         match,       the m a j or i ty of those         persons     having

enqui r e d about       t i c k e t s, . mo v ed    into the    paddock area and towards

At the     present      l oc at io n I liaised w it h Det.               Sgt.   McSIoy,     who   reported

seeing an Asian w e a ri ng             glasses and s h ee ps ki n         coat    plus   one other,

constantly moving            in and out of queues               in the     paddock area.          It

from view having                 come out of the          paddock area,          therefore      it was

s u gg es te d that         the    entire       pickpocket      team w ould split          up and search

for the       two males.

D p t » S g t « McSloy,           DCs Locking and A sk ew m oved off from the area which

we    had now taken up,                 w hich was d ir ec tl y adjacent             to the    roadway and

is on a lip w hich affords a view w hi ch                           is slightly e le vated and            looks

down on the heads                 on the       persons    queue in g to gain entrance             to the

football           stadium.

A fter a short             time,    the entire           o bs e rv a ti o n team, re- jo in ed    in the

aforementioned                area,       the   crowd at this          time now being very dense and

it seemed that              from the area near to the shop, some                       considerable

distance away              right up to the ground was                   totally bloc ke d by people

mo vi n g    towards          the   ground.        By this      time vehicular          traffic had ceased

and    the entire             c ar r ia g ew a y was blocked by people.

Wh il s t    stood wit h DCs Hallam and Li 1.ley and                         looking    down    into   the

 paddock area w hi ch was                 now tota ll y full wit h            people and still         more

walking        towards       the ground,          I saw groups          of young men       pushing      into

the    crowd,        the m a j o r i t y of these         being     the worse        for drink,    I saw

several        carrying and drinking                from     large 2 litre           bottles    of both

lager and beer.

At this        time       I n oted that the P o l i c e horses were moving amon gs t                      the

dense       crowd     in front          of the    paddock area          to a ll eviate     the situation.

My    impression of the                 s itu ation was      that      the   crowd was     becoming

desperate           due   to having           no tickets and wit h rvo hope             of getting

tickets,           also    the    fact    that the       ones who       had tickets w ou ld miss          the

start       of the game           due    to    large amount       of    people    trying      to gain entry

to the stadium.                                                                  v

.I cannot          recall    the time,          but whilst      stood at this          location a Police

La n d r o v e r    came a long         the L ep pi n gs Lane,         wit h blue     light and two tone

horns       operating,           the vehicle       stop pe d near to where we were                stood.

I. looked both down and up L ep pi ng s Lane and the area was                                totally

bloc ke d    in both dire ct io ns with              people moving           towards     the football            .

ground.

■I was   now stood to one side of the La nd ro ve r with DCs H a ll a m and

Lilley,     and whilst         there.we were joined by a                    uniform    Inspector,

identity unknown.

PC Bu xt on the       driver      of the vehicle,            a li gh t ed and stood on the                body

of the vehicle and whilst                   doing    so he Was          using the v eh icles PA

system,      r ep ea te dl y stating         'Please stop          pushing      there are       people at

the front       being    crushed*.           1 noted several             large groups        of young

Liverpool       fans,    who were       pushing       into       the    crowd and making           some

headway      towards     the    turnstiles,          these       fans    pushing others         out of the

wa y „

I spoke      to several        fans    saying       'Don't go forward,             stay back'.            Many

ignored t h i s .

At this      point    I saw several           people       climbing        on the fences ar ou nd the

paddock area.           Once    climbing       into       that    position those         people were         then

helping others          up onto       the fence       tops.        I then saw one         fan      climb over

into the actual          ground,       he was       then f ol lo we d by others,             I then saw

Inspector Bennett             appear    on the       roof of the turnstile               area.       I saw

the officer as si st           several       fans    to    climb       into the ground area.

It was      obvious     at    this    stage    that m any         people were        being    crushed at

the turnstiles,          people were          not, m ov in g      through the actual            turnstiles

a nd   I recall      t hi nking      that    I couldn't          see any Police        helmets at the

'turnstiles.

B oth PC. Bu xt on an d the un known u n if or m                  Inspector were         now using         the

PA system,       r ep ea t ed l y asking       the    crowd to stop            pushing and that            there

was    people   being        crushed.        I recall       one of the officers              stating       that

game was     going to         be delayed.           The    people       still a pp r oa c hi n g    the

                                                                                                       R180

continuing        to push, forward.

The M o u n t e d officers          strength had been               increased,     and saw that those

officers were a tt em p ti n g            to get nearer             the turnstiles        to enable

people to gain entry to the ground.                             Still      no one taking any notice

and still more            people      pushing        forward.        At this time there was             no

other obvious Police m an po wer                     d ep lo ye d    in that area.        -

I observed the Pol ic e Moun te d                    inspector,        obviously shouting at the

crowd,. I noted that               his horse         seemed to be going           under due to the

people     pushing a g ai ns t         it*the        front    of the horse        star te d to rise w ith

the   rear end d i sa pp er in g           from view,         it a pp ea re d that the officer was

falling      backwards,           however,       somehow he          regained his footing.

The mood       of the       crowd was          now very d esperate and becoming more and

mo re hostile.

The anger       of the        crowd now being            direc te d at the un if or me d            officers

present,       I noted       several       people       coming       towards    both PC B ux t on and the

Inspector,        pushing at          those      officers,          saying do something,            stop the

pushing,       some       of these men were             crying       in what    I believe was

f ru s t r a t i o n at    the    situation.

PC B u x t o n who was           c on ti nually using         the PA system then d ir ected the

M oun t e d officers         to form a line             in front       of the Paddock area,             this

was   p a r tially successful,                 five Police          horses   completing       the    line,

however as        the      crowd    pushed forward the horses were                   pushed towards

the ground.

PC Bu x t o n still         a tt em p ti n g    to    reassure       the   crowd stating        that they

w ould all      get       in and    to stop          pushing.

I recall       seeing       Inspector Bennett who was still                      on the       roof of the

turnstiles        and was         still    pulling       people       onto the    roof.

B y now    I couldn't a c t u a l l y see              the t urnstiles         due to the       vast   sea of

people and still             no sign of Po li ce             helmets.        PC Bu xt on still

attempting        to reassure          the      crowd.

W hilst stood at          that    location a       large r o a r      from within the ground,               it

a p p e a r e d to me    that    the    football     teams     had come onto the          pitch,       this

being around 2 . 5 5 p m         (1453)       the moo d   of the      crowd being       desperate,

m ore and more          fans    pushing       forward,    still    many      carrying    both    cans and

bottles     of drink.

T o g ether wit h the          other   officers      of the     observ at io n team knowing             that

we    c o u l d n ’t help the sit ua ti on        I m ov ed off       down Vers Road.

Whilst walking           down that       road anot he r       large    roar from w it hi n       the

ground was        heard.        I noted that       football       fans were      running      up that

road in the        d i re ct io n of the L ep pi ng s Lane            end,    those   fans     o bviously

coming .from L iverpool. ■'

Ha vi n g w a lk e d down that          road and     into Pen is to ne Road,           I noted that

there was       very few spectators              in that area,         together with the          other

officers       1 then went        into the gym.

At 3.05pm       (1505)      or thereabouts         whilst      in the gym having meal,

in fo rmation was         received that the           crowd was        on the    pitch and that all

ava il ab le    unif or m      personnel       to a tt e nd that area.          T og ether wit h both

DCs     Locking an d ’ A s ke w        left    the gym and took up a posit io n near                   to

the entrance        to the       pitch,       however,    having      been there      only a short

time,      together w ith the other              officers      I was    instructed       to    return to

the gym to await            casualties.

Whi ls t    in the gym         1 was    i nformed that        there    had been deaths          in the

ground and was           told to       clear the gym by Chief             Inspector Beal         and to

make    it ready to         receive      corpses.

The    bodies     then began       to arrive       wi th in    the gym,       the first       person

having     bpen    carried       into that area was            thought       to be dead however             it

was    found that        he w a s n ’t dead and therefore was moved to one                       side.

The area w it h in the gym was                 now ready to       receive      the    bodies and       those

that were       brought        in were    blue    in the      face,    many o b vi ou sl y dead,        some

search the          body for       both    personal       effects and       identification,           I

handed the          officers       plastic       bags and     labels.

H av i ng    completed this          task,       a ga in together w ith other F1 CID

was    opened,       the    bodies were          then    lined up    in rows of twelve,              the

I cannot        recall      the    time    but    it was some       considerable        time    later

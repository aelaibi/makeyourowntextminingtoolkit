       testimony), death, when it occurred, may well have taken place several minutes
       after 3-15 p.m. Furthermore,, In the case of a person removed from the enclosure
       at, say, 3.10 p.m. and who was unconscious, but not brain dead, and was then
       placed in a position other than the correct "recovery" position, or who, having
       been placed in the correct position, such a position was not maintained, a
       feared consequence, an inadequate airway, may well have produced a prolonged
       atate of unconsciousness, with death eventually occurring at a much later-time
       than 3-15 p.m.

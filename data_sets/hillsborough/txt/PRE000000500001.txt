     Although sleek on the outside, A stram ax is squarely practical on the inside.
              The load volume is greater th an its main competitor. The rear doors are higher and wider-opening
     too, just to make working-life th a t bit easier. While up-front, Astram ax is equally generous in the cab,
     with more going for it than in m any cars.
           In fact, the only time the Astramax shows a mean streak is when it comes to fuel
     consumption. The petrol-engined Astramax also is equally happy on unleaded, leaded
     or any m ixture of the two. And th ere’s a miserly new 1.7 litre diesel engine.
              W hichever you choose to ra n , A stram ax can’t help b u t p ut
     your company into b etter shape.

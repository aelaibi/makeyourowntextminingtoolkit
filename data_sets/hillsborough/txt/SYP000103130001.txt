POLICE CONSTABLE 2216




DONCASTER POLICE STATION




I report that at 8.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989. I paraded at Doncaster

Police      Station      for   duty   at    the    FA    Cup        semi-final       football    match     at

Hillsborough,         Sheffield.           Along     with       other       Police     Officers      I    was

transported to Hillsborough Football Ground where on arrival at 9*^5 am the

same date, a briefing took place to all officers.

At    10.30    am the    same date,        after conclusion of the briefing,                    along with

other officers, I was transported to a point on the outskirts of Sheffield.

The    duty     of   myself     and   my    serial      was    to    stop    coaches       and mini-buses

carrying supporters            to the football match and check for alcohol and that

all persons had tickets for the match.                        There was a steady flow of traffic

at this point, all those vehicles stopped contained Liverpool supporters.

All persons I checked had tickets for the football match.                              A certain amount

of drink was taken from several of the mini-buses and at least one coach,

but it was not in large quantities.                     I was not responsible for seizing any

of    the     alcohol,    my   allotted      task was         to    speak with       the   driver    of   the

vehicle, inform him of the reasons for the check and advise him not to drop

persons off at the Ground before the vehicle had been parked up.                                    This was

to ensure       all travellers knew where               their transport was on conclusion of

the football match.

At 3*00 pm the same date,              the serial I was part of stood down from this

duty     and     went    to    the    Police      Garage,          Claywheels    Lane,      Hillsborough,
Sheffield for a meal.                   We arrived at this location at 3.10 pm the same date

and attended at the mobile canteen for a meal.

Two minutes later as I was waiting for my meal to be served, an Inspector

who    was unknown to me came running into the mobile canteen and said all

officers      immediately              to the Ground,            Leppings Lane          End,    fighting between

supporters.            I       got    into    the nearest         available      Police        transport     and was

transported to the Ground.

On arrival at the Leppings Lane End of the ground at 3-15 pm this date, I

went    immediately              to    the     turnstiles        and     saw    large     groups       of   Liverpool

supporters leaving the ground.                          There was a large Police presence outside

the turnstiles.                 I then saw some supporters carrying people out, and then

the    first      sight         of people laid in the road,                     they lay still and were               a

greyish colour,                it was obvious to me they were dead.                        I, along with other

officers,         assisted            the    injured       to    one   side,       several      needed      breathing

apparatus but only one ambulance was present at this time.                                          The scene was

very    confused,          Liverpool          supporters trying to find relatives and friends

and blaming the Police for opening the gates.

At     this    time        I    still       did   not   fully      know     what    had    occurred,        the     only

information            gained         was    that     from      Liverpool      supporters.         I was      not     in

contact       by radio with any Police Officers.                               On direction of an unknown

Inspector         we    remained            outside     the     Ground    and    assisted        the    injured      and

emergency vehicles arriving at the scene, clearing a path for them.

At 4.10 pm the same date, after all supporters had more or less left the

Ground,       I   took         up     mobile      patrol      around     the    surrounding        streets     of    the

Hillsborough Ground until stood down from this duty at 6.15 Pm this date.

I then went back to Doncaster by Police transport.

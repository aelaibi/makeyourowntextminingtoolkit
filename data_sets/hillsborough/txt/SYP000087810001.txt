             Inspector Sewell.



             At approximately 8.0 am I took Insp Sewell                     to the Hillsborough

             packed meals for the tour of duty.                   I then took Insp Sewell            on a

             All was peaceful until           perhaps half an hour before the match was due

             to start at which time there was an increase in prisoners being

             brought to the Police Room and minor                  injuries attending the St. J o h n ’s

                Ambulance Room.           My first awareness of serious problems was at

                 around 3.0pm when casualties             coming to St J o h n ’s ambulance looked more

                 serious,     e.g. unconsciousness and broken limbs.                Shortly after this

                 dead bodies were being brought in.



                Younger members of St J o h n ’s were by this time clearly overwhelmed and

                 very upset.        For a short time I comforted afew of them.                     I then

                assisted in transfering              prisoners from a cell unit a personal              carrier

                 for transport to the charge office.



                By 3.30pm there were numerous dead bodies                in the gymnasium.             I asked

                what    I could do and was told toremain on stand by, which I did.



                At approximately 4.30 pm I conveyed four doctors from the gymnasium at

                 the ground to the Royal Hallamshi re Hospital to assist in the

                treatment of casu^ities who had been taken there.                      As I returned to

                the ground perhaps                  pm.   I was told to fT3\ck up Assistant Chief

                assistance with minor transport tasks between the ground and the

                Traffic Office at Claywheels Lane.                 I also gave assistance to a lady

                who had brought her doctor husband to the ground,                    by restarting her

                 car with jump leads after she had drained the battery by leaving the

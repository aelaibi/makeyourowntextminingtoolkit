Dear   v.
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

Thank you for your recent letter concerning the above. The Chief Constable has lodged
papers at the High Court to seek a judicial review of the South Yorkshire Police Authority
decision thait they do-not have the power to fund legal costs of officers who face private
prosecutions arising from the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

Your letter was included in the bundle of papers to demonstrate to the Court that this is not
just a South Yorkshire issue and that the matter requires urgent resolution.

 I will keep you informed of developments.

 Yours sincerely




 Ian Dairies
 Assistant Chief Constable

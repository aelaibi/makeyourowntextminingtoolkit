     Thank you for your letter dated the 6th January, 1983
and with reference to our recent telephone conversation, I
am able to confirm that Yorkshire Television Ltd. do not require
to build a Permanent Scaffolded Camera Platform on Spion Kop.
     Mr. D.R. Smith of Contract Services Ltd., Outgang Lane,
Osbaldwick, York did send to you his design for the foundations
and camera tower, though, of course, the design for the camera
tower was for a typical tower that would be built by Contract
Services Ltd. before each of our visits to Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club, though, of course, the foundations would be
permanent. I will arrange for the suggested specification of
the foundations to be sent to John Aitken of the B.B.C.
     With regard to the work on the access and camera platform,
Lawrie Higgins, our Head of Sport, will be writing to Mr. W.
Pattinson of the B.B.C. Manchester, with a copy for yourselves.

                                Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. R.K. Wyld.

Dear Mr. Wyld,
           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                     Camera Facilities
     Before Christmas John Aitken at the BBC rang to discuss
the camera facilities at Hillsborough. He told us that the
BBC are unwilling to contribute towards the work on the access
platform in the South stand unless the lifting beam is
Included in the scheme. This leaves us and our client in a
difficult position for it is not clear who will be paying the
relative proportions for the work. It would therefore be
appeeciated if a decision could be made between the parties
involved as to the extent of the work and also the financial
contribution each is to make. For the time being we have
stopped work on the project.
     In the same conversation with John Aitken he expressed
reservations about the erection of a 'permanent1 scaffolded
camera platform on Spion Kop. He doubted whether the BBC
camera crews would use a 'permanent' scaffold structure. (We
assume that it is Intended that the platform should be
shared). He was expecting a covered platform constructed in
structural steelwork with a proper deck and possibly clad 3
with steel sheeting. If you do have e r e c t e d a scaffold type
structure and the BBC crews refuse to use it then there could
be times when two platforms are presentI
     Once again it seems that some agreement should be made
about the requirements and a basic design brief prepared.
     South Yorkshire County Cpuncil have informed us that any
structure at the top of Spion Kop will need planning
permission and needs to satisfy the requirements of the South
Yorkshire Act. These requirements should not create
difficulties and we can go through the necessary procedures,
with which we are familiar, on the Club's behalf.




                                  Yours sincerely,




bcc Eric England,

Dear Eric,
                     Television Facilities
       There is disagreement between ITV and BBC.
       Firstly BBC would prefer a more permanent structure at
the top of Spion Kop, steel framed and clad in colour coated
steel sheets. Obviously this is much better, but it would only
be justified if the Kop is not likely to be roofed over in the
foreseeable future.
       With regard to the facilities over the South stand, BBC
are only interested in extending the platform and the new access
ladder if a lifting beam is included.    Apparently YTV will not
contribute towards the lifting beam, and in any case we have
the complication of possible future developments behind the South
stand.
       When your Board have had the opportunity to consider the
matter I will call in for a chat.
       You will be glad to know that they do not appear to be
quibbling about paying our fees for the abortive work on the
platform in the South stand.

                                  Yours sincerely,
                                                     WE/JAS/KH/4585

                         Spion Kop - Camera Platform
            Following your telephone conversation with John Strange
yesterday, we have pleasure in enclosing a set of calculations
prepared by CSI Contract Services (Yorkshire) Ltd. for the
proposed camera platform. A copy of our letter to David Vaughan
enclosing the same calculations is also enclosed.
            We assume that because it is not a building, formal
planning permission will not be required though we would expect
it to be subject to the normal procedures for Building Regulations
approval. Perhaps you would be kind enough to clarify this point
for us please.

                                  Yours sincerely.

             Dear Mr. Vaughan,*
                                 Sheffield Wednesday Foobball Club PLC
                                      Spion Kop - Camera Platform
                         We have been passed a cppy of some calculations by
             CSL Contract Services (Yorkshire) Ltd. who have apparently been
             asked by Yorkshire Television to construct a permanent camera
             platform at the top of Spion Kop. A further set is enclosed
             and we have also sent another set directly to Don Sheriff for
             his comments.   Although not shown, we understand that they intend
             to site the tower where they erect the temporary structure. Their
             proposal appears to be structurally acceptable although we have
             requested that they construct a concrete block at the top of
             the terrace instead of using a 'Hilti' anchor as indicated on
             sheet 7.
                          You will see on sheet 1 that it is proposed to clad
             the tow<ar using plywood sheets round all four sides. If acceptable
             this will need to be good quality external ply fixed to a timber
             sub-frame and the plywood painted blue to match the barriers and
             railings.
                          We have suggested that access is gained to the platform
             from a ladder inside the tower. A simple door which can be locked



i
L
when the tower is not in use can be constructed in one of the
side walls.   The comments of the officer Working Party would
be welcomed.

Dear Mr. Wyld,
                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                            TV Tower on Spion Kop
                                            I* -                                           ,

            We have examined the calculations for the tower which were
                                            K

sent to us by Contract Services (Yorkshire) Ltd. The calculations are
acceptable but because of the uncertain nature of the concrete
forming the top step of the embankment, we would prefer to see a
concrete block foundation rather than the Hilti anchor.
            We have not received the formal comments of the Club con­
cerning the proposed plywood sheeting on the four sides but think
it likely this will be acceptable providing the plywood is fixed to
a timber frame. The plywood should be of external quality and
preferably painted. The colour should be blue to match the railings
and crush barriers (the Club colour).
            There is no mention of the arrangement for draining
water from the platform. It may be you have in mind leaving gaps
between the boards to permit the rainwater to drip through. There
would be no objection to this but if it is intended to have a
waterproof deck, appropriate arrangements should be made to dis­
charge the rainwater without causing a nuisance.
            Finally, it is suggested that the access ladder should
preferably be inside the tower. A simple doorway could be con­
structed which 10B15 be locked when the tower is not in use.
  X                                                              Yours sincerely,
                                                            4585

     Eric,
                      forkshire Television Stand
            I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the calculations
which have been sent to us by the scaffolding firm who have
apparently been asked by Yorkshire Television to construct the
tower for them.   We have checked the calculations and apart
from the fact that we would not be happy with the Hilti fixing
which is shown at the top of the steps on sheet 7, the proposal
is structurally acceptable.     We shall be requesting that a
concrete block should be used instead of the Hilti anchor.
            You will see on sheet 1 that it is proposed there
should be plywood sheeting on all four sides.     If that is
acceptable we would requfeite that the plywood be fixed to a
timber frame which in turn would be attached to the scaffolding.
The plywood should be of external quality so as to give a good
life span.   As you have suggested in our telephone conversation,
the whole lot should be painted in blue to match the colour of
the railings and crush barriers.     There is no mention on the
drawing of the access to the top of the platform. We think this
would be better placed inside the tower with an entrance door
which can be locked.

                                      Yours sincerely,

           Liverpool team coach.

           On Saturday 15 April was present on Liverpool team bench at side of

            pitch.     Does not see anything of incident except two persons climbing

            over fence at Leppings Ln end.

           During pre-match warm-up,      noticed crowd build-up in centre of terraces

           but space at each end of the West Stand.         When play abandoned, went to

           team dressing room with players and remained there.

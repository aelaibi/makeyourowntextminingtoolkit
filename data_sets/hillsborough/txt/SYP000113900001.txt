CRIME

The     mass    influx          of    supporters           and     vehicles          brings       with       it    the

possibility           of a n          increase        in a u t o     crime w h i l s t       such      vehicles          are

left     parked       and       unattended.               To   this     e n d it      was d e c i d e d      to     maintain

a CID     presence          in       those       areas.        However,         1 9 8 8 Semi       Final          h a d an

excessive        number          of    personnel           and    therefore           this       manpower          level      was

reduced        and    organised             by    the D e t e c t i v e    Superintendent.

Pickpockets           also        operated          at the     1988      event        and therefore               the n e e d        to

Superintendents            and     Chief      Inspectors          was    made    by C h i e f      Superintendent

identified                 officers          of    Inspector,,            Sergeant          and Constable                 level      who

regularly                 policed          league       matches          and    who    also        had       been     involved           in

policing              the       198S Semi          Final.           These       officers           were       additionally

allocated,                 where          possible,          identical          duties        to       those    performed             in th©

In      terrhs of m a n p o w e r               reductions           were       made       in the           following          areas:-

SENIOR              OFFICERS                                                                                                  .

Three           Inspectors                who     acted      as     liaison       officers             to S e c t o r     Commanders

were           dispensed             with    as    they were             under    employed.

One       Reserve           Serial          stationed          at    Spion       Kop/South              Stand       car       park    was

dispensed                 with       as    it w a s     under       employed.

Supervision                 of       mobile units            was     reduced          from         five to          two I n s p e c t o r s

as,        in       practice,             they could         only     be w i t h       one         u nit at a time.

Serials              1 a n d S. w e r e         increased           by 2 P o l i c e        Constables              and       1 Police

Sergeant              respectively.

Serials              11 a n d        12    (North Stand)             were       decreased              as    their       iftain t ask         of

ensuring              t h at     supporters             did    not       use    the    Penistone              Road       North       egress

did       not        require          the    manning          level       afforded           in    1988.

Serial              15 w a s     decreased            by     1 Sergeant          leaving           1 Sergeant             supervising

the        1 Serial             of    10 C o n s t a b l e s .

Further              reductions             were      made     in    respect          of    the        majority          of    peripheral

patrols              not    directly            involved          with     access          to a n d         egress       from      the

Stadium              and    one       Serial       (number          24    on    the    1988 O p e r a t i o n a l             Order)      was

the       area        allocated.

The       main        thrust          behind       these       reductions             was     the       fact    th at         in   1988

many           officers          were       under       employed          and    were       not        fully    utilised.

Superintendent               Greenwood           informed          the      officers           of    the    fact       thati the

taped      off    area       at     the    North       Wing       of    the      Spion Kop           would       be    used       for

Liverpool         supporters              who    purchased             tickets          for    that    area.           T h is*

officers         and       Mr,    Greenwood           recounted           his     experience           of       last       years

Semi     Final        and    public        disorder          which        occurred            an the       Spion       K o p at

t his     location.

Together         with Superintendent                       Greenwood,            I then        want    to a n         area     behind

the     Spion     Kop       as    this     area       is    barren        and     there        are    l o ose        stones       which

could      be    used       as    ammunition.               We    found        t h at    t h ere     were       stones        in that

area     but     neither          of    us w e r e     unduly          concerned,

I then        left     Superintendent                 Greenwood           and     walked        over       to    the       South Stand

where      Inspector             Darling        was    in the          presence          of    briefing          stewards          for

progress         and       I therefore           spoke       to    him.          He     t o l d me    t hat      he    had     heard

it all        before        but     I reminded             him    that      it w a s       important            he    paid

attention         as       'sods       law*     dictated          t hat     if    he     did    not    something             would

eventually            to    the     S p i o n Kop,         During         my     tour      I spoke         with       all

officers         on    their        respective             duties      to      ensure         that    all       officers          were

North Stand             where             I left       them.          I returned                to    the    Spion Kop           for    a

 short       while      to       monitor             the    mood      of    the       crowd          and    it a p p e a r e d    good

 As   the      crowds        increased                on    the     Spion        Kop       and       the    numbers        of L i v e r p o o l

 it   necessary             to    increase             the       number         of    officers             in t h a t     area.        The

I then spoke              with       five Liverpool               supporters                who    were; on        the     Spion Kop

behind Gate              6,     As     I did      so      I saw P o l i c e           Constable            Holmes       escorting

some    Liverpool              supporters            to    the    segregated                area      in    the    S p i o n Kop.

I advised           the       five    youths         I was       speaking             to,    to    join      them       but     they

ignored        me.         (These      youths          were      later       taken          out      of the     Spion         Kop        and

 removed       from       the       Stadium       for      their       own       safety.)

 I recall at         t his      time       hearing         radio      transmissions                  but     I was        unable              to

decipher             the       exact       content        due    to th e         noise       in the         ground        and what I

took     to    be    background             interference.                   This       was    despite          the      fact        that

my    radio        was    fitted       with       an      earpiece.              I did,       however,            hear     the       word

 "gate"       or    'gates9 mentioned                     and    I therefore                went     to     the    rear        of    the

impression was                that       a    pitch       invasion          was    taking          place.

Radio       transmissions                were       s t ill     poor     and      this,          coupled        with       the    noise

of    the     crowd,        made     any       signals          inaudible.

I immediately               instructed              all    officers          on    the       perimeter             track     to

monitor         the     crowd       on       the    Spion       Kop    as    their          m o o d was       angry        and

            si urn*and           told       the       officers       there          to    c l ear      the       area    for     use       as    a

temporary              mortuary.

I returned                 to    the       playing          area and       t here         I saw P o l i c e            Sergeant

Robinson              en    route          to    the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end,       called           him    over     to a s s i s t

turned           to    another             group       in t ime      to    see       them       covering           a youth's            f ace

took        hold       of       the    temporary             stretcher.              Together             we     carried        the     body

nuiTibe r of        people             carrying           the      injured           and      dead and           therefore              the       dead

man's       body        was       carried             by f o u r      of    us     into       the       gymnasium.             As       we     carried

the    dead man              to       the    gymnasium             X remember              urine         flowing         from       the a r e a

that     a number                of    people          (exact         number         not      known)        were        laid       on       the

police       officers                 were       in    the    a r ea ,      many        were       distressed,               some       were

angry       and     directing                insults          at      the     Police.              Detective            Sergeant             Smith

approached              me       and    stated           t hat     officers             were       not    realising            the

importance              of       remaining             with      bodies           and     I assigned             him     the       duty        of

ensuring           at    least          one       officer          remained             with       each     body        to    ensure

continuity.                  -

A    number        of    officers                were     persuading               non     police         personnel            to       leave

the    gymnasium                 and    I returned               to     the       pitch       to    rejoin          officers            there.

It was        then       apparent            t hat      t h ere     were      a number           of       officers               without

The    officers            were        retained           in this        area        until       I received

            the     officers             down.       I would      describe             the       officers           in    the    North    Stand,

            as    shocked,             saddened?         some    were       distressed             and        several       openly       wept.

            On    completion              of    this     duty,    I attended                the     gymnas ium            where    1 found         it

            had     been       divided          into     three    areas.              The    first        contained             I believe

            over     SO      bodies          and    officers      were       in       the    process           of    recording        details

            direction             of     Inspector         Charles.          I deputed              other       Inspectors          to    assist

            him     in    this         task.

            The     middle          section         of   the    gymnasium             contained           CID       Officers       whose - d u t y

            I assisted              in    the      arrangements            regarding             the     identification             process

19 May 1986              Posted to Hammerton Road Police Station as Deputy Sub

                          Divisional Commander where I am currently serving

In    addition       to    the     above      I have      attended          a Command     Band     Training

Course and a Ground Commanders Course and am presently designated as

one of the trained Ground Commanders for public disorder situations.

During     the      entire       3 years        I have      served         at   Hammerton     Road Police

Station        I    have        been    heavily         engaged       in    both    the     planning    and

policing of football matches at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground

and have been directly involved in the planning and policing of the

1987, 1988 and 1989 Semi Finals staged at the Hillsborough Stadium.

It    is true       to    say     that the planning for policing League                          games has

formed    the       basis       for    the    plans      made     in respect        of all    three    Semi

Finals,        in    particular          the       placing       of    identified         manpower     into

serials under the direct supervision of a Sergeant.                                     An Inspector is

then    allocated          a set       number      of   serials       to    supervise and deploy in

identified areas both inside and outside the stadium and either one

or more Chief Inspectors are identified for overall command                                         'on the

ground'.        The Sub Divisional Superintendent controls the operation

from     the        Police       Control        Room      with        the       assistance    of    radio,

telephone/public             address         and    video    camera         operators.        On   matches

with anticipated large attendances or with a history of trouble or

intelligence          regarding          anticipated            trouble,         then   the   Divisional

Chief Superintendent takes overall command.

The planning for Semi Finals                       is more complex by the very nature of

the    fact    there       is    no home       support      and    therefore the importance of

segregation becomes even more significant and problematic.
Itemised below are the areas taken into consideration when planning

such    Semi    Finals          but    before       covering         that    area     the    strategy       and

reasons        for        the     methods           of      segregation            employed        requires

explanation.



SEGREGATION

The geographical location of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club plays

an     important      part        in        the     decision         making     process       so     far     as

segregation is concerned both in terms of approach routes as well as

the division of the Stadium itself.

The Stadium is situate to the north of Sheffield city centre and is

served, from the north, by the A61 and A616 and exits 36, 35A and 35

from the Ml motorway.                       Its southerly aspect               is served by the A616

and A57 and by exits 29, 30, 31, 33 and 34 from the Ml motorway.

The     natural      routes           for     arriving         at     the    ground     therefore          lend

themselves to a Middlewood Road and Halifax Road approach in terms

of     supporters      approaching                from    the       north    and    Herries        Road    and

Penistone Road for supporters approaching from the south.

This    applied      in respect             of    all    three      Semi    Finals,    Leeds being the

northerly club in 1987 and Liverpool                             in 1988 and 1989 and Coventry

being the southerly club in 1987 and Nottingham in 1988 and 1989.

Additionally,        Wadsley          Bridge       Railway          Station,    which       is maintained

through funds        supplied by the Football Trust,                            is utilized on match

days only and as this is sited to the north of the ground,                                          then it

follows    that      it must          be    used for the club whose                 approach route          is

from that direction. Midland Railway Station which is situate in the

city    centre       is     therefore             used     for       receiving      clubs      using       the

southerly      approach.              It    is    true    to     say    that    normal      British       Rail
services        lead       to   supporters           from      both    clubs      arriving       at   Midland

Railway        Station      and       'D'   Division,          West    Bar,     who    police    this    area,

operate a contingency plan to segregate fans at this location.

There     is       close    liaison         between        the    police        and    British       Transport

Police and British Rail officials in this respect, as the timing of

arrivals       is    crucial          to    the    effectiveness          and    efficiency       of police

operations.

Similarly,         South Yorkshire Transport have an important part to play

in    terms     of    transporting            supporters          to   the    Stadium whilst            at   the

same time maintaining segregation and to this end close liaison is

maintained with members                     of this       service.       This    is also important in

terms of the large numbers of coaches scheduled to bring both groups

of    supporters        and       South      Yorkshire          Transport        also    provide      parking

space     on    their       premises,         close       to    the    Stadium,       again     to maintain

segregation          (this is developed later).

The areas within the stadium having the greater crowd capacities are

the Spion Kop          (21000)         and the West Stand and Leppings Lane Terraces

combined        (14565).          Each       of    these       areas     is   behind     one    of    the    two

goals on the field of play.

The Spion Kop is accessed via turnstiles in Penistone Road North and

the    South        Stand       car    park        and    the     West    Stand        and    Terraces       via

turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

Bearing       in    mind    the       natural       approach       routes,       the    Spion    Kop     lends

itself to use by supporters using the southerly routes                                        (Coventry and

Nottingham)          and    the       West        Stand     and   Terraces        lend       themselves      to

supporters using northerly approach routes                               (Leeds and Liverpool).

The North Stand is accessed via turnstiles in both Leppings Lane and

Penistone Road North and again with segregation at the forefront of
ones    mind,        by    not    taking       the    Penistone          Road    North       turnstiles       into

use,    one     can designate             Leppings          Lane    as    for    use by Liverpool             (and

Leeds    in     the       case     of    1987)      supporters.           This    stand        has   a seating

capacity of 9705.

As   supporters            occupying          the    Spion    Kop     will      use    turnstiles        in    the

area     behind           the    South        Stand    it     is     logical          that    the     remaining

turnstiles           in    this        area,     which       service       the    South        Stand    itself,

should        also    be        used    by     those       supporters.          The    capacity        for    this

seated area is 8834.

There then remains one grey area where the possibility of supporters

from either team meeting in large numbers exists and that is in the

area of the service road leading from Leppings Lane to the rear of

the South Stand car park and ultimately Penistone Road North.                                                 This

route is kept open on League match days for through traffic and home

supporters.

On     Semi    Final        days       this    area    is     closed       and    sterility          maintained

using portable barriers manned by police officers.                                           Effectively       the

service road is closed at its Leppings Lane end and also at a point

close to the rear of the Police Control Room.

This division of the ground results                                in a combined capacity for                  the

two segregated areas as follows:

LIVERPOOL

West Stand                                          4465

Leppings Lane Terraces                              10100

North Stand                                         9705



                                                    24270
NOTTINGHAM

Spion Kop                                          21000

South Stand                                         8834



                                                   29834

The question of accessing the North Stand via turnstiles 77 to 88 in

Penistone       Road      has been considered but this presents                                 the following

problems:

The fact that             supporters         of the other team would also be utilizing

this     area        immediately              presents          a        potential        public       disorder

situation.          The     geography of this               area presents               a dual carriageway

(four lanes) of one of the city's main arterial roads.                                           It is also a

large    area       which     would         need    to     be    sealed         using    great       numbers    of

portable       barriers        and          uniform      personnel.             Even    if    that     could    be

achieved,       the       length       of    road     opposite           to the    turnstiles         comprises

light    industry          with    large       forecourts           which,        in    themselves,         create

problems       in     terms       of    sterility.              Additionally,            coaches       carrying

supporters       from       the    south        are      parked          in   Herries        Road,    the    South

Yorkshire       Transport          premises         accessed             from    that    road    and    Herries

Road    South       and    therefore          the     close      proximity         of    large       numbers    of

supporters of both teams in itself presents a formula for potential

public disorder on a large scale.

The    above    considerations                are   made        and      conclusions          drawn    with    the

accent    being       placed       on        segregation            in    line    with       recommendations

contained in the Popplewell Report and the Standing Instructions for

Policing Football Matches and the Green Guide.

A further option would have been to use the North Stand, West Stand

and Leppings          Lane Terraces            for Nottingham supporters                       and the Spion

Kop and South Stand for Liverpool                          supporters.             Having regard to the
geographical             features         previously          described       this            would    have     meant

undertaking a re-routing exercise in every respect, supporters using

their own transport would have still approached the Stadium from the

same directions and the possibility of both meeting as their routes

overlapped          and        crossed          would    again         present        a       potential       public

disorder problem not only within the county but further afield.

A final option would have been to draw an imaginary line across the

centre    of     the         Stadium thereby dividing the North                               and     South stands

and    giving       each           set    of    supporters         a   half     of        the    Stadium.           The

physical construction of the ground does not lend itself to this and

would     have       presented             potential         public      disorder             problems        in    the

service road at the rear of the South Stand outside the Stadium,                                                     in

the refreshment and toilet areas at the rear of the North and South

stands    proper             and    in    the     actual      stands      themselves.                 This   problem

would be a constant one and be ever present both before, during and

after the game.

The     question             changing       the     combination          of     areas           of    the    Stadium

occupied       would          have       resulted       in    an   even    greater             disporportionate

allocation          of       tickets       to     the   two    clubs      concerned.             This       would    be

unacceptable to them and is therefore not an option at all.

In    terms    of        actual      planning,          once   the      above    parameters              have      been

agreed,       and        I    must       stress     that      acceptance         is       a     matter       for    the

Football      Association,               following       consultations           between             the club and

the    police        as       to     how       effective       policing         of        the    event       can     be

achieved, the following considerations come into play.

Reference is first made to the previous years Operational Order and

the lessons learned.

In the case of Liverpool                        -v- Nottingham Forest                 1988,          the following
points were identified by Superintendent Murray and either actioned

or reinforced:

           1.    Communications           (U H F ) had       been    interrupted          by    local

                 radio.       An    immediate            survey     was    conducted           by    the

                 Superintendent               (Communications)             but     the         police

                 equipment     could          not be faulted.             It was also found

                 that   officers         within       the    Stadium had difficulty                   in

                 hearing transmissions made and therefore ear pieces

                 were   ordered         for    issue      to all officers with radios

                 within the ground for the 1989 Semi Final.

           2.    Transmissions          in     relation       to    problems       with    traffic

                 from mobile units were received at Force Operations

                 Room and were not monitored by the Police Constable

                 Room within the Stadium.                    It was considered sensible

                 that any future Semi Final would utilize this format

                 and,     indeed,       Chief        Superintendent             (Operations          and

                 Traffic)     undertook             to    organise        and    implement           all

                 matters           in     relation to        traffic including             manning

                 identified road junctions for manual direction.

           3.    Hand made traffic signs and parking signs were used

                 in 1988 due to financial reasons.                          In 1989 the club

                 agreed        to       pay         for AA     signs      and      these            were

                 complimented by additional hand made signs to assist

                 supporters in finding car parking areas.

           4.    The    use    of         search         squads     at Oughtibridge                  and

                 Tankersley         had       the    counter        productive       effect           of

                 causing       undue          delays in      coaches      and     transit           vans

                 arriving at the Stadium.                     For 1989,         it was decided

                 that   one   team        only      would     be    at    each     location          for
     selective checks               and that all personnel outside the

     Stadium       would       be     charged      with       selective          checking.

     Adhesive        stickers         were       used    to    identify           vehicles

     checked to assist officers at subsequent locations.

5.   CCTV was used at Wadsley Bridge Railway Station, the

     monitor       for    same      being     sited      in the Police Control

     Room.        This took up valuable space and it was agreed

     that this would not be implemented in 1989.                                    Having

     said that, portable video cameras had been purchased

     for use by the Force via the Football Trust and it

     was decided to utilize these in 1989.

6.   It     was     found        that       as     Phase       II      of     the       game

     approached,          a     number       of    peripheral          serials          were

     under     employed          and     therefore         Serial          Instructions

     were     amended          to      utilize      this        manpower          in     the

     Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North areas of the

     ground        throughout          this       phase        until        the     'final

     whistle'.

7.   At the end of the 1988 Semi Final there was a pitch

     invasion        by    Liverpool          supporters            from     the       North

     Stand.         Serial      Instructions            were    therefore         amended

     for    1989     to   ensure       and       increase      in manning           levels

     around       the     perimeter           track       to     cater        for      this

     eventuality.

8.   A    general    complaint         was made         regarding          the    quality

     of meals       and       plans    were      therefore made,            in liaison

     with Headquarters catering to provide a hot meal to

     all personnel whilst the game was in progress.
                                                                                              I




9.    As    Leppings       Lane       traffic       island        was   a    potential

      flashpoint at Phase III and a point where both sets

      of supporters would be close to each other, the 1989

      Order should direct extra manpower to that location

      at the end of the game.

10.   If possible,         the    SYT buses         in Penistone Road North

      should queue closer to Catchbar Lane and so help to

      keep       Nottingham           supporters            further         away       from

      Leppings       Lane    traffic         island.         We     should    approach

      the club regarding financing of AA direction signs.

11.   As    an     ambundance          of    call      signs       could      lead      to

      confusion,       officers         of    the    rank of        Chief    Inspector

      and above should use their own name.

12.   As always, officers on the West Stand Serial must be

      extra      vigilant      regarding        fans      climbing up from the

      terracing into the Stand.

13.   We    must     provide      a    sterile       area     on    the     Spion      Kop

      (north       wing)     to       house     Liverpool           supporters         who

      purchased tickets for that area.

14.   The     1988     Order          resulted       in      some       officers        on

      peripheral       Serials          being       under    employed.             A   10%

      reduction therefore should be sought and could be
                   achieved       by reducing            those       Serials       from 1 Sergeant

                   and 10 Police Constables to 1 Sergeant and 8 Police

                   Constables          and   mobile        units      from     1 Sergeant             and    6

                   Police       Constables           to     1        Sergeant        and     5    Police

                   Constables.          A standby resource of officers at Phase

                   III should be introduced into Phase II of the Order,

                   comprising          50    officers           in    Leppings       Lane        and        50

                   officers       in    Penistone          Road       North.        Police       coaches

                   should be used to house the officers.

           15.    To     negate mobile            units    being utilized            for     prisoner

                   transportation,           three transit vans                 to be identified

                   for     that     purpose.              The    hand     held       CCTV        used       at

                   Wadsley        Bridge         Railway    Station          for     the 1988          Semi

                   Final was ineffective and took up valuable space in

                   the    Control       Room       and     therefore         would     not       be    used

                   this y e a r .

           16.    As     last     year,      a    Communications             Officer       should           be

                   available during the match.

           17.    The     Winn      Gardens         car     parking          contingency              would

                   appl y .

Having regard     to the above, it will be seen that the 1988 Semi Final

wassuccessfully    policed       and    therefore,          the      Operational            Order       for

that event was used as a format for the 1989 Operation.

The following factors were discussed and actioned:
SUPPORTERS - VEHICLES

Given     the   previously   outlined       approach        routes,        and    with     the

segregation     in   mind,     it   was     decided      that       identical          parking

facilities would be afforded as those in 1988, viz:



        Liverpool    Coaches        Claywheels        Lane      and        Halifax       Road

                                    (facing away from city)                with a further

                                    overspill        facility        in     Halifax      Road

                                    (outside    Gallaghers          Limited      and    facing

                                    towards city)

                     Vans           Wardsend Road North

                     Cars           Parson Cross and Foxhill estates with

                                    a      contingency        for         utilizing      Winn

                                    Gardens area should the need arise



                     SYT            From    Midland     Station       using      a     defined

                                    circuitous        route     avoiding          Penistone

                                    Road     North     to     allow        supporters       to

                                    alight in Leppings Lane

        Nottingham   Coaches        Herries Road Bus Depot, Herries Road

                                    and Herries Road South

                     Vans           Rawson Spring Road

                     Cars           Neepsend side of ground

                     SYT            From    Midland      Station      along       Penistone

                                    Road debusing adjacent to Spion Kop
SYT     buses        would        be     positioned          in     Halifax         Road      for    Liverpool

supporters       and        in    Penistone       Road      for     Nottingham         supporters        at    the

end of the game to achieve segregation.

Coaches would discharge their passengers once parked to ensure that

individuals          knew where           to    return      to     on    completion        of    the    game    (a

lesson learned from 1987).

It was    intended,              therefore,       that pedestrians would find themselves

on the correct side of the football                               stadium and any conflict would

thereby be avoided.

INTELLIGENCE

Detective       Sergeant           Charlesworth,            'F'    Division         Intelligence        Office,

collates all pre-match intelligence and the preparation for the 1989

Semi     Final        was    no        different.           He     has        excellent       contacts        with

officers        policing           the         home    stadiums              for    both    Liverpool          and

Nottingham clubs and compiled a comprehensive document in respect of

both    sets     of    supporters.              It is true to say that the intelligence

presented a fairly low key picture and gave no cause for concern in

respect of predictable eventualities.

This     officer       has        an    additional          role        in    respect      of    policing       of

football       matches           and    that     is   in    respect          of    licensed     premises.       He

visits    each        licencee          of   public        houses       in    the    surrounding        area    to

ascertain their intended mode of operation on match days ie whether

the     premises        will           close     or    operate          a     selective         door.         This

information was supplied to serials outside the ground on Semi Final

day.

Additionally, experience at the 1988 Semi Final showed that football

supporters       purchased             large    amounts       of    alcohol         from   'off licences'.

In     view     of     this,           Detective       Sergeant          Charlesworth's             brief      was
ting     off      licences.           Furthermore,           the       importance      of    monitoring

licensed         premises     was     included       in Serial         Instructions      and the main

body of the covering report to the Operational Order.

Whilst      on    the    subject      of    alcohol,     Chief         Superintendent       Duckenfield

gave     consideration           to        applying     to       the     Magistrates'        Court        for

Restriction         Orders      under       Section     67   of    the     Licensing        Act    1964    as

amended by Section 3 of the Licensing Act 1988.                                  However,         I advised

him that this power was limited to closure between 2.30 pm and 5.30

pm    and    when    one      bears    in mind        the    20 minutes         'drinking         up   time'

allowed,         the closure would not be effective until 2.50 pm, by which

time    it would be anticipated that the majority of supporters would

be en route to the ground.                   An application, therefore, was not made.

The    intelligence           referred      to above        is    on going      and current on the

day of play notwithstanding the preparation                              of a written report.

PUBLICITY

In order to encourage                 supporters       to attend the Stadium as early as

possible,         arrangements         were    made,        through       Headquarters        for      local

radio       announcements        in     Sheffield,          Liverpool,        and   Nottingham,           for

items    in local papers              and for publications               in Match Programmes for

home     games          immediately         preceding        the       Semi     Final,      encouraging

supporters         to attend between            10.30       am    and 2.00pm to ensure their

safe and speedy entry into the Stadium.

TICKETS

Liaison      with       the   club    was     made    regarding          pronounced      colouring        of

tickets for specific areas to avoid confusion and the club, in turn,

also     placed         signs    of    appropriate           colours       at    the     entrances        to

respective turnstiles to further assist supporters.

It was further agreed with the club that tickets supplied to the two
«




    competing clubs for issue/sale would not be transferable and any not

    sold would be returned to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to avoid

    re-allocation which could lead to a mix of supporters.

    Tickets giving access to the Spion Kop were overprinted                                                     'NOTTINGHAM

    FOREST AREA'            and those for Leppings Lane Terraces                                 'LIVERPOOL AREA'.

    This    was        in    order        to     emphasize         which       area        of     the        Stadium       was

    occupied       by        who     and       to    combat       the     ruse       employed           in        1988    when

    Liverpool          supporters          purchased            tickets    for       the    Spion Kop and                 then

    claimed ignorance of the fact that they were at the                                               'wrong end' and

    request police escort to their correct side of the Stadium.

    An   additional           contigency            was     agreed      with        the    club       that        the    north

    wing    of    the        Spion       Kop     would      be    kept    for       occupation             by     Liverpool

    supporters         who     still       purchased             tickets       for    the       Spion Kop.               Their

    safety       was    maintained             utilizing         officers        from      one        of     the     Serials

    designated          to    the        Spion      Kop    and     positioning            same    between           the    two

    sets of supporters.

    ARRESTS

    Hammerton          Road        Police        Station         was     identified             for        reception        of

    Nottingham          Forest           supporters         arrested           during       the        operation           and

    Ecclesfield Police Station for Liverpool supporters.

    Arrests       within           the     ground         and    its     immediate          vicinity              would     be

    processed          initially          at     the      Police    Room       at    the    rear           of     the    North

    Stand by a team identified for that purpose and temporary detention

    was set using 2 mobile cell units. Additional mobile cell units were

    identified         for     the       two     aforementioned           police          stations           to    increase

    their    facilities.             Prisoner          process         teams    were       also       identified           for

    each station.

    Procedures          for        dealing          with    persons        arrested             and     ejected           were
reviewed, found to be satisfactory and re-implemented.

Additionally, to avoid congestion at the Police Room, it was decided

that       3    transit        vans       with    drivers,        would    be     available       to    take

prisoners to the identified police stations as previously mentioned.

Further         use    was     to    be    made    of    these    vehicles       by   placing     them    at

strategic locations outside the ground at the end of play to act as

temporary forward holding areas.

CRIME

The    mass       influx        of       supporters       and    vehicles       brings     with    it    the

possibility            of an       increase       in auto       crime whilst       such vehicles         are

left parked and unattended.                        To this end it was decided to maintain

a    CID       presence       in    those    areas.        However,       1988    Semi    Final    had    an

excessive number of personnel and therefore this manpower level was

reduced and organized by the Detective Superintendent.

Pickpockets            also operated at the 1988 event and therefore the need

to pursue this problem was also identified.

COMMUNICATIONS

Arrangements            for        this    facility       were     repeated,       including       battery

powered back up. The need for earpieces for officers working within

the     Stadium         was        recognised      and     implemented          through    Headquarters

Communications Department.

EMERGENCY SERVICES

Details          of    the     proposed          routes     and       parking    were     sent     to    the

Ambulance and Fire Services by Force Operations.

Contingency            plans        in     the    event     of    a    major     disaster        had    been

discussed by Superintendent Murray in 1988 with particular emphasis

on approach and liaison officers within the ground.

In    terms       of    First       Aid,    St    John's    Ambulance       Service       would   provide
treatment in the case of minor injuries                         (as per normal match days).

They would utilize their room which is adjoining the Police Room at

the rear of the North               Stand and would have an ambulance on standby

at the rear of Police Control.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURES

These    procedures      are written          into the Serial               Instructions         of those

police    personnel      affected,         they       have    been tested          twice       during the

1988/89     season,      (1   February        1989      Symod       Cup     and    18    February       1989

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club -v- Southampton) and were reviewed

prior to the Operational Order being ratified and going to print.

Additionally,        the role of the stewards cannot be understated in this

respect.        To   this     end    they     were      briefed       by    Inspector          Sewell    and

Police     Sergeant     Goddard       in    the       close    season        (August      1988)       and    4

Inspectors      were     identified         to    pursue       this       specific       task    on     Semi

Final    day    in each of      the       four main          areas    of    the    ground viz         Spion

Kop, North Stand, South Stand and West Stand (including terraces).

During    the    two    weeks       leading      up    to    the     Semi    Final       all    perimeter

track gates were inspected by myself and faults were found with the

springs to the release latches for Gates 1 and 4 accessing Leppings

Lane    Terraces       and    Gate    1     accessing         the    Spion        Kop.     These        were

repaired by the club prior to Semi Final day.

MISCELLANEOUS

Before dealing with Serial Instructions and manpower deployment,                                            it

will be appreciated that further arrangements in respect of Property

Seized     through      searches,         Found       Property,       Missing/Found             Children,

Complaints      and Discipline,            Press,      Private       Vehicles       owned by police

officers,      vehicle removal            (obstruction,         no waiting cones)               Overtime,

Standing    Down     From Duty and the logistical                     implications             in respect

of refreshments, radio issues, briefing and de-briefing, seating,
vehicle     distribution                are all          crucial     to        the     effectiveness                and

efficient      running        of        the    operation.                All        were        the    subject       of

discussion prior to firming up.

Inspection of the surrounding area for obstructions,                                             road works and

debris were also carried out both by Inspector Sewell and myself and

liaison    was   maintained             with       Traffic        Administration                in    relation       to

road   works     and     excavations                by     the    Gas      Board           in    Parkside          Road

identified       7.50    am        on     15       April     1989        and        arrangements            made     to

rectify.

LIAISON

An   excellent     liaison              has been         established           with        the       club   and     any

problems    discussed         on         an informal         basis.            An    example          of    this    is

where stewards have been found to be lacking in their performance of

duties then the club has been told by me and the matter acted upon.

Liaison     took        the    form           of         formal     meetings                with        interested

parties/agencies         and       informal          contact        on    a one        to       one    basis       both

personally and via telephone between the following:

       Divisional Chief Superintendent

       Deputy Divisional Commander

       Sub Divisional Commander

       Deputy Sub Divisional Commander

       Fifth Inspector and staff (two Sergeants)

       Chief Superintendent                (Operations and Traffic) and

       representatives         (Mounted and Dogs)

       Headquarters Communications

       Detective Superintendent                     'F' Division CID and representatives

       Assistant Chief Constable                    (Operations)

       South Yorkshire Transport
      British Transport Police

      British Rail

      Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

      Nottingham Forest Football Club

      Liverpool Football Club

      Football Association

      Merseyside Police

      Nottinghamshire Constabulary

      Sector Commanders and their Chief Inspectors

      South Yorkshire County Council Highways Department

In   practice      the    mechanics          of    the       above    with    the       exception        of two

meetings      arranged          by     the       Divisional          Commander,              was    engineered

through myself and/or Inspector Sewell.

MANPOWER
So    far     as     Senior          Officers          are        concerned,           the     selection       of

Superintendents             and        Chief           Inspectors           was         made        by      Chief

Superintendent           Mole     having         regard      to    their     previous          experience       in

policing Semi Finals and League games.

Once requests had been made,                      through Force Operations,                        for manpower

to meet the needs identified                       (following          scrutiny of the duties to

be   performed        and       areas       to    be     covered)       together             with     Inspector

Sewell,     I identified             officers       of    Inspector,         Sergeant and Constable

level   who     regularly         policed         league        matches      and       who     also   had     been

involved      in     policing         the    1988        Semi      Final.         These        officers      were

additionally         allocated,         where       possible,         identical          duties       to    those

performed       in    the       past    to        couple        knowledge         of     the       location     to

expertise.

In terms of manpower reductions were made in the following areas:-
                                                                                               si I



SENIOR OFFICERS

Three Inspectors who acted as liaison officers to Sector Commanders

were dispensed with as they were under employed.

One   Reserve    Serial    stationed at Spion Kop/South Stand car park was

dispensed with as it was under employed.

Supervision of mobile units was reduced from five to two Inspectors

as, in practice, they could only be with one unit at a time.

Serials    1 and   2 were    increased by 2 Police Constables and 1 Police

Sergeant respectively.

Serials 11 and 12         (North Stand) were decreased as their main task of

ensuring that supporters did not use the Penistone Road North egress

did not require the manning level afforded in 1988.

Serial 15 was decreased by 1 Sergeant leaving 1 Sergeant supervising

the 1 serial of 10 Constables.

Further    reductions       were     made     in   respect      of     the    majority    of

peripheral      patrols    not directly      involved with access            to and egress

from the Stadium and one Serial               (number    24 on the 1988 Operational

Order)    was    deleted     as    the    remainder      in    Middlewood      Road    could

adequately patrol the area allocated.

The main    thrust      behind    these   reductions     was   the   fact that       in 1988

many officers were under employed and were not fully utilized.

SERIAL INSTRUCTIONS

In    addition     to     reductions,       changes     were    made     to    the    Serial

Instructions themselves.

As previously mentioned,           the comparative smooth running of the 1988

Semi Final suggested that the majority of details implemented, with
the   alteration        already     itemised,     would      be    repeated    for     the      1989

operation.       To this end the Serial Instructions for 1989 were copied

and scrutinized separately.

Those    which      amount    to   pure    semantics      have     been    excluded    from the

following list:

Serial    8    were    instructed     at     Phase    III    to     join    Serial    2    on    the

perimeter track

Serial 19 was instructed to join Serials 30 at Leppings Lane Traffic

island at Phase III

Serial 20 was directed to the perimeter track at Phase III

Serial 21 was similarly directed

Serial    26 was reminded of the car parking facility in Hillsborough

Park and the need for special attention at Phase III

Additionally,         this Serial was       to take up standby duties in Leppings

Lane at Phase II and then meal               at half time

Serial 30 to join Serial           26 at Phase       II

Serial 31 to join Serial           26 at Phase       II

Serial 32 to join Serial           26 at Phase       II

Serial 33 to join Serial           26 at Phase       II

Serial    34 to meal         and then take up standby duties in Leppings Lane

at Phase II

Serial    35   to     join   Serial   34    at   Phase    II.     At   Phase   III    to   assist

Serials   30 and       31    at Leppings Lane traffic             island and then proceed

to Claywheels Lane           to assist with loading of coaches

Serial 36      at Phase II to      join Serial       34

Serial 37      at Phase II to      join Serial       34

Serial 38 at Phase II to join Serial                   34.      At Phase II to take up a

position on the perimeter track
Serial    40 at Phase         III to       join Serials       30 and 31 at Leppings Lane

traffic    island      and    then     proceed     to    Halifax      Road   to   assist    with

coach loading

Serial    41 at Phase         II to take up standby duties in Penistone Road

North and meal after half time

Serial    44   at Phase       II to    join Serials          30 and    31 at Leppings Lane

traffic island.

Serial 45 at Phase II to return to Tankersley as a mobile unit

Serial    52 at Phase II to meal and then standby duties in Penistone

Road North

Serial 53 to join Serial 52 at Phase II

Serial 54 at Phase II to join Serial 52

Serial 55 at Phase II to join Serial 52

Serial 56 at Phase II to join Serial 52

Serial 57 to join Serial 41 at Phase II

Serial 58 to join Serial 41 at Phase II

Serial 59 to join Serial 41 at Phase II

Serial 60 to join Serial 41 at Phase II

The whole principal of the Operational Order is one of flexibility.

It   is   designed       to   place        manpower     at    identified     locations      with

written    instructions         as    to    the   duties      they    will   be   required       to

perform.       It is not definitive and there is no bar in utilizing the

officers       for    other    duties        should     the    need     arise.      It     is     a

requirement that any such utilizing be through Police Control.                                   It

is through this channel that requests for manpower and redeployment

can be effectively achieved and monitored.

During the preparation of the Operational Order all points were the

subject    of        discussion       and     agreement       before     final     proof        and
circulation         to     all     mentioned          on     the    distribution             list     on     the

evening of 5 April 1989.

Additionally,             each     Inspector          received           a     copy     of     the       Serial

Instructions         pertaining          to those          under    his       command,       together       with

relevant parts of the covering report to the Order in precis form.

Serial       Sergeants      also        received      copies        of    their       respective         Serial

Instructions.

On 29 March 1989, together with Superintendent Murray and Inspector

Sewell,      I attended a meeting at Divisional Headquarters with Chief

Superintendent            Duckenfield          in    his    office,          where    we    discussed        the

Operational         Order        and    how       arrangements        were      firming        up.        Minor

amendments were made to the Order but otherwise it was all right.

The    Operational          Order       was       completed,        approved          and     subsequently

circulated on the evening of 5 April 1989.

At    9.00    am     on    Saturday          15     April     1989,       I    paraded       for     duty    at

Hammerton Road Police Station.                        The weather was fine and sunny.                          I

travelled          with     Superintendent              Murray           to     Sheffield          Wednesday

Football Stadium where my duties were in the areas of the Spion Kop

and   the     South        Stand,       my    Sector        Commander          being       Superintendent

Greenwood.

Together      with         all other          officers       involved          in    policing the          Semi

Final,    I took a seat in the North Stand where Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield        briefed        all    concerned          using    a public          address       system.

During       his     briefing,           he        identified         all       Sector        Commanders,

Superintendent Murray and Detective Superintendent McKay.

Superintendent             Murray         then        briefed            all        officers         as      to

communications             and emergency             evacuation           procedures,              informing

everyone      that         the two       tests       carried        out       previously           had     been




                                                                                                                   J
successful,          in   fact     I believe       the word         'excellent'       was       used.      Mr

Murray        was     followed         by     Detective         Sergeant          Charlesworth           who

appraised          everyone      as   to the      current      intelligence          concerning         both

Liverpool and Nottingham supporters.

Finally,       Inspector         Sewell      informed all officers regarding issue of

radios,       meals       and not to         'stand down'      without       authority of Police

Control.

The    main    briefing          ended      and   I subsequently            joined    Superintendent

Greenwood          on the    Spion Kop where we               spoke with       Inspectors          Calvert

and    Booth        and    their      respective       Serials.           During     this       briefing,

Superintendent              Greenwood informed the officers of the fact that the

taped off area              at the North Wing of the Spion Kop would                             beused for

Liverpool          supporters         who    purchased        tickets       for    that area.           This

segregation area would, of necessity, require containment by police

officers       and Mr       Greenwood         recounted       his    experience       of    last        years

Semi Final and public disorder which occurred on the                                     Spion Kop at

this location.

Together       with         Superintendent          Greenwood,          I    then went to         an     area

behind       the    Spion    Kop as         this area       is barren and there are loose

stones which could be used as ammunition.                             We found that there were

stones in that area but neither of us were unduly concerned.

I then       left    Superintendent           Greenwood and walked over to the South

Stand     where       Inspector          Darling    was       in    the     process        of     briefing

stewards       for that       area.         One   steward was         walking      away whilst            the

briefing was in progress and I therefore spoke to him.                                      He told me

that    he    had     heard      it   all     before    but    I reminded          him     that    it was

important          he paid attention as             'sods law'        dictated that             if he did

not something would go wrong in his particular area.
I then proceeded to patrol the perimeter track,                                             South Stand,               South

Stand        car    park,           sterile      area,       Penistone             Road    North          and    returned

eventually              to    the     Spion       Kop.        During          my    tour        I   spoke        with    all

officers           on    their        respective            duties       to    ensure       that          all    officers

were        performing            their       allocated       duties          and    that       none       of them had

any problems.                 I repeated this procedure at regular intervals.

At     12    noon        as       spectators         began        to    enter       the     Stadium,            Liverpool

supporters              were      identified           on    the       Spion       Kop    and       the    segregation

plan        at    the        North       Wing    was       implemented             using    officers             from    the

Spion Kop Terrace Serial.

I    recall        seeing          Police       Constable          Green       apprehend            a youth        in the

Spion        Kop    whilst           I was       stood       near      to     the    segregated             area.        The

youth was wearing a green rugby                               jersey and was struggling.                            I went

to     his       assistance           and       ascertained            that    the        youth      had        made    rude

gestures           (masturbating)               to     the    Nottingham            Forest          supporters.            I

helped Police Constable Green take the youth to the Police Room at

the rear of the North Stand where I left them.                                                  I returned to the

Spion Kop for a short while to monitor the mood of the crowd and it

appeared good humoured.

I    continued           to       tour    the     Serials         under       my    supervision             at    regular

intervals but no problems were being experienced.

As     the       crowds           increased          on     the    Spion       Kop        and       the    numbers        of

Liverpool          supporters             in the          segregated        area on the Kop increased,

then    I        found       it    necessary         to     increase          the    number         of     officers       in

that        area.             The     number          of     Liverpool             supporters             on     the     Kop

eventually reached well in excess of 500 and Inspector Calvert and

an entire Serial were eventually utilized.

Throughout          my        tour       of   duties        I maintained             personal             contact       with
Superintendent                Greenwood           and     gave      that        officer         regular      updates

regarding the areas under my direct supervison.

At    one       particular          stage       I believe          arround       2.15      pm    I became      aware

that    my radio             was    transmitting             intermittently.               By that        I mean         I

could only hear approximately every other word.                                            I informed Police

Control          and    stated           I    intended       to    change       my radio         battery      at    the

Gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.

I made          my    way     via    the        South     Stand      car    park       where      I spoke          to    a

Mounted          Officer           who        informed        me     he     was      experiencing            similar

difficulties                with    his          radio.      I     walked       up   Penistone         Road    North

where       I was       struck           by    the    lack    of    traffic          and   comparative         small

number           of     Nottingham              Forestsupporters                queueing         outside       the

turnstiles.             In fact I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit in the Range

Rover and recall passing comment on the self same subject.                                                    I then

went       to    the    gymnasium              and    exchanged       my    radio       battery        but    a test

transmission revealed no improvement.                                     I therefore walked onto the

perimeter track via the access route between the Spion Kop and the

North Stand;                the time would be approximately 2.30 pm.                                      I noticed

that       the       Spion     Kop       was    approximately             two    thirds         full   whilst       the

North Stand was only half full.                                  The West Stand was filling nicely

but    plenty          of    empty       seats were          visible       and whilst            the   two    centre

pens       were       filling       up        there   was    plenty        of    room at         both North and

South ends of the terraces.                             I remarked on this to Police Constable

Lamb who was the first officer I met on the track.

I    was    then        joined       by        the    Communications              officer        who    stated          he

understood that radio problems were being experienced.                                                 I informed

him of the trouble I had experienced and elected to walk him around

the    perimeter             track to          the Police          Control       Room.          This   I did,       the
time     being     approximately                2.40     pm.          I    left    the    Communications

Officer at the foot of the stairs leading to the Police Control Box

and     I again      walked     around          the    external           perimeter      of   the   Stadium;

all was       in order;        traffic was light and the number of pedestrians

manageable.

I returned to the perimeter track via the access route between the

Spion    Kop and        the    North       Stand       and     this       time noted that the Spion

Kop had filled up as had the South Stand.                                   There was still seating

available       in the        North    Stand          (approximately          three      quarters     full),

the    West     Stand    had    filled          up,     the    centre       pens    appeared        full   but

there was       still     room visible             at    the       North    and South wings of the

terracing.

I turned to face the Spion Kop, looked at the segregated area which

by     now    contained        well        in    excess        of     500     Liverpool        supporters.

Recognising the potential public disorder problem which could arise

and     already    mentioned          by    Superintendent                Greenwood      at   briefing,      I

signalled to Inspector Calvert who was with a Serial at the side of

the segregated area that I wished to speak with him at the rear of

the North       Stand    in five minutes;                     the time would be approximately

2.50 p m .

I then spoke with             five Liverpool                supporters who were on the Spion

Kop    behind     Gate    6.      As       I did        so     I    saw    Police     Constable       Holmes

escorting       some    Liverpool          supporters          to the       segregated        area in the

Spion    Kop.     I advised           the five youths                 I was   speaking to,          to join

them but      they     ignored me.               (These       youths       were    later taken out of

the Spion Kop and removed from the Stadium for their own safety).

I recall at this time hearing radio transmissions but I was unable

to decipher       the    exact        content         due     to   the     noise    in the     ground and
what     I took          to    be       background           interference.                 This       was    despite      the

fact     that       my    radio was             fitted with            an earpiece.                   I did,       however,

hear the word 'gate1 or'gates'                               mentioned and I                      therefore went to

the     rear        of the           North           Stand     with         a       view to       listening to            the

transmission             as     well         as       discussing         segregation                 problems       on    the

Spion Kop with Inspector Calvert.

On      reaching              the        quieter           area        behind             the     North        Stand,       I

distinctively heard the voice of a male officer.                                                     I would describe

the     tone as excited and urgent and was asking for                                             authority to open

the     'gate'       or 'gates'.                  Terminology was used to the effect                                that if

this was not done,                      then deaths would result.                           The request was made

more     than       once       but        I am       unable       to   say          on    how many          occasions      or

whether by one or more officers.

At     this    time        I    was         joined      by     Inspector             Calvert.           We     agreed      to

double        man    the       cordon           on    the     segregation                area    on    the    Spion       Kop

fifteen minutes after kick off.

I     then    returned             to     the        Spion    Kop      as       I    was    aware       the    game       had

started,        my       attention              being        drawn      by          the    roar        of    the     crowd.

Simultaneously,                I     saw       the     Nottingham               Forest      supporters             pointing

towards        the       West           Stand        and      terracing             and     appeared          angry       and

abusive.            I     did        not     know       at     that      stage            what    had       caused       this

reaction       but       on looking towards the West                                Stand and terracing                  from

the    Spion        Kop        end      I    saw      what     appeared              to    be    a     mass    of    press

officers       in       between          the      Leppings        Lane       end         goal    and    the    terraces.

This bank of people obscured my view of the terracing but I could

see people climbing over the top of the perimeter fencing onto the

track.         I     could          not     see       police      officers               because       of    the    people

behind        the       goal        obscuring           my     view         and      I     recall       my     immediate
impression was that a pitch invasion was taking place.

Radio    transmissions             were        still        poor    and       this,       coupled         with    the

noise of the crowd, made any signals inaudible.

I   immediately           instructed           all    officers          on    the     perimeter           track    to

monitor    the        crowd       on    the        Spion    Kop    as    their       mood       was    angry      and

violent.        I also saw Police Sergeant Batty on the South Wing of the

Spion     Kop    terraces          and         I    signalled       to       him    to     go    over       to    the

segregated       area        to    assist          Inspector       Calvert          and    his    Serial,         the

public disorder potential in that area now being great.

At this juncture police officers came running down the access point

from the        direction         of     the       gymnasium and          I directed            them down the

perimeter       track      in front of the North Stand,                             towards the Leppings

Lane terraces.

The   Spion      Kop      was     now     bubbling,          the    crowd       were       booing,         shouting

abuse and making violent gestures towards the Liverpool supporters.

The     five    Liverpool              supporters          were    removed          via    Gate       6    at     this

point. A minor skirmish occurred but this was quickly brought under

control.

Additional       officers          came        via    the    South Wing            of the       Spion      Kop and

these were allowed onto the perimeter track via Gate 1 and directed

in front of the South Stand to the Leppings Lane end.

I could        see    that      the     number       of     supporters         on the       perimeter            track

was     swelling          behind         the       goal     mouth       and        then    was        aware       that

Superintendent            Greenwood            had    run    onto       the    pitch       and    stopped          the

game .

I recall        Liverpool          supporters          running          over to the         Spion         Kop end,

singularly           at   first,        and        police    officers         moving       forward         to    deal

with them.
The crowd behind the                      goal quickly       swelled onto the pitch and into

the penalty area.                    A St John's Ambulance came down the access road

from the direction of the gymnasium and advertising hoardings were

broken and removed to allow free access onto the pitch.                                               It was

then driven to the Leppings Lane end.

Police    officers          and        supporters          were    together          carrying persons              on

stretchers,          on    advertising              hoardings       and        by    hand     to       the     North

Stand/Spion Kop corner of the pitch and were administering mouth to

mouth    resuscitation                to    some.     It    was    apparent          at     that stage that

there    had        been    deaths,              although    I     am    unable       to     say       how     many.

Supporters          were        also       ripping     down       advertising            hoardings           at   the

Spion Kop end of the Stadium and these in turn were being taken to

the Leppings Lane end.

On    realising       the       potential          enormity        of    the    problem          I ran       to   the

gymnasium and told the officers there to clear the area for use as

a temporary mortuary.

I    returned       to     the       playing       area     and    there       I    saw    Police        Sergeant

Robinson       en    route           to    the    Leppings        Lane    end,       called       him    over      to

assist with First Aid as I knew he was a First Aid Instructor.                                                      I

then turned to another group in time to see them covering a youth's

face     and    stating              he     was     dead.         They     attempted             to     lift      the

advertising hoarding                      he was    on but        one man was            so distressed,            he

walked away and             I took hold of the temporary                            stretcher.          Together

we carried the body to the gymnasium; however, manoeuverability was

limited due to the                   number       of people carrying the                  injured and dead

and therefore             the    dead man's          body was           carried      by four of us into

the    gymnasium.               As    we     carried       the    dead     man      to     the     gymnasium        I

remember urine flowing from the area of the North Stand Upper Level
concourse onto us and officers were sent to deal with the problem.

Once    inside        the     gymnasium           I    was    aware       that    a     number     of     people

(exact      number     not known)             were     laid on the             floor,   apparently dead.

A number of relatives                   and    friends as well               as police officers were

in    the    area,     many       were    distressed,              some were       angry    and directing

insults at the police.                    Detective Sergeant Smith approached me and

stated that officers were not realising the importance of remaining

with    bodies       and     I assigned           him the          duty   of ensuring at least one

officer remained with each body to ensure continuity.

A number of officers were persuading none police personnel to leave

the gymnasium and I returned to the pitch to rejoin officers there.

On my       return    I noticed           that        the    number       of police officers             on the

perimeter       track had been                increased and I spoke with                    some of them,

reminding          them      of     the       need      for        vigilance       in    respect         of     the

Nottingham         Forest         supporters          on     the     Spion      Kop.      Their     mood        was

still angry and abusive and I formed the opinion that the majority

of them did not realise the enormity of what had occurred.

I saw Superintendent Chapman at this end of the ground and I spoke

with him.          He told me            to monitor          the     Nottingham supporters in the

South Stand to ensure                    a pitch invasion did not take place.                                 Extra

men had already been deployed in this area.

A cordon of police officers had been formed across the halfway line

to contain         the Liverpool              supporters.            On satisfying self that all

was    in    order,        I went        to the       halfway         line      cordon.          There were       a

large       number    of     Liverpool          supporters           in    this    area     of    the    pitch,

many    were       distressed,            many        bewildered,          a    large      number        smelled

heavily       of     drink        and    a considerable              amount       of    abuse      was    being

hurled both at the police as well as derogatory remarks being made
about the Football Association.

Slowly      the mood of the             crowd calmed down and Chief                  Superintendent

Nesbit approached me and asked me to take half of the halfway line

cordon      outside      to supervise Nottingham supporters as they left the

Stadium as an announcement was shortly to be made telling the crowd

that the match had been abandoned.

I    took    these       officers       into    Penistone        Road       North,      together       with

Superintendent Chapman.                 That officer organized a cordon across the

dual     carriageway        to     filter       Nottingham        supporters         away    from       the

Liverpool         sector    whilst       I     instructed       Police       Constable      Buxton       to

park    his       Land   Rover     on    the    Central        Reservation        and    I used        that

vehicle's         public address system to advise supporters to turn right

on     leaving       the    ground       for        transport     back       to   Midland       Railway

Station.           The   supporters          were     formed    into     orderly        queues,    buses

were    sent      in batches       to the Catchbar Lane                side of the junction of

Penistone Road North and Herries Road South and were loaded.

When this task was               completed,         I returned to the rear of the North

Stand       and    heard    a    radio       transmission        regarding        fighting        in    the

Hillsborough         Park   area.         I therefore          gathered       ad hoc      Tango    units

together and instructed them to ask Ground Control for a call sign

before being deployed to whatever incident arose.

It was then apparent               that there were a number of officers without

specific       duties      and    these       were     instructed       to    take      seats     in    the

North Stand and await further instructions.                              Officers with keys to

vehicles were identified and were seated separate for deployment if

necessary.           The    officers           were    retained        in    this    area       until     I

received instructions, via Superintendents Mordew and Brookfield to

obtain debrief           sheets     from supervisors in respect of their Serials
and stand the officers down.                          I    would describe the officers in the

North Stand as shocked,                   saddened,          some were distressed and several

openly wept.

On completion of this duty,                       I attended the gymnasium where I found

it    had     been    divided            into    three       areas.      The    first       contained    I

believe       over       80     bodies          and       officers    were     in     the   process     of

recording details of same and taking photographs for identification

purposes under the direction of Inspector Charles.                                    I deputed other

Inspectors to assist him in this task.

The   middle        section         of   the     gymnasium      contained       CID    officers whose

duty it was to see relatives,                         accompany them during identification

and then take statements regarding the same.

The third section had been kept separate for relatives,                                      members of

the Social Services and clergy.

I assisted in the arrangements regarding the identification process

and also counselled/comforted a number of officers.

At    11.00    pm    I   attended          Niagara         Social     Club   and    again    counselled

several       officers        before returning to Hammerton Road Police Station

to    ensure     that         Sub    Divisional            policing    requirements         were   being

catered for.

At 2.30 am on Sunday 16 April 1989, I went off duty.

Chief Inspector

South Yorkshire Police



The Operational Order for the 1989 Semi Pinal like all Orders for

league games comprises general instructions to all police

personnel and specific instructions to individual officers.

Dependant upon the duty which is required to be performed,

officers are grouped into Serials of 1 Sergeant and either 5, 8 or

10 Constables.        Each Serial is allocated a number and, in the case

of the 1989 Semi Pinal, these were numbered 1-64 inclusive.

Details of individual officers making up a Serial are typed

alongside instructions regarding the duties to be performed by

them during the three phases of the operation and this is termed a

'Serial Or d e r '.

Again, dependant on the nature of the duties to be performed by a

particular Serial, the Serials are grouped together and an

Inspector put in overall command of that group of Serials.

Once the Operational Order has been approved, the information

contained therein is circulated as follows:

(a)       Chief Inspector and above receive a copy of the entire

          Order

(b)       Inspectors in charge of Serials receive a copy of the

          Serial Orders relative to the officers under their

          command, together with a precis of the important points
contained in the general instructions.   A copy of such a

document is attached hereto.

Sergeants receive a copy of their respective Serial Order

with an instruction to contact each officer individually,

meet them collectively prior to briefing and take up seats

in the North Stand as a Serial ready for pre-match

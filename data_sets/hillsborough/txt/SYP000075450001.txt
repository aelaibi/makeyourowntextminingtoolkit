           On Saturday 15t*h April 1989 (150489), I attended the semi-final at
                               ^  ------------------
           ^Hillsborough. I am a Liverpool supporter.   I travelled to the Ground

            with a group of friends.

            I am a season ticket holder, and obtained my ticket from Anfield.                               I

            paid £6.00 for the ticket which was for the. Leppings Ln,                      st and in g,a r e a ,
                                                                 a n/ rtO
           71 travelled to the game with four friends,

                            I used my own car.

            I travelled straight to the Ground without stopping.                        The only delay

           we suffered was due to the volume of traffic,                 using the Pennine Way
                                                                                   PAGE      2
                                                                                   S 1 971

All of us went       inside'Yt^e hotel and had a couple of pints in total.

We left ti\„ r__                      _pm (1430 hrs) to make         our way down to

the Ground.

En route, actually walking down to the Ground,               I did not see any

Police Officers to give us dilN?ctians or escort.                  No-one was fighting

or causing trouble in any Wcjty-^ I ^StV rived at the entrance to the

Ground at abt^ut       2.40 pm ( 144Q hrs) . S 3 < E

There was no org^fAised q u e u e ; :Lt was just a masis of           people.   They were

all    pushing and     shoving.    The only Police Officers I saw we r e two

mounted Officers.        These Officers were trying to get the fans into

some order.     Whilst    I was   in the crowd,      I saw a large blue gate being

opened.     About forty fans were allowed through and the gates were shut

behind them again.        This happened at least twice.             I was unable to see

who opened the gate.         I w a s n ’t able to see if anyone       inside was

checking th«L tickets of the fans being allowed in.                  This gate was to

the right of entVagfice           which I was trying to enter through.               I did

not see any stewards outsidK the turnstiles

I was unable to find my way to my entry point into the Ground due to

the crowd.     I was just stuck in\the crowd,            getting    pushed and shoved

and not getting any closer to the \urnstile.

Eventually this same gate I saw opened earlier, was again opened.

This time the gate was        pulled right open and a H ^ w e d       the crowd to

surge    in through the open gate.         Whereas on the previous occasions the

gates had been shut behind a few           fans,   this time the gates       remained

open.     I saw no attempt to close        them.       All the crowd were allowed to

enter.     No-one asked to see my ticket for the game.                No-one tried to

stop me going    in through the gate.         I was just pushed through with the

crowd.    My ticket was just       in my   trouser     pocket, and I still      possess

the whole ticket, No's LL2 52 14.

I was just carried with the crowd.  The crowd entered the tunnel

saw the players on the pitch.           Although theNtunnel was totally packed,

we\ were allowed free passage along           it.     I saw^ no Police Officers or

stewards at this point         in the Ground.        I saw no fans fighting or

causing trouble,      or either drinking.           Before we entered the tunnel we

all decided we'd get to the left of the terraces.                      I still   remained

with my friends as we went along the tunnel.

As we entered the terraces          I tried to push left to go to where I

wanted to stand.       My two friends were able to do this but I was just

pushed down into the t e r r a c e s . X I   wasn't able to stand to choose where

to go,    I didn't have time to even\lo this.               As I was pushed down the

turned to see him backwards against a barrier,                     in obvious pain.           I

wasn't able to go to help him,            I was just pushed down the terraces

towards the fence.        I was eventually pushed right down the terraces to

the front fencing.        I was    pushed up against the fencing.                I could see

a small gate onto the pitch slightly to my right.                      I ended up in Pen

I would have got in\o rhe terraces at about g.55 pm (1455 h r s ).                        The

crush in the terraces       remained constant.           I was aware that the game

had started but I wasn't          paying much attention to the game.                The crush

was so bad it was making breathing difficult.                      I was. in some

discomfort.        I hadn't a clue who I was stood with,               I'd tost all my

    riends by this time.       No-one    in the crowd was fighting or causing

trouble, people were too busy trying to stay on their feet.

All the crowd were screaming            in panic and pain.           I had my hands up

against my head,      unable to move them in any way.                 A man right next to

me,   slightly behind me, was        in some distress.             He was shouting he Was

dying,   he couldn't breathe.         His arms were          in the air,    flapping all

over the place.       I couldn't see this chap,              couldn't even turn my head

to look at him.       His head was about my chest height;              he was obviously

in a difficult    position to breathe.               I d o n ’t know what happened to

this man.    Whilst    I was   in the crush I was screaming at a Liverpool

fan who was on the pitch to stop the game.                   By this time,     fans were
                  CfTT •
climbing over the fencing onto the pitch.                    I also spoke to a young

Policeman.     I asked him to get wire cutters to let us out.                    He tried

to calm me down,      saying there was space at the back.                  Trying to cairn

us,    saying the pressure would be relieved soon.                 Also a chap in the

crush, a lot bigger than me, was trying to calm me down,                      saying not to

panic,    to breathe slowly.        I really didn't think I could hold on much

more,    the crush was so bad.        At one point the crush did get worse,

which made    it even more uncomfortable and painful.                 I d o n ’t know what

caused this.

I could see a small gate onto the pitch to my right.                       I tried to get

ta^the gate,    but I jus^ couldn't move to reach it.                 Eventually this

gate opened and^ initially^>eople were only slowly getting o u t .                    This

was because the gate was so small.                  As soon as the gate was opened,

people were panicking,         trying to get out through it.               People were

stood on top of others,        trying to get through the gate or over the

fencing.     I d i d n ’t see anyone get      injured or killed.           But I ’m sure

that    people were either     crushed to death or badly injured in the crush

to get out of this gate,         it w a ^ t h a t    bad.

The pressure eased off, my hands became free.                    I tried a couple

times to pull myself up ov^kr the fencing,                  but I was stuck.     Eventually

my legs came free and I fuelled myself up                   the fencing.

I was then assisted^ky a Policeman and a fan who grabbed

my wrists aiid pulled mt^oVer the fencing onto the pitch.                      I did not

assist anyone who was dead or injured.                  I was exhausted and I was just

       treated by a St. Joh^s Ambulance                person who made sure I was alright.

       I then got up and wandered around,                looking for my friends.     I found my

       friend                              , but I wasn't able to find

       I then spoke to a Policeman on the halfway line.                   We asked him about

       our friend.       He asked us to go into the gymnasium and check he wasn't

       in therl

       I then w e n N i n t o   the gym, w here I\ a w      a lot of bodies on the fl o o r .

    Vp All their heads were covered by clothMig or something else.                      I just

^    f^broke down at this sight.              A doctor asked me to hold a fan who was

       very bad.      He just told me to hold his head still,              not to go onto his

       back.    He kept asking for water.               I held his head for a short while

       until another doctor             came along.

                 couldn't find my other friend, iTts^we left the gym and\went back

       pnto the pi t ch .       We walked back to the Leppings Ln end, where                  found

                  who was alright.
                                                                   i/i n i\)<oy .
       At about 4.2Q^pm          (1620 h r s ? , I heard \ y loud speaker ann oun ce me n t,

       saying the game
                   i m e ^ll^s
                           l cancelled.              At tl^Ns^we left   the Ground and made

       our way back to          the car.

       I would like to          say    that the Police    Officers on the touchline      didn't.

       seem to realise          what was happening.        Because of this,   I think    this

       caused the delay in get                    the gates at the front open.     Without a

       doubt    it was far more serious th^n they thought,               when dead and injured

      were bought onto the pitch.                 The Poi!b-Qe were not organised.      The

      Police just left the Liverpool                 fans to treat the dead and injured.

      Police Officers were helping,                 but there just seemed to be that delay

       in them reacting to what was happening.

       Initially when some fans got onto the pitch they became upset at

      Notts.    Forest fans           chanting,   only because they didn't know what was

       happening.      Liverpool         fans began running down towards them;        I thought
                                                                                    PAGE       6

         ♦then there would be trouble.       I tried to stop some of them.      A few

         Policemen chased fansSback towards the Leppings Ln end. Then a line of

         some 100 Policemen formetf a line across the pitch to prevent trouble.

         However by this time      it was obvious that there was not trouble but

         people dying and being      injured.      These Police Officers just stayed in

         a line.     They should have been used to either help the fans,           in either

         pulling the fencing down or treatiria people.           It seemed a waste to

         have so many men vstood 4°i-n9 nothing,\when people were dying,

         Last year    I attended the yame.      It was much better or gan ise d.    Police

         Officers were stopping fans,       checking tickets and sending      people away

         without tickets.      These Officers were       in a cordon, which had the

         effect of controlling the flow of fans through to the turnstiles.

         There were no queues      last year, as we entered the Ground at the same

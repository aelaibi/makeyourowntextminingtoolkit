was    not      specific as          to w hi c h     gates      he thought             should be opened              but

his a n x i e t y was apparent.                     It confirmed my              perception,           unprecedented

in my     experience,             that     this was      no o r d i n a r y      crowd of fans            but an

enormous          press     of    people        determined        to enter          the      stadium     come what

may.         I was,       nevertheless,             unhappy       to agree          to the      requests        to

implemen t         it w o u l d     lead to uncontrol led acc e s s                     to the stadium and

negate all          our     efforts        to    prevent       hooliganism             inside.         I told him

that     we w o u l d have          to hang        on.     He     res p o n d e d      by saying       that unless

gates     were      opened        people w o u l d be          crushed.             The      look of extreme

anxiety         remained on his              face.        I took a c c o u n t          of the fact         that      this

was an       Inspector           s p e aking     to me and        I made my mind up im m e d i a t e l y

that     the      only    practical          way    to   prevent        deaths         outside w ould         be to

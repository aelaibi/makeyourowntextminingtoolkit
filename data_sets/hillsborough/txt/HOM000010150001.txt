 Dear                      .   $ IT v u x u   .

HILLSBOROUGH

 I am following up a matter raised with you earlier this year by David Blunkett MP. He
wrote in the context of the private criminal prosecutions brought by the HFSG, and the
South Yorkshire Police Authority’s decision that, given the circumstances of this incident,
it should properly meet the defence costs of the two former officers out of Police Authority
funds. He suggested that there might be a case for Home Office to provide funding to
support the Authority’s costs.

The Authority’s present decision to fund was restricted to the proceedings up to committal
stage - July 1999. In view of the outcome, I envisage that the Authority will receive within
the next month or so a further application for the two former officers to fund the defence
costs for the trial itself, which is scheduled for June 2000.

The case has implications extending beyond South Yorkshire. This was a central issue in
the Judicial Review earlier this year which established that Police Authorities do have the
necessary powers. The morale of the South Yorkshire force is at stake. However, as
Chief Constable Mike Hedges has said publicly, it is vital that all police officers know,
when they are faced with split second decisions to make in pressured circumstances, that
their Police Authority will stand behind them and provide support if they act in good faith
but things go wrong, as happened in April 1989.

While the Authority was unanimous in its decision to support the officers in the committal
proceedings, it was at the same time mindful of the financial implications. Expenditure to
date has been met from reserves, but ultimately the costs will impact directly on policing
budgets or indirectly through the need to reinstate reserves.

The Authority s budgets are also being squeezed by Hillsborough costs from another
direction. The public liability insurance limit of £8.5m was reached many years ago, but
there remains a number of outstanding claims. So far the Authority has set aside in its
accounts nearly £5m for additional liabilities which are likely to arise when claims are
settled. Recently, our insurance advisers have informed us of reassessment of life
expectancies for two permanently incapacitated victims. These cases alone will require
the Authority to set aside a further £2.6m to meet potential liabilities. If this is raised via
the precept it could add around 13% to Council Tax.

I have given you the broad background to our situation. My purpose in writing personally
to you is to request a meeting with Home Office to discuss an application from this
Authority for financial support towards the costs it is facing on Hillsborough related
matters.

On hearing from you, I will arrange for a more detailed paper to be prepared by the Clerk
and Treasurer and the Chief Constable.

Yours sincerely




Clarence Swindell
Chair, South Yorkshire Police Authority

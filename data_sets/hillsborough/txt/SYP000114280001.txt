                       We    stopped as many of              these    fans as we           could arid they either           left

T here       were          some       wh o    managed             to     get       past      us    still          with       the i r

fans        w e re     less          willing          to     be    d ir ect ed and                they were             fcoistrous.

Although              not       especially              agressive              they         seemed          int en t      on    getting           to

Whilst           at    this          location           three          coaches          stopped             at    the     side      of      the

About        this          t im e     we     were       directed              by    fans      who       w e re     stil l       streaming

group        of L i v e r p o o l            supporters                had m an a g e d           to    gain access              and

             cown     from        the     stand          above        us.     Whilst          t n is       was       happening              we   had     to

             prevent         people           coming          onto     the    terraces             from         the       tunnel        they      were

             trying         to    force        their          way     past    us.        These         peo p le           were        displaying

             anger      towaras           police          officers           again       blaming            us       for      what      had

             happened,,               Borne of         these        people        were     obviously                 genuinely              distressed

 Paraded for duty at Doncaster DHQ then transported to Hillsborough by coach.
 After briefing at Hillsborough took up duty on Claywhiaels Lane supervising the
 arrival by coach of Liverpool Supporters. The atmosphere at this time was good,
 most coaches appeared to contain an assortment of spectators, men, women and
 children who were well behaved and in good humour.
 l/hen parking spaces on Claywheeis Lane were full, I went v.dth other officers to
 the end of Claywheeis Lane to its junction with Penistone/Salifax Hoad.
    now the time would have been approx 2 .50pm*
 There were large numbers of Liverpool supporters walking from Halifax Road towards
 the ground. The pavementson both sides of the road were 5 or 6 deep with flans a large
 proportion of whom     25 -30/;’ vwee drinking beer from cans as they walked,
 l.'e stopped as many of these fans as we eould and they either left their drink at the
 side of the road, or stopped and drank it. There were some who managed to §et past
 us still with their drink. The atmosphere at this time was not as good as before,
 the fans were less willing to be directed and they were boistrous. Although not
 especially agressive they seemed intent on getting to the ground and did not want
 to be directed.
 v/hilst at this location three coaches stopped at the side of the road, and the passengers,
 who were liverpool fans attempted to get of:?. Some managed to get off but the others
 were prevented and directed to the coach perking area on Halifax Road. These fans
 did not want to listen to advice and were abrasive*
 About this time we were directed by fans who were still streaming down Halifax Hoad,
 to The Gate Public House. The pub was closed and at the back entrance were 5-6 Liverpool
 fans kicking at the door to get in. They were moved away and eventually we gained access
 to the pub. Inside it was packed with local Sheffield people who were drinking*
 According to these people, a small group of Liverpoll supporters had magaged to gain
 acdess and fighting had started. There were broken pool cues and broken glasses
 littering the floor.
 I recall remarking to other officers at this time that there was no way that the
 fans still streaming down Halifax Hoad would get to the game in time. 3y now the time
 would have been about J-pm,
 The volume of supporters lessened considerably and we were about to go for our meal
 when we were directed to the Leppings Lane end of the ground where there was trouble
 of some sort.
 Whilst on Halifax/Penistone Hoad, I saw groups of fans walking back from the direction
 of the ground, they were Liverpool fans and were stopping other fans asking for spare
 tickets, it was obvious they did not have tickets for the match*
 On reaching the Leppings Lane end of the ground, we were formed up into our serials
 outside the ground. At this time there were still large numbers of Liverpool fans
 outside the ground some were starting to make their way away from the ground*
                                                                    t i C5
We entered the ground through a c oncer tin?, steel -jgte which was opened for us by   ..
police officers (possibly the gates were slightly ajar ;.dth officers on duty at the*
gates)
Inside the ground there were a number of people (not great) milling around in a yard,
area behind the stand. In line with the steel gates was a tunnel under the stand
leading to the terraces. At the outside end of the tunnel there were several bodies
lying on the ground. There were injured people also lying on the ground. These people
were being tended to by police officers , spectators and I think St John ambulance
per .sonel or similar. I made my way through the tunnel onto the terraces. There were
injured people lying on the ground with fans milling around them. I assisted some injures
people through the tunnel to the yard at the rear. There were many bodies and injured
people on the terraces close to the perimeter fence. These people were being tended to
by police officers and spectators. There was a large number of spectators on the
pitch just on the other side of the fence. I could see injured people and bodies
being passed over the fence and through a gap in it. There were police officers and
spectators trying to break dovm. the fence to gain a.ccess to the terraces.
I assisted in removing several injured people from the terraces to the tunnel and into
the yard. This was extremely difficult we had to force our way through the crowd to
reach injured people end then force our way back. Whilst on the terraces the crowd on
the stand above us were shouting and jeering insults at the police. Many of them were
spitting dovm onto the people below. The noise wac deafening, it wan almost impossible
to hear what a person next to you was saying. The stench of stale beer and faeces
was strong. It was obvious that the police were being blamed for what had happened,
at times I was concerned for my own and other peoples safety, I thought we would be
overrun by the crowd. People 'v/EEe climbing both up and down from the stand above us.
Whilst this was happening we had to prevent people coming onto the terraces from
the tunnel they were trying to force their way past us. These people were displaying
anger towards police officers again blaming us for what had happehed. Some of these
people were obviously genuinly distressed and were trying to find frieds and realatives
they had lost conta,ct with.
At some point during this time I was handed a wristwatch, I dont know who by. I took
possession of it and later noted that the watch, which -was still fastened, had
stopped at 2.53pn.
Svetually the terraces were cleared of the injured and dead, I was then directed
to the yard at the rear of the stand to direct supporters leaving the ground.
  -Mhen
    -   supervised Liverpool fans making their was back to Clay;;heels Lane to their
coaches.
1 do recall hearing before we made our way to the ground several radio messages on
other officer's radios. Two of these I can remember clearly
1/ For christs sake open the gates, yes open the gates
2/ There are people dying In here
I can't remember in what order I hearded these messages, I don't know who ssid them.

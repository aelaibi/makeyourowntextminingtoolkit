                I've been a Managing D i r e ctor of                                                             tfhi ch

                I live at the above address with my wife and have one son who lives in

                                    with an additional          daughter who      lives in

                I would describe myself as an active football                            supporter with Leeds

               United watching them at grounds all over the country and abroad for

                the past 20 years.               Also      I've been a member of the Leeds United               '100

               Club'        for the past        10-15 years.         This basically entitles me to access

                to the directors box lounges at the ground with the club as well as

                special match day facilities.                     For big away games such as          cup games

               and some internationals.                     I've got access to tickets through the               '100
                                                                      PAGE        2
                                                                      SI 750

Club'.   Although the seat entitlement for the     '100 Club'    is next to

the directors box area I am not personally involved with Leeds United

Football Club.

On 12th April    1987 (120487)   I attended Hillsborough Stadium,
          -------- f--------------
Sheffield, to watch Coventry City v Leeds United in the F .A .

Cup Semi Final.     I sat Y * ^the North Stand by the    West End. The thing

that sticks out in my mind about that game was that the police were

checking supporters for possession of tickets a long way from the

ground in a filter type system.      Also my club, Leeds United,    expressed

that ticket holders should only travel      to the game on the day.      People

weren't being allowed to get on coaches without tickets.         From what I

could see there was no trouble at the ground.

In early 1989 I also attended the       City Ground in Nottingham when

Nottingham Forest were playing Leeds.       Supporters   could only obtain a

ticket for the tie if they possessed an identity card endorsed and

carrying a   photograph of themselves.     Likewise entry to the City

Ground was   only allowed on display of the same identity card with the

match day ticket.     Again this game went off quite well.

I think that if the supporters were checked for tickets and drunkeness

etc on the   way to the ground the crowd problem would be stemmed at        the

source and   proper viewing of the sport would not be impaired.

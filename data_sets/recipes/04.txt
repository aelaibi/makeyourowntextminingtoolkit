4 vine-ripened tomatoes
half a cucumber
1 bunch spring onions
, sliced
2 x 20g packs fresh parsley
grated zest of a lemon
6 tbsp olive oil
2 tbsp lemon juice

Prepare the couscous: Put the couscous into a large bowl. Pour over the boiling water or stock and stir. Cover with a plate or cling film and leave to stand for 5 mins until all the liquid has been absorbed. Separate the grains by roughing them up with a fork.

Whisk the olive oil, lemon juice and the garlic with plenty of seasoning and drizzle over the couscous. Toss well and serve with some grilled fish, meat or chicken.

Rustic bread

Ingredients

250g strong white bread flour
1 tsp fast-action dried yeast
1 tbsp olive oil
, plus extra for drizzling
200ml sparkling water
semolina
, for sprinkling (optional)
finely chopped rosemary
 and Maldon salt, for sprinklng

Method

Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Mix together the flour, yeast and 1/2 tsp salt. Add the oil, then pour in the water gradually, adding enough to make a soft dough. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 4-5 mins until the dough feels strong, bouncy and has a silky feel to it.
Cut the dough into 8 pieces, then roll out into rough rounds about 16-17cm in diameter. (Donâ€™t pile them on top of each other or they will stick together.)
Sprinkle a baking sheet or two with semolina if you have it, otherwise leave plain. Lay the breads on the sheets and let them sit for 5 mins, then scatter with rosemary, salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in batches for 8-10 mins until puffy and golden. Can be made 3-4 hrs ahead.

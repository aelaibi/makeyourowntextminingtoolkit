Red onion & chilli bhajis with mint & garlic raita

Ingredients

2 red onions
100g chickpea flour
 (gram flour)
Â½ tsp baking powder
2 tsp curry paste or powder
1 red or green chilli
, deseeded and finely chopped
vegetable oil, for frying
For the raita
150g tub natural yogurt
2 tbsp chopped mint
1 small garlic clove, crushed

Method

Finely chop one onion and thinly slice the other. Sift the flour and baking powder into a bowl. Add the curry paste or powder, chopped chilli and a good sprinkling of salt. Add about 150ml of cold water to make a thick batter. Stir in the chopped and sliced onions until they are well coated.
Mix together the raita ingredients with a little salt and pepper, then spoon into a small bowl. Heat about 5cm of oil in a wok or deep pan. Add a tiny speck of batter, if it rises to the surface surrounded by bubbles and starts to brown, then the oil is hot enough.
Add heaped tbsps of onion mix to the pan, a few at a time, and cook for a few mins, turning once, until they are evenly browned and crisp, about 3-4 mins. Drain on kitchen paper, sprinkle with a little salt and keep warm while you cook the remaining bhajis. Serve with the raita.

Spicy Indian rice

Ingredients

a mugful of American long grain rice
2 onions
, sliced
2 tbsp sunflower oil
Â½ tsp turmeric
1 cinnamon stick
6 cardamom pods
1 tsp cumin seeds
large handful of sultanas and roasted cashew nuts

Method

Fry the onions in the sunflower oil in a large frying pan for 10-12 minutes until golden.
Fill a roomy saucepan with water, bring to the boil and tip in a heaped teaspoon of salt - the water will bubble furiously. Add turmeric and the cinnamon stick to the water. Pour in the rice, stir once and return to the boil, then turn the heat down a little so that the water is boiling steadily, but not vigorously. Boil uncovered, without stirring (this makes for sticky rice) for 10 minutes. Lift some out with a slotted spoon and nibble a grain or two. If they're too crunchy, cook for another minute and taste again. They should be tender but with a little bite. Drain the rice into a large sieve and rinse by pouring over a kettle of very hot water
Stir the crushed seeds of the cardamom pods into the onions with the cumin seeds and fry briefly.
Toss in a large handful of sultanas and roasted cashew nuts, then the hot drained rice. This is great with curry and will also give an exotic edge to grilled meat or fish.

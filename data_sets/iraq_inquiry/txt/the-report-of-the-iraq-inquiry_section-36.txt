The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Introduction and key findings
1.  This Section addresses the development of UK strategy on Iraq between the adoption
of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 (see Section 3.5) and Mr Blair’s meeting with
President Bush, in Washington, on 31 January 2003.
2.  Other key developments in the UK’s thinking between mid‑November and the end
of January which had an impact on the strategy and the planning and preparation for
military action are addressed elsewhere in the report:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The Joint Intelligence Committee’s (JIC) Assessments of Iraq’s declaration
of 7 December 2002, and its view that there was a continuing policy of
concealment and deception in relation to its chemical, biological, nuclear and
ballistic missile programmes, are addressed in Section 4.3.
How advice was sought from Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, regarding
the interpretation of UN Security Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the manner
in which that advice was provided is addressed in Section 5.
The development of the options to deploy ground forces and the decision on
17 January to deploy a large scale land force for potential operations in southern
Iraq rather than for operations in northern Iraq, as well as maritime and air
forces, are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.
UK planning and preparations for a post‑Saddam Hussein Iraq are addressed in
Sections 6.4 and 6.5.

Key findings
•	

Following the adoption of resolution 1441, the UK was pursuing a strategy of
coercive diplomacy to secure the disarmament of Iraq. The hope was that this
might be achieved by peaceful means, but views differed on how likely that would
be.

•	

The UK Government remained convinced that Iraq had retained prohibited
weapons and was pursuing chemical, biological and ballistic missile programmes
in contravention of its obligations to disarm; and that the absence of evidence of
weapons and programmes was the result of a successful policy of concealment.

•	

By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that Iraq had had “no change of
heart” and military action to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime was likely to be
required to disarm Iraq.

•	
•	

The US Administration was planning military action no later than early March.
Mr Blair and Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, concluded that a second
UN (United Nations) resolution would be essential to secure domestic and
international support for military action. In the absence of a “smoking gun”, that
would require more time and a series of reports from the UN inspectors which
established a pattern of Iraqi non‑compliance with its obligations.

•	

Mr Blair secured President Bush’s support for a second resolution but did not
secure agreement that the inspections process should continue until the end of
March or early April. That left little time for the inspections process to provide
the evidence that would be needed to achieve international agreement on the
way ahead.

The response to resolution 1441
Iraq’s response
3.  Iraq announced on 13 November 2002 that it would comply with
resolution 1441.
4.  Iraq challenged US and UK claims, including the UK statement that it had
decided to keep possession of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and
restated its position that it had neither produced nor was in possession of
weapons of mass destruction.
5.  Iraq informed the Security Council of its decision to comply with resolution 1441
(2002), without conditions, in a letter from Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, to
Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary‑General, on 13 November 2002.1
6.  The letter stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The claims by President Bush and Mr Blair that “Iraq might have produced, or
might have been on the way to producing, nuclear weapons” since 1998 and
that “Iraq had indeed produced chemical and biological weapons” was “an utterly
unfounded fabrication” and “baseless”.
Iraq had agreed to the return of the inspectors, and had “already stated” that
it had “neither produced nor possessed any nuclear, chemical or biological,
weapons of mass destruction during the absence of the inspectors”.
Iraq would “deal with resolution 1441, despite its iniquitous contents”. It was
“ready to receive the inspectors so that they can perform their duties, and
ascertain that Iraq has produced no weapons of mass destruction during their
absence”.
Iraq was “eager for them to accomplish their task in accordance with
international law as soon as possible”. If they did so “in a professional and
lawful manner” the (US and UK) “liars” would be “revealed to the public and the
declared aim of the Security Council will be achieved”.
The Security Council would be “under obligation” by “the public and the law
to apply paragraph 14 of … resolution … 687, by applying it to … (Israel), and

UN Security Council, 13 November 2002, ‘Letter dated 13 November 2002 from the Minister for Foreign
Affairs of Iraq addressed to the Secretary‑General’ (S/2002/1242).

thereafter to the entire region of the Middle East … so that it is free of mass
destruction weapons”.
7.  The letter challenged a statement made by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent
Representative to the United Nations in New York, that Iraq had been provided with
the opportunity to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction, but Iraq had ignored
that opportunity and decided to keep possession. The letter asked why “none of
the representatives” of the members of the Security Council had “asked … when,
how or where such an alleged decision had been taken by Iraq to keep weapons of
mass destruction”.
8.  Iraq referred to the American Administration having exerted pressure and threatened
to leave the UN if it did not agree to what America wanted; and that America threatened
to perpetrate “aggression”. Iraq feared that the United Nations may “lose the trust and
interest of peoples”. “All those” who were concerned about the organisation were “called
upon to exercise caution and act in accordance with international law and the Charter of
the United Nations”.
9.  Iraq appealed to Mr Annan to ensure that those implementing the resolution did not:
“… push the situation to the edge of the precipice … because the people of Iraq
will not choose to live if the price is their dignity, homeland, their freedom or things
sacrosanct to them. On the contrary, the price will be their lives if that is the only way
forward to preserve what must be preserved.”
10.  The UK remained sceptical about Iraq’s intentions, focusing on its track
record of deceit and deception, and repeating the need to maintain the threat
of military action to secure compliance.
11.  In a lecture that evening, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, welcomed Iraq’s
response “so far as it goes” but added:
“… we must remain vigilant for experience with Iraq tells us to temper optimism with
scepticism and to read the small print. Iraq’s intentions are notoriously changeable.
What matters above all is their actions not their words.
“… The history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq is littered with examples of
deceit, evasion, intimidation and harassment. I hope even Iraq will recognise the
consequences of any repeat. If Saddam fails to co‑operate fully, then he faces force.
“UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution] 1441 sets out the pathway to peace.
Those of us who negotiated the text were determined to ensure that it was
not a set of traps for Iraq … But we must be clear: he will not comply unless he
is sure that the international community has another route to disarmament – the
military route …”2

12.  Mr Blair used an interview with the Arabic Service of Radio Monte Carlo on
14 November to send a message to Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi people and the Arab
world that it was Saddam Hussein’s fault that the people of Iraq were not enjoying real
wealth and prosperity.3 He declared that the objective of the United Nations resolution
was disarmament not regime change.
13.  Mr Blair emphasised that Saddam Hussein’s duty was to co‑operate fully with the
inspectors by providing an “honest declaration [of Iraq’s proscribed capabilities]” and
then to co‑operate in eradicating them. Mr Blair added that if Saddam did not disarm the
consequence would be that he would be “disarmed by force”. The choice for Saddam
Hussein was “very, very clear”.
14.  Mr Blair also stated that weapons of mass destruction and terrorism were two
separate, but linked issues that had to be dealt with:
“… if we allow countries which have got repressive and brutal regimes to develop
these weapons, at some point they will use them, and that is why we have got to
take the action.”

Cabinet, 14 November 2002
15.  Mr Straw told Cabinet on 14 November that while the Security Council
would need to be reconvened to discuss any breach in the event of Iraqi
non‑compliance, the key aspect of resolution 1441 was that military action could
be taken without a further resolution.
16.  Mr Straw told Cabinet on 14 November that Iraq was required to accept the terms
of resolution 1441 by the end of that week. Iraq had sent the UN a tirade of abuse but
the response was nevertheless positive.4 The requirement for Iraq to make a declaration
of its holdings of weapons of mass destruction and the facilities for developing
such weapons was more important. The new inspection regime would start work by
23 December.
17.  Mr Straw stated that a “key aspect of the resolution was that there was no
requirement for a second resolution before action was taken against Iraq in the event
of its non‑compliance, although reconvening the Security Council to discuss any breach
was clearly stated”.
18.  Mr Blair concluded that “the Iraq regime was under pressure and the leadership was
concerned about the reliability of internal support”.
19.  The issue of whether assurances to Cabinet that military action could be taken
without a further resolution accurately reflected the position of Lord Goldsmith at that
time is addressed in Section 5.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

UK assumptions about Iraq’s position
JIC ASSESSMENT, 14 NOVEMBER 2002: ‘IRAQ: REGIME COHESION
UNDER PRESSURE’
20.  In mid‑November, the Joint Intelligence Committee reviewed its July 2002
Assessment of regime cohesion in Iraq.
21.  The JIC judged that Iraq had accepted resolution 1441 to avert a large‑scale
US‑led ground attack and it would focus on concealing sensitive items from the
inspectors.
22.  If Saddam Hussein believed a large‑scale attack was inevitable, he would
probably cease co‑operation and become far more confrontational.
23.  In parallel with the adoption of resolution 1441, the JIC decided to revisit its July
2002 assessment of regime cohesion in Iraq to:
“… examine how the Iraqi regime is responding to mounting international
pressure … [and] assess whether there are any signs of strain within the regime and
evaluate the speed and effectiveness of Iraqi decision‑making.”5
24.  In the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment on 13 November, three key points
were made:

•	
•	

•	

The draft Key Judgement that the cracks in the Iraqi regime had not widened
since the last Assessment was correct.
Concealment and the retention of a WMD capability “remained a cornerstone of
Saddam’s policy” and his intention was to allow the inspectors in and “manage”
the inspections indefinitely as a means of avoiding conflict. But the resolution
put the onus on Iraq to prove it had no WMD programmes. The inspectors
would need to be prepared to deal with diversionary tactics including lengthy
inspections of sites not related to WMD. The UN Monitoring, Verification and
Inspections Commission (UNMOVIC) would “eventually” bring pressure to bear
on Saddam Hussein, “causing further cracks in the regime”.
The Assessment should address the extent to which cracks might widen, the
role of regime members and how concerns about their personal survival might
affect their support for Iraq’s WMD policy.6

25.  The Key Judgements of the JIC were:
“•	 Iraq accepted UNSCR 1441 because Saddam knew this was the only way to
avert a large‑scale US‑led Coalition ground attack. The regime probably believes
that a Coalition attack will not be possible when inspectors are inside Iraq.

Iraq could try to overload UNMOVIC by releasing large volumes of information
about legitimate industries. Although less likely, Iraq might admit to some
‘expendable’ parts of its WMD programmes to demonstrate ostensible
co‑operation and to provoke divisions in the UN. But it will focus on concealing
sensitive items from inspectors.
There is no real evidence as yet of real cracks within the regime, but these might
appear if UNMOVIC makes real progress. But loyalty within the Iraq military or
security apparatus is unlikely to collapse until an overwhelming Coalition attack
is seen as inevitable or actually begins. And regime breakdown cannot be
guaranteed short of a major ground invasion.
If Saddam were to perceive a large‑scale Coalition attack to be inevitable, he
would probably cease any co‑operation with the UN and become far more
confrontational.
Saddam’s total control means that Iraqi policy can change substantially with
little warning. There is considerable scope for Saddam to miscalculate or
react unpredictably.”7

26.  Other important points made in the Assessment were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

7 

The agreement of “new, tougher rights for inspectors” in resolution 1441 had
been “an unwelcome surprise to the Iraqi leadership”.
“Regime survival” was Saddam Hussein’s “overriding priority”. But he also “had
a very strong commitment to retaining WMD” which he saw as “key to Iraq’s
power and influence”.
Iraq’s security apparatus was “designed to prevent internal rebellion”.
Top officials already associated “their fate with that of the regime, fearing
retribution from the Iraqi population, or the Coalition”.
Regime concerns about internal security were “focused on southern Iraq” but the
JIC continued to judge that “an internal uprising would be unable to overthrow
Saddam except in conjunction with a large‑scale external attack”.
Iraq had “no credible alternative to ostensible co‑operation with the UN” and it
could “only continue playing for time in the hope that the international pressure
it faces eventually weakens”. Saddam Hussein would “avoid extreme actions,
at least in the short term”.
The JIC had “no new intelligence” on whether Iraq would “declare any
prohibited materials or activity in response” to resolution 1441. Any disclosures
on WMD would “damage the regime’s already limited credibility, given its
continuing blanket denials of WMD possession”. The Iraqi regime would “seek
to take advantage of any opportunity to fudge Iraq’s obligations or delay the
UN process”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

“Senior Iraqis” agreed “that Iraq should maintain a WMD capability”, but if
UNMOVIC made “demonstrable progress which threatens to overcome Iraq’s
policy of deception and concealment, and Saddam refuses to give ground, there
could be pressure on key insiders to break with Saddam in order to ensure their
own survival”.

PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN
27.  Following Mr Blair’s discussion with President Bush on 6 November (see
Section 3.5), No.10 commissioned a psychological profile of Saddam Hussein, “not least
for the pointers this may give on splitting off Saddam from his regime”.8
28.  On 14 November, the Private Secretary to Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of the
Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), sent Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC, a draft
psychological profile of Saddam Hussein, based on a Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS)
document produced in late 2001.9
29.  The key points identified in the profile included:
“•	 Personal survival, survival of the regime, and Iraqi‑led Arab unity are the three
most powerful factors that motivate Saddam …

•	
•	
•	

He thinks strategically and will operate tactically. He is a judicious political
calculator …
His propensity to take risks coupled with vigilance and a task‑oriented approach
to problems has led to generally judicious decision making. However, his
tendency to seek and filter information to support his beliefs has created a
skewed appreciation of any risks he may take …
The result is perpetuation of a deeply entrenched belief that the intention of
outsiders is unjust and it is they who are responsible for the ills in Iraq …”

30.  The profile stated that Saddam Hussein would “not wish a conflict in which Iraq
will be grievously damaged and his stature as a leader destroyed”. His perception of
damage was “far more focused on reputation than on physical or economic standing”.
Saddam Hussein would:
“… use whatever force is necessary. This is reflected in [...] Saddam’s willingness
to use WMD both internally and regionally if he believes he is about to fall.”
31.  Addressing Saddam Hussein’s decision‑making, the profile stated:
“Although his actions may at times appear obtuse and reckless to the West, Saddam
is a rational actor … Each time he defies the UN or US he will push them, testing

their resolve a step at a time, often until his adversary is on the brink of military
attack … if he feels he is losing control, and becoming increasingly politically
confined and potentially ‘losing’, he can become very dogmatic, increasingly
impulsive and extremely non‑compliant.”
32.  In relation to Saddam Hussein’s perception of risk, the profile stated that he
was only likely to identify alternative strategies “once something has been proved to
fail outright”.
33.  In terms of predicting Saddam Hussein’s future behaviour, the profile stated:
“Saddam maximises benefits before he minimises costs.” He was:
“… not aiming to gain extra power or resources but simply to maintain his current
leadership position. The assumption that the current situation may increase his
intent to take dramatic action, does not, therefore, necessarily apply.
“Whilst there is little doubt that Saddam’s behaviour is being influenced by political
pressure, there are no compelling indications that he is likely to take radical or
unpredictable action. On the contrary, Saddam is currently making decisions and
adopting tactics that make his near term behaviour more predictable and stable
than usual.”
34.  The profile concluded:
“… [Saddam still judges there to be some opportunity to derail moves towards war.]
Whilst his threat perception remains ‘potential’ Saddam will continue to pursue a
strategy of relative compliance, with the main intention of not giving the US or the
UK any ground to move against him militarily; provocation at this stage is therefore
not an option.
“Many factors within the next few months might serve to either maintain Saddam’s
current threat perception, or give him cause to confirm the inevitability of an attack.
The UN resolution is one such factor. If Saddam perceives a semblance of hope in
the resolution, the likelihood of him taking precipitate action remains low. If, however,
the resolution confirms in Saddam’s mind, the inevitability of an attack, then he will
have little motivation to remain compliant.
“In the longer term, there will come a time where Saddam may decide that a strategy
to deal with the potential loss he faces requires him to take radical, aggressive
action. He is unlikely to wait until such a threat becomes imminent. Once he is
confronted with tangible evidence of an inevitable attack, such as troops on Iraq’s
borders … he is likely to conclude that he has no alternative option to guarantee
his survival. In this instance he is likely to act quickly, decisively and whilst he still
maintains some degree of loyalty within his command structures.”
35.  The profile was seen by Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, and
Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office

Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), but there is no indication whether or not
it was seen by Mr Blair.10

Concerns about the US view on the threshold for a material breach
36.  Concerns about the differences between the UK and the US on what would
constitute a material breach, the US stance of “zero tolerance”, and the debate
in the US on “triggers” for military action were already emerging.
37.  A debate on what might constitute a material breach and what actions by Iraq might
trigger a military response had begun within the US Administration before the adoption
of resolution 1441.
38.  Reporting conversations with senior officials in the US Administration on
7 November, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission, British Embassy Washington,
reported that the hawks in Washington saw the resolution as a defeat and warned that
they would be “looking for the least breach of its terms as a justification for resuming the
countdown to war”.11
39.  The US statement after the adoption of resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002 made
it clear that the US would regard every act of Iraqi non‑compliance as an indication that
Iraq had no intention of disarming.12 President Bush had also warned that “the old game
of cheat and retreat” would “no longer be tolerated”.
40.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised overnight on 14‑15 November that there were
indications that President Bush’s reference to “zero tolerance” was causing some
members of the US Administration to seek to lower the bar set in resolution 1441.13
That might include Iraqi attacks on aircraft enforcing the No‑Fly Zones (NFZs), despite
the agreement that operative paragraph (OP)8 of resolution 1441 did not apply to
the NFZs.
41.  Sir David Manning subsequently spoke to Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s
National Security Advisor, on 15 November.14 They agreed that recent Iraqi attacks
on UK and US planes in the NFZs would continue to be treated as a “discrete issue,
separate from what would trigger military action under [resolution] 1441”.
42.  Sir David stated that the UK and the US should not be drawn on “hypothetical
scenarios” about what would constitute a material breach. Reflecting Mr Blair’s words
to President Bush at Camp David on 7 September (see Section 3.4), that “If Saddam

Hussein was obviously in breach we would know”, Sir David added that “the Security
Council would know a material breach when it saw it”. He reported that the US
Administration would continue to insist on “zero tolerance” to keep up the pressure
on Saddam Hussein.
43.  Mr Straw and Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, also discussed Iraq on
15 November, including the reporting in the US that military action was imminent and
inevitable.15 Mr Straw emphasised the need to build as wide a coalition as possible for
any military action. They also discussed the need for patience on the Middle East Peace
Process (MEPP), because of the political situation in Israel.
44.  Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, took a slightly different
view from Sir Jeremy Greenstock about the US Administration’s position.16 As he had
previously warned, “Administration hawks” would “seek to lower as far as possible the
threshold for attacking Iraq”. They hated resolution 1441 and were “looking for ways of
short circuiting it”. But, in his view, the “debate” on the NFZs was now “over”; although if
an aircraft was shot down that would “lead to war”. The reference to “zero tolerance” was
the “key [point] in the Administration’s public presentation”. There would be a “battle …
between the hawks and the rest”. The key would be President Bush’s position.
45.  Sir Christopher also reported that he had been told by a senior member of the
Administration earlier that week that the preferred outcome was for the Iraqi regime
to implode.
46.  Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, was asked, at his pre‑inspections
press conference on 15 November, whether, if Iraq continued to insist in its declaration
that it lacked WMD, that would constitute a material breach.17 He replied that although
Iraq had reaffirmed that it had no such programme, “it would nevertheless have some
time now to check its records”. That might lead to a change of position:
“If, on the other hand, Iraq maintained that position, it would be up to those who had
evidence of such a programme to produce such evidence. If the inspectors came up
with evidence, that would be brought to the notice of the Security Council.”
47.  Mr Blair suggested that the UK should be working on the possibility of
weakening Saddam Hussein’s regime from within. He also wanted to agree a wider
agenda of action with the US.
48.  In a note to No.10 officials on 17 November addressing a range of issues as well
as Iraq, Mr Blair wrote that he did not know if there was “anything in the stories about

Saddam preparing a bolt hole. But we should be working assiduously on trying to
weaken his regime from within.”18
49.  Mr Blair also set out concerns about the risks from WMD more generally:
“The true criticism of us is not that we are doing Iraq; but that we are only doing Iraq.
I agree with DM [David Manning], this needs to form a major part of our agenda with
the US. I want the next bilateral meeting … with the US to draw up an agenda for
action across a range of fronts … the timing is right, i.e. not just on terrorism but on
WMD; MEPP and the Arab world; climate change; WTO [World Trade Organization].
We need to be articulating a strong world vision.”
50.  The note was also sent to Sir Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, Dr John Reid,
the Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party Chair, and Mr Douglas Alexander, the
Minister of State (Cabinet Office).
51.  The MOD reported on 19 November that the option of a military campaign
launched on 6 January appeared to have lapsed, and the timelines were
“uncertain”.
52.  The MOD did not regard the position that we would know a material breach
when we see it as a suitable basis for planning.
53.  Mr Hoon’s view was that agreement with the US on what constituted a trigger
for military action was needed quickly.
54.  On 19 November, following a visit to the US by Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief
of the Defence Staff (CDS), and before the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)
Summit in Prague on 21 November and the planned debate on Iraq on 25 November,
Mr Peter Watkins, Principal Private Secretary to Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary,
sent Sir David Manning an update on military discussions with the US.19 He set out the
themes which had emerged and registered a number of concerns, including the need
to press the US to clarify Turkey’s position.
55.  Mr Watkins wrote that the option of a military campaign launched on 6 January 2003
seemed to have “effectively lapsed” and the timelines were “uncertain”. The US military
position was described as “get ready, but not too ready”, because they did “not want to
bring too large a force to too high a pitch of readiness”. The MOD was concerned that:
“Lack of clarity in US thinking about possible triggers for military action needs to be
resolved quickly, particularly in relation to the No‑Fly Zones.”

56.  Addressing the issue of “Timetable and Triggers”, Mr Watkins wrote:
“To some extent, triggers are now under Saddam’s control and so cannot be slotted
into any firm timetable. Moreover, what constitutes a ‘violation’ and/or ‘material
breach’ remains undefined: many in the US are reduced to saying ‘we’ll know when
we see it’, which is not a suitable base for planning.”
57.  There was “a sense in the US” of “two broad timelines in play, implying two different
plans”. The first was a “high‑impact event to which the US might feel the need to
respond quickly at short notice”. The second was a decision that a material breach had
occurred which would be followed by a “more deliberative build‑up to military action”.
58.  The first scenario would effectively hand the initiative to Saddam Hussein. It might
provoke a rapid response, but that could not be decisive because it could not involve
sufficient land forces to take control of Iraq, “unless … it leads … to regime collapse,
a scenario in which the US seem to invest quite a lot of hope”.
59.  The second scenario would give Saddam Hussein time, which he “might be
able to exploit diplomatically and militarily”. A deliberate campaign “would require
some 60‑90 days’ build‑up, and the time will soon come when the question has to be
confronted of whether it is sensible to contemplate fighting in the summer”. A “common
understanding” needed to be reached with the US and plans “shaped accordingly”.
60.  The MOD was concerned that, if a Coalition aircraft was shot down, it would, “under
long‑standing plans, trigger a massive US response”, which the US might use to trigger
a wider campaign.
61.  Mr Hoon believed that the UK response should include:

•	
•	
•	

pressing the US to “unblock” the Turkish position (on whether it would allow
US and UK forces to transit Turkey);
working “quickly to reach an agreed US/UK view on triggers … well before
we are confronted with it in practice”; and
explaining to the US that hostility in the No‑Fly Zones should be met only
by “self‑defence responses”.

62.  A copy of the letter was sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw, and Mr Gordon
Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head
of OD Sec.
63.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw, and their most senior officials, were clearly aware that
difficult and controversial questions had yet to be resolved in relation to:

•	

what would constitute a further material breach and how and by whom that
would be determined;

15

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

the issue of whether a further resolution would be needed to authorise
force; and

•	

the implications of a veto.

64.  The papers produced before Mr Straw’s meeting on 20 November recognised
that Lord Goldsmith’s advice would be needed to clarify those issues.
65.  A paper on what might constitute a material breach, which highlighted “a number
of difficult questions … on which we will need to consult the Attorney General”,
was prepared by the FCO and sent to Sir David Manning, Sir Jeremy Greenstock,
Sir Christopher Meyer and Mr Watkins on 15 November.20
66.  The FCO paper stated that “Most, if not all members of the Council will be inclined”
to take the view that a “material breach” should be interpreted in the light of the Vienna
Convention. Dr Blix had “made it clear” that he would “be using a similar definition for
the purposes of reporting under OP11”. The paper stated that it was not for Dr Blix to
determine what constituted a material breach, “but his decision (or not) to report to the
Council and the terms in which he reports” would “be influential”.
67.  The FCO stated that the US was “becoming more and more inclined to interpret
the 1441 definition downwards”: “Although, some weeks ago, NSC [National Security
Council] indicated that they would not regard trivial omissions in Iraq’s declaration
[or minor problems encountered by UNMOVIC] as triggers for the use of force,
more recently DoD [Department of Defense] have indicated that they want to test
Saddam early.”
68.  The FCO also drew attention to President Bush’s remarks on 8 November, which
it described as “zero tolerance” and his warning against “unproductive debates” about
what would constitute an Iraqi violation.
69.  An examination of past practice on seven separate occasions since 1991 showed
that the Council had determined Iraq to be in material breach of its obligations where
there seemed “to have been a conviction that an Iraqi act would seriously impede
inspectors in the fulfilment of their mandate and therefore undermine an essential
condition of the cease‑fire”.
70.  Against that background, the FCO listed the following incidents as ones which the
UK would consider to be material breaches:

•	

“[A]ny incident sufficiently serious to demonstrate that Iraq had no real intention
of complying” such as “an Iraqi decision to expel UNMOVIC, or to refuse access
to a particular site, parts of a site or important information”, “discovery by

UNMOVIC/IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] of a concealed weapons
programme, or of a cache of WMD material not declared …”
“Efforts to constrain UNMOVIC/IAEA’s operations in significant ways contrary to
the provisions of SCR 1441 (2002) … and other relevant resolutions. Systematic
efforts to deter, obstruct or intimidate the interview process would need to be
particularly carefully watched.”
“Systematic Iraqi harassment of inspectors … which jeopardised their ability
to fulfil their duties …”
Failure to accept resolution 1441.
“A pattern of relatively minor Iraqi obstructions of UNMOVIC/IAEA.”

71.  On the last point, the paper added:
“We would not take the view that a short (hours) delay in giving UNMOVIC access
to a site would constitute a material breach unless there was clear evidence that the
Iraqis used such a delay to smuggle information out of a site or to coach potential
witnesses. But repeated incidents of such obstruction, even without evidence of
accompanying Iraqi deception, would cumulatively indicate that the Iraqis were not
fully co‑operating, and thus cast doubt upon whether UNMOVIC would ever be able
to implement its mandate properly.”
72.  The FCO stated that a similar US list would “probably … be even tougher”.
“Given the opportunity” in the resolution for the US to make its own report to the Council,
the UK needed “to be clear in our own minds where the dividing lines” were. The paper
recommended that the UK would need to work out “where to draw our red lines” with
the US; and that “in the interests of maintaining maximum Council support for use of
force, we should try to persuade the Americans to focus on the more serious possible
violations, or to establish a pattern of minor obstruction”.
73.  The paper did not address the issue of whether a Council decision would be
needed “to determine that Iraq’s actions justify the serious consequences referred to
in OP13 of 1441”. That would be “a matter on which we will need the Attorney’s views”.
74.  An undated, unsigned document, headed “Background on material breach” and
received in No.10 around 20 November, raised the need to address three, primarily
legal, issues:

•	
•	

the need to clarify whether OP4 “must be construed” in the light of the Vienna
Convention and past practice as that suggested “a much higher bar than
the US”;
the need to seek Lord Goldsmith’s advice “on how OPs 1 and 2 (and 13) and
the declaration of material breach they contain affect the legal situation of Iraq
and our authority to use force”; and specifically whether it could be argued that
“1441 itself (especially OPs 1, 2 and 13 taken together) contains a conditional

17

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

authority to use force … which will be fully uncovered once that Council
discussion has taken place”; and
“What happens if a second Resolution is vetoed?”21

75.  The document appears to have drawn on the analysis in the FCO paper
of 15 November.
76.  On the second issue, the author wrote:
“If this [the argument that 1441 contains a conditional authority to use force] has
merit (and the most we can hope for in the absence of an express Chapter VII
authorisation is a reasonable argument) it would be helpful to know that now.
We would not have to impale ourselves and Ministers on the difficult point of what
happens if the US/UK try and fail to get an express authorisation.
“… we think London seriously needs to consider revising its thinking on 1441.
“… from the point of view of OP4 the question is ‘What does Iraq have to do to put
itself beyond the protection of the law? At what point does its conduct amount to
material breach?’ Innocent until proved guilty.
“But if you come at it through OPs 1 and 2 the question is ‘When has Iraq blown
its last chance? (regardless of whether OP4 is ever breached)’. Compliance
with OP4 is strictly irrelevant: Iraq is guilty but released on a suspended sentence/
parole. This seems to us to have huge presentational angles – as well as whatever
legal deductions can be made. If we are not careful, we are in danger of losing
the key advantage of the resolution and turning a provision which we thought
of deleting as unnecessary into the main operational paragraph of the text …”
77.  Someone in No.10 wrote: “Is this, tho’ a hidden trigger? (We and the US denied that
there was one in 1441.)”22
78.  On what would happen in the event of a veto, the author of the document wrote
that this was:
“… probably too difficult at this stage – everything depends on the circs …
But knowing the answer to the legal implications of 1441 … would either (i) leave us
no worse off than we are – if the AG thinks the argument doesn’t run or (ii) radically
improve the situation if the AG thinks we have a case.”23

79.  Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, commented to
Sir David Manning that the document was:
“… helpful. Of course a S[ecurity] C[ouncil] discussion is needed if there is a material
breach. But as the PM has said all along that discussion must be in the context of an
understanding that action must follow.”24
80.  Mr Straw held an office meeting on 20 November to discuss Iraq policy with
Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), Sir Jeremy Greenstock,
Sir David Manning, and Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director.25
81.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Mr Straw that he “believed we could get a second
resolution provided the Americans did not go for material breach too early”. The “facts
to convince nine members of the Security Council” would be needed. He thought that
the Council “would not … need much persuading”.
82.  Sir Jeremy proposed that “When the time came”, the UK should put down a draft
resolution and, “if we could show that we had done everything possible, then we would
be in the best possible position if – in the end – there were no resolution”.
83.  Sir David Manning suggested that France should be invited to co‑sponsor the
resolution. Mr Straw agreed.
84.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that “the real strength” of resolution 1441 lay in its
first two operative paragraphs: OP1 reaffirming Iraq’s material breach up to the adoption
of 1441 and OP2 suspending that material breach to give Iraq a final opportunity.
Sir Jeremy stated that OP4 (and 11 and 12) were, therefore, not needed to reach the
“serious consequences” in OP13. He was already using that argument in the Security
Council and cautioned Mr Straw that focusing too much on OP4 brought a danger of
weakening OPs 1 and 2.
85.  Sir Michael Jay took a different view, advising that the UK could use all the OPs
in resolution 1441. Mr Straw agreed that it would be a mistake to focus exclusively on
OPs 1 and 2.

The Prague Summit, 21 November 2002
86.  In his remarks at the NATO Summit in Prague on 21 November and in his
subsequent statement to Parliament on 25 November, Mr Blair emphasised the
resolve of the international community and his hope that that would result in the
peaceful disarmament of Iraq; but that if it did not there was a commitment to act.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

87.  In his bilateral discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair assessed that there
was a need to be ready for military action early in the New Year, as soon as
possible after it was clear that there was a material breach. The chance of Saddam
Hussein co‑operating was no higher than 20 percent.
88.  Mr Blair confirmed that the UK would provide military support if that
was necessary.
89.  In preparation for the bilateral discussion with President Bush at the NATO Summit
in Prague, Sir David Manning suggested that the points Mr Blair might cover on Iraq
included:
“We are well placed after … 1441. International community behind us. If we are
patient, and let Saddam make mistakes, they will stay there. We must work together
to help Blix/UNMOVIC. We should avoid being trapped into tight definition of what
would constitute material breach – keep our options open.”26
90.  Mr Alistair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote in
his diaries that he had been told by Mr Dan Bartlett, President Bush’s Communications
Director, at dinner on 20 November that the US view was that it was “seventy to thirty
that there would be war, but that thirty was genuine”.27 They had also discussed the
need to “set up a proper operation in Qatar, not least to have people to make an impact
on Al Jazeera”.
91.  Sir David Manning reported that, during the lunch for Heads of State and
Government, President Bush had emphasised that resolution 1441 was about
disarmament, not inspections.28 As Mr Blair had said at the earlier plenary discussion,
that was not a game of hide and seek. Saddam Hussein must co‑operate. There would
be very severe consequences if he didn’t.
92.  President Bush added that Mr Blair had made the excellent point that the greater
our resolve appeared to be, the greater the chances that the current crisis could be
resolved peacefully. Saddam Hussein must be under no illusion that if he did not disarm,
an international coalition would do the job for him. President Bush had emphasised that
he very much wanted the UN route to work and that he was grateful for the support he
had received.
93.  Sir David reported that there had been “wide support” for President Bush’s
intervention. The Prime Ministers of Denmark, Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal and

Spain had all promised full support. Mr Blair had said that “it was very important that the
UN had come to a common view on Iraq and therefore on the threat from WMD”. It:
“… had been right to go the UN route; but we must now have the courage to go
the whole way. The international community had expressed its will and set out its
demands. It must not flinch from enforcing them.”
94.  In the press conference before the bilateral meeting with Mr Blair, President Bush
was asked about his expectations of support from the UK in the event of “possible
conflict” in Iraq.29 He replied:
“My expectation is that we can do this peacefully if Saddam Hussein disarms …
If he chooses not to disarm, we will work with our close friends, the closest of which
is Great Britain, and we will disarm him. But our first choice is not to use the military
option, our first choice is for Mr Saddam Hussein to disarm and that is where we will
be devoting a lot of our energies.”
95.  Mr Blair stated:
“We will do what is necessary both to secure ourselves at home and to make sure
that the will of the United Nations is enforced abroad. And I think what you will
find here at the NATO Summit is a total and united determination … that Saddam
Hussein has to disarm himself … and how that happens is a choice for him. We
hope and want it to happen through the United Nations inspectors … But if he fails
to co‑operate with them … then he will be disarmed by force, and that is the clear
will of the international community …”
96.  In his bilateral discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair confirmed that the UK would
support the US militarily if necessary.30
97.  In response to a request for his views on the military planning, Mr Blair said there
was a need to be ready for military action early in the New Year and as soon as possible
after it became clear that there was a material breach. There was a chance of Saddam
Hussein co‑operating, but it was “no higher than 20 percent”.
98.  In a discussion about what co‑operation meant, Mr Blair’s view was that Iraq’s
duty to co‑operate extended to the declaration, the inspections and the interviews.
The inspectors were “meant to enter Iraq and dismantle all the WMD with full
co‑operation with Iraq … [I]t was not a game of cat and mouse.” He thought that
“Saddam would miscalculate at some point”. Mr Blair doubted that Saddam Hussein
would admit to up to date WMD facilities or technology, but he might admit to some
residual WMD.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

99.  Mr Blair thought that there was “an outside possibility of Saddam’s regime
crumbling”.
100.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the need to provide support for Dr Blix
and to be clear about his role, including that it would not be for Dr Blix to take decisions
on military action.
101.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the importance of moving forward
on the Middle East Peace Process, which would become easier to manage without
Saddam Hussein, and the need to persuade Israel not to escalate the conflict if it
was attacked by Iraq.
102.  Describing the Summit in his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that the “press were all
focused on Iraq, and on the line that the US had pretty much decided”.31
103.  Mr Campbell wrote that President Bush:
“… felt there was a need for real pressure to build through troop movements,
international condemnation, really tough and unpredictable inspections, to get
Saddam off balance.
“… once we made that phone call that agrees Saddam’s in breach, we had to do
something militarily and quickly. Quick sustainable bombing raid, and boots on the
ground … [I]f Blix gets dicked around, while a US or UK plane gets shot down, we
go for him.
“… was clearly not keen on Blix, said he was wringing his hands and talking war and
peace but ‘That is our judgement. He is not going to get between us and freedom.
Once we strike we go for it, we don’t wait …’”
104.  Mr Campbell also wrote that, in response to a comment from Mr Blair that he
“believed the regime would crumble pretty quickly”, President Bush had said that “both
our secret services needed to be put to work to help that. They were thinking of a list of
the top ten most wanted as part of a divide and rule strategy …”
105.  Mr Rycroft’s record of the conversation confirms Mr Campbell’s account.32
106.  In Sir David Manning’s bilateral meeting with Dr Rice, they discussed the possibility
of seeking an “audit” of Iraq’s declaration of its WMD holdings and pressing for
implementation of the provision in resolution 687 (1991) that stipulated Saddam Hussein
must pass legislation requiring the Iraqi people to reveal any WMD or associated
facilities.33 That would be a test of how co‑operative Saddam Hussein intended to be.

107.  The statement on Iraq issued after the Summit said that the 19 Heads of State and
Government had:
“… expressed our serious concern about terrorism and the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction.
“Concerning Iraq, we pledge our full support for the implementation of … resolution
1441 and call on Iraq to comply fully and immediately with this and all relevant UN
Security Council resolutions.
“We deplore Iraq’s failure to comply fully with its obligations, which were imposed
as a necessary step to restore international peace and security and we recall the
Security Council has decided in its resolution to afford Iraq a final opportunity to
comply …
“NATO Allies stand united in their commitment to take effective action to assist
and support the efforts of the UN to ensure full and immediate compliance by Iraq,
without conditions or restriction, with UNSCR 1441. We recall that the Security
Council in this resolution has warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences
as a result of its continued violation of its obligations.”34
108.  In his statement to Parliament on 25 November, Mr Blair described the Summit
as “a profound demonstration of unity in the face of the new threats that confront us”.35
“Every nation” had spoken of “the menace of international terrorism and weapons of
mass destruction”. The Summit statement was “a remarkable statement of defiance”
which had “rightly” linked terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. The threat from
WMD “in the hands of rogue unstable states” was:
“… not part of some different danger …
“The strength of the … statement on Iraq was testimony to that belief. There was
complete unanimity … that the choice for war or peace lies with Saddam, and that
if he breaches the will of the United Nations, the United Nations will have to act.
There was strong support for multilateralism and for the decision of President Bush
to go through the UN, but equally strong insistence that multilateralism and the UN
be seen to work.
“Some of the most powerful expressions of these sentiments … came not from the
old but from the new members of the NATO Alliance.”
109.  Mr Blair concluded that the “ultimate message” from the Summit was that “if we
care about these values of freedom, the rule of law and democracy, we should not flinch
from the fight in defending them”; and that “Britain” would “defend them with courage
and certainty”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

110.  In response to a question from Mr Doug Henderson (Labour) about whether action
without the express authority of the UN would lack “international political legitimacy” and
“severely damage” the UN and NATO, Mr Blair responded that it “would all depend on
the circumstances”. In Kosovo, action had been taken “outside the UN because there
was an unreasonable blockage against action being taken”. Mr Blair did not believe that
the Security Council would “get to that point” on Iraq: “The countries that signed up to
the deal at the United Nations know that if there is a breach by Saddam we have to act.”
111.  Asked by Mr Alan Simpson (Labour) for an assurance that, before he committed
“any British troops or support to such a war” Mr Blair would seek a specific mandate
through the UN and a specific vote in advance from the House of Commons, Mr Blair
replied that Mr Straw would “deal with both points” in the debate on resolution 1441 later
that day.
112.  In response to a question from Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour) about the effect of
discussion in the Security Council and if it would have “the final judgement”, Mr Blair
replied that it would “be for the weapons inspectors to say whether there is a breach”,
and that there would then be “a discussion about the seriousness of that breach”.
“All that” the UK had been “saying throughout” was that “the implication is that if there is
a significant breach, there must be action”. There was an “international consensus” that
it was “not sensible to tie ourselves down to every single set of circumstances, that we
want to keep some freedom of manoeuvre and that we should keep maximum pressure
on Saddam”.
113.  Mr Blair added:
“President Bush made a principled and difficult decision to go through the United
Nations. He was right to do that. We supported him strongly and we are now obliged
to ensure that the UN route works. I believe that we can do it in a way that avoids
conflict, if at all possible.”
114.  Mr Blair’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords.36 No major issues on Iraq
were raised.
115.  An Oral Question on the UK’s policy on Iraq had been answered earlier that
afternoon when a number of issues, including who would be responsible for determining
a material breach, the potential consequences in the region of military action in Iraq, and
the need for an effective and well‑planned exit were raised.37

117.  Mr Scarlett concluded that the Iraqi regime was confident in its ability
to mislead the inspectors.
118.  Subsequent intelligence that Saddam Hussein had made clear that UNMOVIC
was to be given no grounds for claiming that inspections were being obstructed
was interpreted as part of a policy of concealment. The possibility that it might
have indicated an intention to co‑operate with UNMOVIC appears not to have been
considered.
119.  Mr Scarlett wrote to Sir David Manning and other senior officials on 21 November
drawing their attention to “the first significant … intelligence we have received on
the Iraqi regime’s thinking on how to manage UNMOVIC” since the adoption of
resolution 1441.38
120.  Mr Scarlett stated that the key points were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq intended to demonstrate its ostensible co‑operation with UNMOVIC but
would actually resume its game playing.
Iraq intended to declare a small part of its illegal programmes, and overload
UNMOVIC with large quantities of information on legitimate activities.
WMD was seen as vital to the regime’s survival, so a core WMD capability and
infrastructure must be retained.
Iraq was concerned about the provisions for conducting interviews of Iraqis
outside Iraq, which could expose illicit procurement.
There was concern about the potential destruction by the inspectors of dual‑use
facilities.

121.  Mr Scarlett commented that the concerns exposing illicit procurement might be
referring to conventional weapons programmes and that the dual‑use facilities supported
“the WMD programmes”.
122.  Mr Scarlett wrote that the intelligence confirmed earlier JIC judgements, including
the identification of “overload” as a potential strategy. There was no intelligence on which
illegal programmes might be declared.
123.  Mr Scarlett also drew attention to preparations to intimidate potential Iraqi
interviewees.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

124.  Mr Scarlett’s other comments included the observations that:

•	
•	

There seemed to be “an inconsistency in Iraq’s policy towards inspectors.
The [intelligence] indicates the regime plans to let the inspectors into any site.
But it also indicates that the regime must rethink a core WMD capability.”
It was “possible” that Iraq was “so confident of its concealment strategy that
it believes inspectors will not discover prohibited activity. Nonetheless, this
[intelligence] is important in that it further confirms that ultimately the Iraqi
regime does not envisage having to accept genuine and complete disarmament,
and is confident in its ability to mislead inspectors”.

125.  The intelligence described by Mr Scarlett was based on reported comments,
including from someone with access to senior members of the Iraqi regime; but it
was not quoting Saddam Hussein’s views.
126.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“There was some interesting stuff around on deception programmes, for example
[Iraqi] officials being forced to put papers and materials in their homes with the
warning that they and their families would be harmed if they were lost.”39
127.  The Assessments Staff Intelligence Update on 26 November stated that
intelligence indicated Saddam Hussein was personally handling all dealings with
UNMOVIC; and he was confident the inspectors would not find anything, nor find
grounds for claiming Iraq had obstructed its work.40
128.  The Update was summarising intelligence from a reliable source quoting Saddam
Hussein’s own views second hand. The intelligence reported that Saddam had made
clear UNMOVIC was to be given no grounds for claiming that inspections were being
obstructed; not that he was confident that the inspectors would not find grounds for
claiming that they were being obstructed.

Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix, 22 November 2002
129.  Mr Blair was advised to tell Dr Blix in a meeting on 22 November that there
was a need for UNMOVIC to “bolster its credibility with some in the US”; and that
UNMOVIC should make full use of the powers resolution 1441 had provided.
130.  Dr Blix told Mr Blair that Iraq’s tactics seemed to be co‑operation on practical
arrangements but no real change in their approach.
131.  Mr Blair said inspections should not be a game of hide and seek, and that
one of the reasons for strong action on Iraq was to deter others.

132.  At a press conference on 15 November, Dr Blix had identified potential practical
problems with interviews outside Iraq.41
133.  In response to a question about whether it was possible for Iraqi experts to be
interviewed adequately inside the country, Dr Blix responded that:
“… interviews were an important source of information. If there were a big weapons
programme in Iraq there would be many people engaged in it. The UNSCOM [UN
Special Commission] and the IAEA had interviewed a lot of people in the past and
learned a great deal. He [Dr Blix] was also aware that most of the interviews had
gone rather well and without great problems. There was also quite a number in
which the persons interviewed were clearly intimidated by Iraqi representatives.
Hence, there should be the possibility for interviews to be done in private, with
the IAEA and the Commission deciding the modalities and the place for them.
The question would be whether in the present atmosphere the Iraqis would be
willing to be interviewed alone. He said he understood the need for the interviews
to be carried out abroad. Defectors had been a very important source of information,
and would presumably continue to be so. His concerns were about the practicality
of taking people abroad if the [Iraq] Government was not willing to allow that
to happen.”
134.  An advance team of 30 staff from UNMOVIC travelled to Baghdad with Dr Blix and
Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, on 18 November to prepare for
inspections.42
135.  In Mr Straw’s office meeting of 20 November with Sir Michael Jay and others,
discussed earlier in this Section, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that UNMOVIC was
“desperate for professional help (e.g. sniffing equipment and investigation techniques).
So far they had been underwhelmed by the initial UK response.”43
136.  Mr Straw had agreed the UK should do more.
137.  Mr Charles Gray, Head of the FCO Middle East Department, advised the Cabinet
Office that the UK was providing a list of 10 suspect sites, including the test bed site
at al‑Rafah, which they would like UNMOVIC to inspect at an early stage.44 It was
also planning to offer a list of the top 10 individuals the UK thought UNMOVIC should
interview as a priority.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

138.  In preparation for his meeting with Dr Blix on 22 November, the FCO advised
Mr Blair that it would be helpful if he could give Dr Blix a number of key messages,
including that the UK:

•	
•	
•	

had “worked very hard” for resolution 1441 and it was determined to do
everything it could to make it work and UNMOVIC was vital to that;
would do “whatever we can” to meet Dr Blix’s “practical needs”, including
intelligence support;
did “not want to compromise UNMOVIC’s credibility as an independent
organisation”, but there was a need for UNMOVIC to “bolster its credibility with
some in the US”; UNMOVIC should make full use of the powers resolution 1441
had provided.45

139.  The FCO stated that there was “a continued whispering campaign against”
Dr Blix in the US press. The UK was “keen to see a programme of multiple inspections
designed to stretch Iraqi countermeasures and put Saddam’s willingness to co‑operate
under early test”. But the UK recognised “that UNMOVIC will need time to re‑establish
itself … It will not help our objectives if we push the inspectors into making mistakes
by forcing them to run before they can walk.”
140.  The FCO advised that the US was “putting great weight” on the powers in
resolution 1441 for UNMOVIC and the IAEA to interview individuals free of Iraqi
Government “minders”, if necessary outside Iraq. The UK agreed that interviews would
be a “very important route to obtaining the sort of information we will need if covert Iraqi
programmes are to be uncovered”. But the UK also understood Dr Blix’s “concerns
about the practical and legal implication of extracting Iraqis – perhaps with a large
number of family members – from Iraq and then holding them perhaps indefinitely”.
The US had admitted that it had not “thought through all these points” although it was
now doing so.
141.  In their meeting on 22 November, Mr Blair told Dr Blix that there had been much
support at the Prague Summit for him and the inspectors, and for a tough line on the
need for full Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.46
142.  Dr Blix reported that he had told the Iraqi Foreign Minister and others in Baghdad
that Iraq should not make the mistakes it had made after the Gulf Conflict of providing
an incomplete account of their holdings; and that they should not repeat the mistake
of playing with the UN and offering too little too late. He had not, however, detected
any sign that the Iraqi approach had changed. Nor was there any sign of legislation
to prohibit involvement by Iraqi citizens in WMD programmes; that could be passed
overnight and would have got Iraqi co‑operation off to a flying start. Preparations for

the first inspections were well under way. Iraq’s tactics appeared to be co‑operation
on practical arrangements but no real change in their approach to giving up their WMD.
143.  Mr Blair agreed with Dr Blix that the preference was Iraqi compliance and that the
“inspections should not be a game of hide and seek”. Mr Blair concluded that “one of the
reasons for a strong multi‑lateral approach on Iraq was to deter others”.
144.  Sir David Manning said that Dr Blix should audit the declaration and be
ready to audit new material supplied by the UK and US. Mr Blair “strongly agreed.
He emphasised that it was important the Iraqis knew that if Blix found their declaration to
be false it would constitute a material breach”. Dr Blix had “agreed”, adding that “denying
access would also be a material breach”.

Security Council, 25 November 2002
145.  Dr Blix provided an informal briefing to the Security Council on 25 November
reporting on his and Dr ElBaradei’s visit to Baghdad from 18 to 19 November.47
They had been assured that Iraq intended to provide full co‑operation. The first group
of UNMOVIC and IAEA inspectors had arrived in Baghdad earlier on 25 November, and
inspections would begin on 27 November, only 19 days after the adoption of resolution
1441. The report to the Security Council specified in OP5 would, therefore, be due on
27 January 2003.
146.  Dr Blix reported that he had told Iraq that “many governments believed that
WMD programmes remained in Iraq”; and that “The Council had wanted to offer Iraq
a last opportunity. If the Iraqi side were to state – as it still did at our meeting – that
there were no such programmes, it would need to provide convincing documentary
or other evidence.” The FFCDs (Full, Final, and Complete Declarations) submitted
by Iraq to UNSCOM had, “in many cases left it an open question whether some
weapons remained”.
147.  Dr Blix also reported that he had been assured by:

•	
•	

Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, of “firm French support
for the implementation stage”; and
Mr Blair that the UK Government would provide “support for effective
inspections” and that it was determined to “ensure the implementation of
resolution 1441 … and the elimination of WMDs and long‑range missiles
from Iraq”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Debate on resolution 1441, 25 November 2002
148.  The House of Commons voted on 25 November to “support” resolution
1441 and agreed that if the Government of Iraq failed “to comply fully” with its
provisions, “the Security Council should meet in order to consider the situation
and the need for full compliance”.
149.  Mr Straw’s speech focused on the definition of a material breach and
whether it would be for the Security Council to determine whether such a breach
had occurred.
150.  After its return from recess, the House of Commons debated resolution 1441
on 25 November.
151.  The Government motion proposed:
“That this House supports UNSCR 1441 as unanimously adopted by the UN
Security Council; agrees that the Government of Iraq must comply fully with all
provisions of the resolution; and agrees that, if it fails to do so, the Security Council
should meet in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance.”48
152.  Mr Michael Moore (Liberal Democrat) proposed an amendment to make it clear
that the Security Council should determine whether military action should be taken. The
amendment proposed the following addition to the Government motion:
“… and believes that any decision that Iraq is in material breach of resolution 1441
is for the UN Security Council as a whole to determine and that no military action
to enforce resolution 1441 should be taken against Iraq without a mandate from the
UN Security Council; and further believes that no British forces should be committed
to any such military action against Iraq without a debate in this House and a
substantive motion in favour.”49
153.  Normally the Speaker of the House of Commons, selects the amendment
proposed by the Official Opposition.50
154.  In his opening speech, Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 had “one central
aim: the peaceful removal of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction through an effective
inspection regime”.51 He set out the inspection process, including that inspections would
resume in Iraq by 27 November, “four weeks ahead of the Security Council’s deadline”.

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

155.  Mr Straw also posed and then answered four “key questions” which arose from
the resolution:

•	
•	
•	

What constituted a material breach?

•	

Whether, if military action was necessary, the House of Commons would be able
to vote on it and, if so, when?

Who would decide what happened if there was a material breach?
Whether there would be a second Security Council resolution if military action
proved necessary?

156.  Addressing what would constitute a material breach, Mr Straw referred to operative
paragraph 4 of the resolution, but went on to say:
“As with any definition of that type, it is never possible to give an exhaustive list of all
the conceivable behaviours that it covers. That judgement has to be made against
the real circumstances that arise, but I reassure the House that material breach
means something significant: some behaviour or pattern of behaviour that is serious.
Among such breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to
obstruct or impede the inspectors, to intimidate witnesses, or a pattern of behaviour
where any single action appears relatively minor but the actions as a whole add up
to something deliberate and more significant: something that shows Iraq’s intention
not to comply.”
157.  Mr Straw also stated that the resolution made clear that there were two parts
to a material breach, “a failure of disclosure and other failure to comply”.
158.  Addressing who would decide what happened if there was a material breach,
Mr Straw stated that if there were “any further material breach”, it would be reported
to the Security Council “for assessment” and the Council would convene immediately
to “consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all the relevant …
resolutions in order to secure international peace and security”.
159.  Mr Straw added:
“If there is evidence of a false statement or omission, together with a failure to
comply in other respects, it can be reported to the Security Council as a further
material breach either by a Security Council member or by the inspectors.
The Council will undoubtedly require the opinion of the inspectors, regardless
of who makes the final report.
“There is then a clear requirement for an immediate meeting of the Security Council
to make the assessment … Where the breach is flagrant – say, a physical and
serious attack on the inspectors the decision on whether there had been a material
breach will effectively have been made by the Iraqis … there will be no decision to
be made. The Security Council will undoubtedly then act …”

31

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

160.  Addressing the need for a second Security Council resolution if military action
proved necessary, Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 did:
“… not stipulate that there has to be a second … resolution to authorise military
action in the event of a further material breach … The idea that there should be
a second resolution was an alternative discussed informally among members of
the … Council … during the weeks of negotiation, but no draft to that effect was
ever tabled … nor put to the vote ...
“I should make it clear … that the preference of the Government in the event of
any material breach is that there should be a second … resolution authorising
military action. However, the faith being placed in the Security Council … requires
the Council to show a corresponding level of responsibility. So far it has done and
I believe it will do so in the future, but we must reserve our position in the event that
it does not … So the discussion … in the event of a material breach, will be on the
understanding action will follow.”
161.  Mr Straw also stated:
“… the moment there is any evidence of a material breach … there will be a
meeting of the Security Council at which it is … open for any member to move any
resolution … Our preference is for a Security Council resolution, and I hope we
would move it.”
162.  Addressing whether the House of Commons would be able to vote if military action
was necessary and, if so, when, Mr Straw told Parliament:
“No decision on military action has yet been taken … and I fervently hope that none
will be necessary … However, we have got this far in terms of Saddam’s compliance
only because active diplomacy has been backed by the credible threat of force.
For that threat to remain credible, it is crucial that we make proper preparations.”
163.  Mr Straw stated:
“Any decision … to take military action will be put to the House as soon as possible
after it has been taken … [T]he Government have no difficulty about the idea of a
substantive motion on military action … at the appropriate time.”
“… If we can come to the House without placing our troops at risk, we shall do so …”
164.  In response to questions, Mr Straw added:
“… if we can and if it is safe to do so, we will propose a resolution seeking the
House’s approval of decisions … before military action takes place.”
165.  Mr Michael Ancram (Conservative) supported the motion although he sought to
highlight divisions within the Parliamentary Labour Party by asserting that he would have
“liked the motion to be more specific and stronger … and to dispel the uncertainties

32

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

which … cloud parts of the issue.”52 He referred to the statement made by Mr Blair in his
interview with Radio Monte Carlo on 14 November that if Saddam failed to disarm “the
consequence is that the weapons will be disarmed by force”.
166.  Mr Hoon assured the House of Commons that military action would be a
last resort. There were “prudent preparations and planning necessary for military
action”, but that did “not mean a commitment to take such action”.
167.  In his speech closing the debate, Mr Hoon stated:
“Neither Britain nor the United States is looking for a pretext for military action, which
is always a grave step, and which will certainly be a last resort. No member of the
Government will risk British lives unnecessarily.”53
168.  In response to a question from Mr Mohammad Sarwar (Labour), Mr Hoon added:
“We expect Saddam Hussein to have the survival instinct … to co‑operate with
UNMOVIC and to comply with resolution 1441, but we cannot exclude the possibility
that he will fail to do so. Let us not delude ourselves. All our experience shows that
Saddam Hussein has only ever complied with the will of the international community
when diplomacy has been backed by the credible threat of force.”
169.  Mr Hoon stated that continuing with “the prudent preparations and planning
necessary for military action” was the “only responsible course”. But that did “not mean
a commitment to take such action in any circumstances”. It did mean that appropriate
steps were being taken “to ensure that British forces” were “ready”, and that they had
“the training, equipment and support” that they would need “to undertake military action,
should it prove necessary”.
170.  Addressing the US request to “a number of countries … seeking support in the
event that military action proves necessary”, Mr Hoon stated:
“Although no decision has been made to commit UK forces to military action,
discussions with the US will continue so that an appropriate British contribution can
be identified should it prove necessary.
“… There is no inevitability about military action. The US is clear about the fact that
the issue is Iraqi disarmament …
“Those who have accused the US of unilateralism should consider carefully. The
US Government have followed an impeccably multilateral approach, first in building
unanimous Security Council support for resolution 1441 and now in seeking to build
broad‑based support for military action should it be required … within the limits

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

imposed by these uncertainties, we have been considering the contribution we might
be able to make if military action ultimately becomes necessary.
“At this stage it would be inappropriate to go into details of the size and shape of
forces that might be involved, for two specific reasons. First, as events unfold and
time passes, plans will inevitably evolve. It would be misleading to describe specific
force packages today as if they had some permanent and definitive status …
Secondly, as I am sure the House appreciates, I have no intention of assisting
Saddam Hussein’s contingency planning.”
171.  The Liberal Democrat amendment was defeated by 452 votes to 85.
172.  The question of who would be responsible for interpreting whether there had
been a material breach was also raised by Baroness Williams of Crosby in an Oral
Question in the House of Lords.
173.  In response to an Oral Question from Baroness Williams of Crosby, Baroness
Symons of Vernham Dean, the joint FCO/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
Minister for Trade and Investment, stated on 25 November that she could not:
“… give an exhaustive list of what amounts to a material breach. It would be a
question of judgement at the time … it might be referred by the inspectorate …
it might be referred by a member of the … Security Council. There would be an
immediate meeting, when no doubt there would be a discussion about how serious
such a breach was.”54
174.  In response to a question from Lord Howell of Guildford, about whether a further
resolution would be required before the UK could “go to war”, Baroness Symons
responded that resolution 1441 did:
“… not stipulate that there has to be a second Security Council resolution to
authorise military action. Such a stipulation was never tabled … the preference
of the British Government in the event of a material breach is that there should
be a second resolution. But we are not about rewriting UNSCR 1441. It says what
it says, and it does not say that such a second resolution would be necessary.”
CABINET, 28 NOVEMBER 2002
175.  In Cabinet on 28 November, Mr Straw described the vote in the House of
Commons on 25 November as an “overwhelming endorsement of the Government’s
strategy towards Iraq”.55 The next deadline for Iraq was the requirement for a full
declaration of their weapons of mass destruction programmes by 8 December.

176.  Cabinet was also informed that the Oil‑for‑Food resolution had been rolled over for
only nine days because of difficulties with the United States on the Goods Review List.
177.  Cabinet did not discuss the issues.
178.  A FCO report on Saddam Hussein’s crimes and humanitarian abuses, which was
published on 2 December, is addressed in Section 6.4.

Iraq’s declaration of 7 December and the response
179.  Resolution 1441 (OP3) required Iraq to provide:
“… not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a currently accurate, full
and complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes to develop chemical,
biological, and nuclear weapons, ballistic missiles and other delivery systems
such as unmanned vehicles and dispersal systems designed for use on aircraft,
including any holdings and the precise locations of such weapons, components,
sub‑components, stocks of agents, and related material and equipment, the
locations and work of its research development and production facilities, as well as
all other chemical, biological, and nuclear programmes, including for any which it
claims are for purposes not related to weapons production or material.”56
180.  The inclusion of a mandatory requirement for an immediate declaration of Iraq’s
WMD holdings by a defined date had been the subject of much discussion during the
negotiation of resolution 1441 (see Section 3.5).
181.  Mr Straw had originally warned that it would provide Iraq with opportunities for
obfuscation, leading to endless arguments within the Council.57
182.  In a conversation with Secretary Powell on 16 September, Mr Straw had suggested
that a full, final and complete declaration could only be done once the inspectors were in
Iraq.58
183.  The JIC Assessment of 14 November stated that Iraq would “try to overload
UNMOVIC by releasing large volumes of information”; and that it would “seek to take
advantage of any opportunity to fudge” its obligations.59
184.  On 20 November, in response to a remit from COBR(R) (see Section 2), Mr Gray
provided a note, agreed within the FCO and with DIS about how to handle Iraq’s likely
efforts to flood UNMOVIC with masses of detail as an obfuscatory tactic.60

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

185.  Mr Gray pointed out that:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Resolution 1441 required Iraq to declare all relevant material even if it was not
used for WMD production.
UNMOVIC had an extensive database of dual‑use facilities and it was thought
that there could be a need to examine about 700 sites.
UNMOVIC could take some time to scrutinise and update that “mass of material
(even US analysts with very large resources at their disposal) have admitted …
that going through the material could take months)”.
There was an expectation that there would be “many discrepancies” between
the Iraqi declaration and UNSCOM documentation and approvals under
resolution 661 (1990).

186.  Sir David Manning warned Mr Blair in late November that there would be
pressure on President Bush to move to military action as soon as Iraq submitted
the declaration required by resolution 1441.
187.  The UK position remained that the declaration could not constitute a
casus belli. If an “audit” by the inspectors subsequently discovered significant
discrepancies in the declaration that could constitute a material breach.
188.  Following a conversation with Dr Rice on 24 November to “explore next steps on
Iraq”, Sir David Manning reported to Mr Blair that Dr Rice had returned to the suggestion
she had made in their discussion during the NATO Summit in Prague that Dr Blix
should audit Iraq’s declaration and the information provided by the US and UK; and that
she was:
“… confident this would expose an ‘audit gap’. It was very unlikely Saddam would
account for the WMD outstanding … and very unlikely that Saddam would include
the details of secret holdings …”61
189.  Sir David stated that he had told Dr Rice that he thought Mr Blair:
“… would have no difficulty with this. Establishing a base‑line audit was presumably
what the declaration was all about … we could not accept that the declaration
itself could be a casus belli. But we were in no doubt that if the declaration proved
false when Blix and UNMOVIC began their inspections Saddam would be in
material breach.”
190.  Sir David added that, if it was decided to adopt that strategy, “we should try to bring
the French and Russians with us. This pointed to a discussion in the Security Council …”

191.  Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the positions of France and Russia and
indications that their stance might have shifted in response to a calculation that “one way
or another, the game was up for Saddam”.
192.  Sir David reported that he had told Dr Rice that, if President Bush was “willing to
continue down the UN route, he would have the international community pretty much
behind him. As long as there were UN cover, very few of the key countries seemed
likely to break ranks.” The unanimous support for resolution 1441, President Bush’s
victory in the US mid‑term elections and his performance in Prague had “changed the
terms of trade”.
193.  Sir David told Mr Blair that Dr Rice had asked if he would be willing to talk to
President Bush. There were some people in Washington who would want to argue for
military action as soon as the Iraqi declaration was available. President Bush would
be under a lot of pressure from those who wanted him to discount the international
dimension.
194.  Sir David told Dr Rice he was sure Mr Blair would welcome a discussion. He added
that, in his view, the UN process had been a triumph for President Bush. “If he were
patient, he would now be able to take an international coalition with him all the way.
This would have benefits for US policy across the board.” That would not be
incompatible with a strategy “to audit the gap”, particularly if “support or acquiescence”
from France and Russia had been secured.
195.  Sir David commented that Dr Rice had been “clearly signalling that [President]
Bush would probably be willing to continue working within UN parameters, taking the
international community with him, if you [Mr Blair] made the case”. He concluded:
“… this offers us a valuable opening to influence President Bush at a key
moment. I suggest you speak to him … when we have had another day to digest
developments post Prague.”
196.  Mr Blair told President Bush on 26 November that he thought the inspectors
probably would find something, and that would be the trigger for military action.
197.  Mr Blair telephoned President Bush on 26 November to discuss the outcome of the
Prague Summit, Mr Blair’s discussion with Dr Blix and the response to Iraq’s declaration,
and how to make progress on the Middle East Peace Process.62
198.  In the discussion on Iraq, Mr Blair stated that if Iraq did not provide a full
declaration, Dr Blix should produce his own audit. Mr Blair “accepted that the first time
the inspectors found anything significant that was not in the declaration would constitute
a material breach”. He thought that the inspectors probably would find something and
that this would be the trigger for military action.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

199.  Concerns were already being expressed in discussions between the
US and UK about whether, in the face of Iraq’s deception and concealment
activities, the inspections would be able to find evidence of a material breach –
a “smoking gun”.
200.  The UK sought to persuade the US not to make snap judgements on the
declaration and to allow Dr Blix to make the first formal response.
201.  On 29 November, in response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Straw’s
Private Office provided advice on handling the Iraqi declaration.63
202.  The FCO advised that Iraq could maintain it had “no WMD and defy UNMOVIC/
IAEA to prove them wrong, confident that they can conceal the programmes uncovered
by UNSCOM in 1998”, but the expectation was that it would be “more subtle:
declaring very large quantities of dual‑use items and programmes and reiterating
all … past declarations. In both cases our assumption is that they will continue to hide
programmes …”
203.  Dr ElBaradei had suggested that the nuclear declaration was “likely to contain
information that would be of use to proliferators”; and that it should not be circulated to
the Council as a whole. Resolution 1441 required Iraq to provide the declaration to the
inspectors and the Council.
204.  The FCO anticipated that the US might “plan to rush out its own analysis (and
probable dismissal) of the document in very short order” and advised that any immediate
criticism of a lengthy and technical declaration would be likely to be regarded as
“evidence of a determination to pursue military action regardless”. It might also lead
to requests for evidence which might not be releasable or would alert Iraq to potential
inspections.
205.  The FCO expected the US to focus on seven areas in the declaration:

•	
•	
•	
•	

ballistic missiles;

•	
•	
•	

mobile WMD facilities;

biological programmes;
chemical programmes;
an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) programme intended to deliver chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) agents;
the outstanding discrepancies in relation to CBW munitions; and
the procurement of aluminium tubes.

206.  The FCO advised that it would be best to “delay giving a definitive response until
we have been able to assess the content, while expressing a healthy scepticism based

on Iraq’s past record of deceit”. There was a “need to avoid giving the impression that an
omission in the declaration would, in itself, constitute a material breach”. The UK should
caution the US “against a rush to judgement”.
207.  The UK aim should be to get the inspectors to “check (or audit)” the declaration
“as soon as possible through intrusive inspections, interviews and access to records”
against information from other sources, including:

•	
•	

•	

The information available to UNSCOM in 1998. If Iraq declared “nothing”, it
“must demonstrate the destruction of material or the disbandment of possible
WMD programmes identified by UNSCOM”.
“Intelligence material provided by the US/UK. We have already pointed
UNMOVIC towards key sites and provided a list of 6,500 individuals involved
in WMD programmes”; the DIS was “working on a top ten list of people”.
UNMOVIC/IAEA was “willing to visit sites not mentioned” by Iraq but they would
“not want to be seen to be taking instructions from the UK/US”.
“Information obtained … through early interviews …”

Where the declaration was “inconsistent with intelligence”, the UK would “want
UNMOVIC/IAEA to be able to discover that inconsistency on the ground before notifying
the Council”. That would avoid giving Iraq the chance to conceal evidence.
208.  The FCO stated that an early initial meeting of the Security Council in
mid‑December would demonstrate support for the inspectors and maintain pressure
on Iraq as well as demonstrating the intention “to keep the Council at the centre of Iraq
handling”. That should also call for a more detailed discussion of the declaration in early
January. That would “give the US/UK a better opportunity (and more time) to highlight
shortcomings” before the meeting of the Council to discuss the inspectors report, which
was due on 27 January.
209.  The FCO letter also provided a refined version of the advice in its letter to Sir David
Manning of 15 November about what might comprise a material breach. This was further
refined in advice on 6 December, which is addressed later in this Section.
210.  Mr Campbell had asked Mr John Williams, FCO Press Secretary, for “a wider
note on handling in the context of a set of public objectives to be agreed with the US”.
That would include:

•	
•	

The declaration would be “a key test of Iraq’s willingness to comply”.

•	

The UK would be drawing “any discrepancies or mis‑statements … to the
attention of UNMOVIC/IAEA and, if necessary the Security Council, where the
issues will be pursued”.

The inspectors needed to test the declaration before a decision could be taken
on whether Saddam Hussein was in breach or complying.

39

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

With “his long record of obstruction and deceit”, Saddam Hussein was
“unlikely to make an honest declaration”; the UK wanted “to see his dishonesty
demonstrated by inspections” if he made a false declaration.
The UK would not allow the process “to become an indefinite game of hide
and seek”.

211.  In a discussion between No.10 and FCO officials and a team of US officials on
2 December, one senior US official expressed doubts about whether the inspectors
would ever find any WMD evidence.64
212.  In a separate meeting between FCO and MOD officials and the team of US
officials, it was suggested that the strategy of “force of [sic] mind” had not got through to
Saddam Hussein, partly it was thought because of the mixed signals from France and
Russia.65 One US official thought that once he did get that message Saddam’s position
might “shift very quickly”.
213.  Concerns were also expressed about the activities of Al Qaida in northern Iraq.
214.  On 3 and 4 December, Sir David Manning discussed the need to avoid making
snap judgements on the Iraqi declaration and the advantages of allowing Dr Blix time
to make the first formal response with Dr Rice.66 They also discussed the need to avoid
“the prospect of a protracted game of hide and seek, waiting to see whether Saddam
could be caught out, or whether he would make a mistake”.
215.  Sir David recorded that the US Administration was “now thinking hard about what
might constitute triggers” and asked the FCO for advice on that before a telephone call
between Mr Blair and President Bush the following week.
216.  On 5 December, Mr Straw told Cabinet that the Iraqi declaration was “likely to be
lengthy” and “designed to show dissension inside the United Nations”.67 It was “unlikely
to be fully compliant”. The weapons inspectorates should be “encouraged to make a
proper assessment”.
217.  No further discussion on Iraq was recorded.
218.  The FCO advised on 6 December that there was no agreement in the Security
Council on precise criteria for what would constitute a material breach. Each case
would need to be considered in the light of circumstances.
219.  The FCO position was increasingly shifting from a single specific
incident demonstrating a material breach to the need to establish a pattern of

non‑co‑operation over time demonstrating that Iraq had no intention of complying
with its obligations.
220.  Following its advice of 15 and 29 November, Mr Straw’s Private Office responded
on 6 December to Sir David Manning’s request for further advice on what would
constitute a “trigger” for action.68
221.  The FCO stated that a material breach could not “be a minor violation but must
be a violation of a provision essential to achieving the object or purpose of the original
Gulf War [1991] cease-fire”. That position had been reflected in Mr Straw’s remarks in
the House of Commons on 25 November. The FCO expected most members of the
Security Council to take a similar view.
222.  Consistent with the advice sent to Sir David on 15 and 29 November, the FCO
wrote that there were two broad areas where Iraqi behaviour could amount to a
material breach:

•	

•	

Non‑compliance with its disarmament obligations – if Iraq concealed WMD.
Evidence might take the form of discovery of WMD material not included in the
declaration or evidence which Iraq could not satisfactorily explain which clearly
pointed to a concealed WMD programme (e.g. a yellowcake receipt).
Non‑co‑operation with UNMOVIC/IAEA – if Iraq’s behaviour demonstrated
that it had no intention of co‑operating fully with UNMOVIC in fulfilling its
mandate under resolution 1441 (2002) or other relevant resolutions. Evidence
might comprise a single incident such as denying access to a particular site,
information or personnel. Evidence of coaching witnesses or smuggling
information out of potential sites would be “pretty damning”. Attempts to impede
the removal and destruction of WMD or related material would be potentially a
material breach.

223.  The FCO view was that there would be no need for “a single specific instance”.
A “pattern of lower level incidents” could amount to a demonstration of non‑co‑operation
sufficiently serious to constitute a material breach. Indications of concealment could
include “a series of unanswered questions identified by UNMOVIC/IAEA which
suggested a concealed WMD programme” or “failure … to demonstrate convincingly
that the WMD material identified by UNSCOM in 1998 had been destroyed and properly
accounted for”. “Much would depend on the circumstances and whether the incidents
demonstrated deliberate non‑co‑operation rather than inefficiency or confusion.”
224.  The FCO concluded that there were:
“… bound to be grey areas over whether Iraqi failures are sufficiently serious to
constitute a material breach. There is no agreement in the Council on the precise
criteria. We would need in each case to look at the particular circumstances.
68 

Letter McDonald to Manning, 6 December 2002, ‘Iraq: Material Breach’.

41

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Moreover, some incidents of non‑compliance may be susceptible to remedial action
by UNMOVIC/IAEA (e.g. by destroying weapons etc). In such cases, those seeking
to trigger enforcement action would need to explain how such action would be
necessary to enforce Iraqi compliance.”
225.  When Dr Blix briefed members of the Security Council on 6 December, the Council
decided to make UNMOVIC “the depository of the declaration” and asked UNMOVIC
and the IAEA to “review it immediately, with their experts and from the standpoint of
existing international treaties, for any areas in the declaration that may contribute to
proliferation, or be sensitive, in order to assure confidentiality of that information”.69
Members of the Council would meet the following week to decide on the further handling
of the declaration. The declaration would “not be available for some days until this
procedure is carried out and mechanical/logistical arrangements are made”.

JIC Assessment, 6 December 2002: ‘Iraq: Military Options’
226.  A JIC assessment of Iraq’s military options on 6 December confirmed that
a massive ground force would be required to be certain of toppling Saddam
Hussein and highlighted the possibility of Iraqi attacks on Coalition Forces.
227.  At the request of the MOD, the JIC evaluated Iraq’s military capabilities and its
military options and issued an Assessment on 6 December.70
228.  In the JIC discussion on 4 December, the draft Assessment was described as
“an important paper which highlighted the gaps in our knowledge”.71 The judgements
were based “largely on a mixture of observation and past experience”, but the draft
Assessment “did not quite do justice to the intelligence”; the judgements “could be
made more confidently”. The Assessment needed to bring out more clearly the risks of
a phased attack and unpack the risks involved in possible scenarios, such as the use
of CBW before Coalition Forces were properly assembled and urban fighting: “Nothing
short of a massive deployment would guarantee overthrowing the regime.”
229.  The JIC’s Key Judgements included:

•	
•	

Saddam Hussein would “initially seek international pressure to halt Coalition
[military] action”. If that failed, he would “seek to inflict serious casualties on
Iraq’s neighbours and on Coalition Forces”.
A ground attack might fracture Saddam’s regime, but only a massive Coalition
force was guaranteed to topple him. The smaller the initial Coalition force, the
more likely Iraqi forces were to resist. A phased Coalition attack could allow Iraq
to claim military successes.

Iraqi responses to military action might include “seizing hostages as ‘human
shields’; using non‑lethal BW in a deniable manner; suicide attacks; or a
scorched earth policy with the aim of creating humanitarian or environmental
catastrophe. At some point, motivated by revenge, Saddam would seek to inflict
the maximum damage on his enemies, whether Iraqi or outsiders.”72

230.  The Assessment of the military options is addressed in Section 6.1.
231.  The statements on Iraq’s WMD capabilities and intentions are addressed in
Section 4.3.

Iraq’s declaration, 7 December 2002
232.  Iraq’s declaration was provided to the Security Council on 7 December 2002.
233.  The Iraqi declaration was detailed and technical, written in a combination of
English, Russian and Arabic, with approximately 7,000 pages dealing with ballistic
missile projects.73 A backlog of semi‑annual declarations of activity, covering the
period 1998‑2002 which Iraq had already provided to UNMOVIC, was not then available
to the UK.
234.  On 8 December, the President of the Security Council issued a statement
recording that:
“After consulting with the members of the Security Council, the Presidency decided
to allow access to the Iraqi declaration to those members with the expertise
to assess the risks of proliferation and other sensitive information to begin its
immediate review.
“This review will be in close co‑ordination and consultation with … UNMOVIC and
the … IAEA, and will assist them in producing a working version of the declaration
as soon as possible.”74
235.  In a statement issued on 8 December, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
that “Iraq’s timely submission of its declaration, parallel to its continuing co‑operation
with the international weapons inspectors, confirms its commitment to act in compliance
with resolution 1441”.75

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

237.  In an interview for the Financial Times published on its website on 9 December,
Mr Blair was reported to have stated that war with Iraq was “plainly not inevitable”
if Saddam Hussein complied, but:
“… you would have to be somewhat naive not to be sceptical about the likelihood of
his compliance, given his past history … If he fails to co‑operate, either in any false
declaration or in refusing access to the sites, or interviewing witnesses, or any of the
rest of it, then that is a breach. And in those circumstances, my understanding is that
the United Nations are very clear that there should [be] action.
“As for a second resolution, we said we would go back for a discussion …
“We want to do this with the maximum international support and I believe that
support will be there … in my view it is clear and right that if Saddam is in breach
then we have to impose by conflict, that which we would have preferred to impose
by the will of the UN and the inspectors.”76
238.  Asked if he was saying he did not need a second resolution to take military action,
Mr Blair replied:
“If we get to a situation … where there is a clear breach and … someone puts an
unreasonable block … on it [action] … as we have seen before … over Kosovo you
cannot say there are no set of circumstances in which you would ever refuse to act,
because in my view if he breaches and the UN does nothing, then the authority of
the UN is then hugely weakened. But I don’t believe that will happen.
“I believe that at the heart of that UN resolution is really a deal … which said …
the US and the UK and those who feel really strongly about the threat that Saddam
and weapons of mass destruction pose, they are prepared to go the UN route, to
bring everyone together … we will put in the inspectors and give him the chance
to comply. We’ll go back to the UN route as the way of enforcing this, then the quid
pro quo is … if he then having been given the chance to do the right thing does the
wrong thing, we are not going to walk away from it.”
239.  Mr Blair also emphasised the threat posed by WMD and the “enormous” potential
for them to “fall into the hands of either unstable states or terrorist groups”.
240.  During a discussion of the deficiencies in Iraq’s declaration between Mr Straw and
Secretary Powell on 11 December, and in response to probing about the statement that
“a deficient declaration would be enough” to warrant action, Mr Straw told Secretary
Powell that he did not think Mr Blair had “gone beyond the well rehearsed UK lines on
two resolutions”.77

241.  On 9 December, the FCO issued the formal request seeking Lord Goldsmith’s
advice on whether a further decision by the Security Council would be required
before force could be used to secure Iraq’s compliance with its disarmament
obligations.
242.  The request stated that Lord Goldsmith’s advice was not needed “now”.
243.  The content of the letter from Mr Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser, to
Lord Goldsmith78 and the meeting held at Lord Goldsmith’s request with No.10 officials
on 19 December,79 are addressed in Section 5.
244.  Mr Blair was advised on 11 December that there was impatience in the US
Administration and it “looked intent on military action in February/March”.
245.  There was a need to build “the strongest possible case” that Saddam
Hussein was in material breach of his obligations and “the widest possible
international support for action” through a second resolution.
246.  Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove had a joint meeting with Dr Rice and
Mr George Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, in Washington on 9 December.80
247.  Sir David reported to Mr Blair that Dr Rice had “clearly been provoked” by Saddam
Hussein’s “challenge that it was up to us to prove he had WMD rather than up to him to
prove he did not”. She was:
“… confident that the [Iraqi] declaration would be a sham. The [US] Administration
would in due course declare it deficient and say that Saddam was in material
breach. But she again accepted that this would not amount to a casus belli.”
248.  Dr Rice had “made no effort to hide the fact that the Administration would now be
looking to build the case for early military action … probably mid/late February as we
suspected”. But she had:
“… denied that military planning was dictating the timetable. The need to resolve
the crisis quickly was dictated by political factors. Internally … President [Bush] was
being ‘griddled’. Externally, the international community … would soon lose their
nerve if they began to doubt our determination to impose disarmament on Saddam
if he did not disarm himself. And if we let the inspections process run, and Blix found
nothing as was only too likely, the Russians, French and others would deride US and
UK claims … leaving us exposed and Saddam strengthened.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

249.  Sir David reported that he had been clear about Mr Blair’s determination that
Saddam Hussein had to disarm or be disarmed; he was “obliged to co‑operate” and
if he didn’t, “he would be in breach and military action would follow”.
250.  Sir David said that Iraq’s declaration should be handled in a way “calculated to
maintain Coalition support and to try to secure a second resolution”. He thought that was
possible, but Dr Rice’s.
“… impatience for action was much more obvious than her commitment to secure
international backing. She wanted to know what I thought would constitute material
breach, and how we could catch Saddam out if he did not trap himself through his
own mistakes.”
251.  Sir David told Dr Rice that some cases would be straightforward, such as:
“… the discovery of VX, anthrax, or a nuclear programme … But it would be much
more difficult if we were dogged by a series of low‑level and less clear‑cut acts of
obstruction … We would then be in a grey area where it would be much harder to
persuade the international community to act.”
252.  Sir David stated that the UK needed “a convincing case based on evidence. Public
defiance by Saddam was not the same as proving non‑compliance.” The US and UK
“should work hard over the next couple of months to build our case and secure a second
resolution”. That would comprise three strands of action:

•	
•	
•	

Analysing the declaration: “If Saddam failed to address the discrepancies
identified by UNSCOM … would immediately have a powerful argument that the
declaration was false and incomplete”.
“the smoking gun: it was unlikely but not impossible, that we would acquire
intelligence that caught Saddam red‑handed …” Dr Rice thought the chances
of that were “very slim”.
“Pattern of deceit”: building up “a comprehensive picture of Saddam’s
obstruction and deception. This would consist of the steady accumulation of
examples that might be small in themselves but would be telling when taken
together”.

253.  Dr Rice had agreed the US and UK should pursue those strands and:
“… would like to go to the Security Council around the end of January or early
February to make the case that Saddam was not co‑operating and the time had
come for military action.”
254.  Before that, Mr Blair and President Bush “should meet to review the evidence and
the options”.
255.  Sir David wrote that Dr Rice was “very irritated” about Dr Blix’s reluctance to
interview key individuals outside Iraq, and she was “impervious to arguments” that those

46

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

identified might refuse because of fear for their lives or those of their families. If Dr Blix
would not use the powers in resolution 1441, he would “have to go”.
256.  Sir David reported that he had also “raised the question of British energy
companies”. He “hoped they would be treated fairly and not overlooked if Saddam left
the scene and new oil and gas concessions were being allocated”.
257.  Dr Rice had responded that:
“… it would be particularly unjust if those energy companies who had observed
the sanctions regime …. were not among the beneficiaries in a post‑Saddam Iraq.
She knew UK companies belonged in this category.”
258.  Sir David concluded:
“Condi’s mood has hardened substantially since the NATO Prague Summit in favour
of early military action. (This may be fuelled by a President who is increasingly
uncomfortable with pressure inside the Republican Party, and riled by Saddam’s
taunts). She does not expect the inspections process to produce conclusive
(perhaps not even convincing) evidence. This is prompting her insistence that
we must make clear that the burden of proof is on Saddam, not us … From this
evidence I think there is a real risk that the Administration will overdo the pressure
on Blix: they might force him into resignation with damaging repercussions …
“The mood of the Administration could shift again. But on present form they look
intent on military action in February/March. We need to ensure that they use the next
two to three months to build the strongest possible case that Saddam is in material
breach; and then secure the widest possible international coalition of support for
action expressed through a second … resolution. We are in for a tough few weeks.
Your influence with Bush will be critical.”
259.  Sir David recommended:

•	
•	
•	
•	

co‑ordinating US and UK reactions to the Iraqi declaration and asking pointed
questions exposing its shortcomings, “putting the onus on Saddam to explain
and justify”;
impressing on Dr Blix the need for a “robust and energetic inspections regime,
including a programme of interview” while discouraging the US Administration
from putting such pressure on him that he “denounces them and/or resigns”;
making “maximum efforts to find a smoking gun”, ideally “a top level defector …
willing to testify publicly about Saddam’s WMD programme. Sir Richard
Dearlove and Mr Tenet were “on the case”;
building up “the dossier on Saddam’s pattern of deception and obstruction,
eg pieces of intelligence showing that he is moving equipment around, has
destroyed documentation, etc”; and

•	

“consider an early, steadying phone call from you to Bush; and pencil in a
January meeting between you.”

260.  During a meeting with Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce to discuss military planning on
11 December (see Section 6.1), Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove also
briefed Mr Blair on their recent visits to Washington and “on UK attempts to secure
credible evidence that the Iraqi WMD declaration was false.81
261.  Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair:
“… said that we needed to analyse the Iraqi declaration, ask pointed questions
about issues which the declaration failed to deal with … encourage Blix to ask these
questions of the Iraqis too, and continue to work on securing credible evidence that
Saddam was pursuing WMD programmes.”
262.  Mr Blair would speak to President Bush and possibly Dr Blix in the next few days.
263.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] and David Manning were just back from the US and
they reported the mood there was far tougher. They [the US] felt Saddam was just
messing about and that Blix was hopeless and too soft.”82
264.  In preparation for a conversation with President Bush, Mr Stephen Pattison, Head
of the FCO United Nations Department, provided advice on key messages for Mr Blair.83
265.  The FCO messages were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

We’re working fast on analysing the declaration and identifying discrepancies
between it and our intelligence.
We should not rush to a final judgement. It will be worth taking a little time
to build the best possible case against Iraq.
The UK would adopt a sceptical tone when Dr Blix briefed the Security Council
on 19 December.
The onus was on Iraq to demonstrate it was co‑operating fully and UNMOVIC
should be encouraged to push hard. Access to information would be crucial.
The UK should help UNMOVIC to identify personnel who might be able to
provide relevant information.
An omission in the declaration would not “by itself” constitute a material breach.
It was “much more likely that we shall be able to establish a material breach over

indicate that Iraq has no intention of full co‑operation … We need to encourage
UNMOVIC to keep careful data to establish whether there is a pattern of Iraqi
behaviour indicating they have no intention of complying”.
It would be important to keep the Security Council united, but that would
“not be easy”.

266.  Cabinet on 12 December was told that the Security Council had decided that Iraq’s
declaration had to be scrutinised before it was made available to a wider audience to
ensure that particularly sensitive information had been excised.84 An initial discussion
of the declaration was expected the following week.
267.  Mr Peter Gooderham, Political Counsellor in the British Embassy Washington,
reported on 12 December that a US official had told him that he expected the US
Administration to decide “probably sometime in mid‑January, to lay it on the line that Iraq
had ‘one last chance’ to co‑operate”.85 This would be accompanied by “an increasingly
overt military build up from early January”. Additional measures for putting pressure
on Saddam Hussein were also being considered. The US Administration was also
considering a public presentation of the evidence against Iraq.
268.  The letter was seen by Sir David Manning.86
269.  Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, advised Sir David Manning on
13 December that the Iraqi declaration was “largely based on material already presented
to the UN”, and that:
“There appears to have been no attempt to answer any of the unresolved questions
highlighted by UNSCOM or refute any of the points made in the UK or US
dossiers.”87
270.  The absence of new material was described as “striking, particularly in relation
to the biological weapons programme, where UNSCOM have described previous Iraqi
FFCDs as deficient in all areas”. The DIS had also clarified that Iraq had “only previously
admitted to testing VX in aerial munitions, not to any other weaponisation”.
JIC ASSESSMENT, 13 DECEMBER 2002
271.  A JIC Assessment issued on 13 December warned that any US‑led action
against Iraq and a subsequent occupation was one of many issues that could
draw large numbers to Islamist extremist ideology over the next five years.
272.  The Assessment is addressed in the Box below.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

JIC Assessment, 13 December 2002: ‘International
Terrorism: The Next Five Years’
At the request of the Cabinet Office, the JIC assessed the threat from international
terrorism over the next five years, to inform the UK’s counter‑terrorism strategy, on
11 December.88
The minutes record that the points made in discussion included:

•	

The paper needed to make a firmer judgement about whether the threat from
terrorism would diminish or increase. For instance, “would the terrorists up the
ante … by attempting to use CBRN [chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear]
weapons”?

•	

“The paper should make more of the possible links between terrorist groups and
the loose network of WMD suppliers.”

•	

In relation to prospects for 2007, the paper should “stress the likelihood of
mutation of the threat, and highlight linkages to regional political factors,
particularly in the Middle East”.

The JIC Assessment judged that Al Qaida would continue to attempt mass effect attacks,
and that “Attacks using chemical/biological materials within the next five years are almost
inevitable.”89
The JIC also judged that Al Qaida might “develop radiological dispersal devices or, less
likely, improvised nuclear devices” and that “Technology, expertise and materiel could be
acquired from state programmes.”
The JIC assessed that “Strong Coalition measures in the campaign against terrorism”
would “further radicalise at least some young Muslims. Many issues could draw large
numbers to the Islamist extremist ideology over the next five years, including US‑led
action against Iraq and a subsequent occupation.”
The Assessment stated: “Major political change in countries like Iraq [... and others] could
place elements of state CBRN programmes at the disposal of Al Qaida.”
The JIC sustained its Assessment that the UK would “remain a priority Al Qaida target”.
Sir David Omand, the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary and Security and Intelligence
co‑ordinator from June 2002 to April 2005, told the Inquiry:
“On 13 December 2002, we warned that US‑led action could draw large numbers
to the Islamist extremist ideology over the following five years …”90

273.  Following Mr Blair’s meeting with Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President, on
13 December, in the margins of the European Council, Sir David Manning reported that
President Chirac:
“… had sounded sceptical about the need for military action in Iraq. He would only
support this if Saddam made a huge mistake.”91
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 16 DECEMBER 2002
274.  Following Iraq’s declaration, Mr Blair concluded that it was hard to see how
conflict could be avoided unless Saddam Hussein started to behave honestly.
275.  On 15 December, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the Iraqi declaration
and the need for “hard, on‑the‑ground evidence” to secure international support for
military action.92 They also discussed “flood[ing] the zone with intelligence driven
inspections”, and an article by Harlan Ullman in the Washington Post which had
“correctly” made the point that “if you don’t find anything, then there can be no
casus belli”.
276.  Mr Blair sent a note to officials in No.10 on 16 December.93
277.  On Iraq, Mr Blair wrote that the Iraqi declaration was “plainly inconsistent with
our intelligence. The test will be to prove it is false.” Mr Blair asked for a report on
Dr Blix’s “modus operandi” and to see him later that week or in early January if that
were possible.
278.  Mr Blair wrote:
“We also need to build on the whole issue of WMD and show its importance.
AC [Alastair Campbell] to do a communications note on this, amplifying his earlier
one this weekend. But studying the Iraqi declaration, it is hard to see how conflict
can be avoided, unless Saddam starts to behave honestly. My sense of Russia and
France is that albeit reluctantly, they accept this and will support a new resolution if
the breach by Saddam is clear and significant.”
279.  Mr Campbell’s response on 19 December is addressed later in this Section.
280.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair to warn President Bush not to rush to
a final judgement. Time would be needed to build the “strongest possible case”
against Iraq, and to secure a second resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

281.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that he should make the following points in his
discussion with President Bush:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The declaration was a “sham” which they should expose in the debate in the
Security Council later that week.
“We should build up the strongest possible case over the next few weeks. Try
to find the smoking gun. Tough but may not be impossible.” A defector “ready
to give details of Saddam’s WMD programme” would be better than in country
interviews.
“In addition we need to piece together comprehensive picture of Iraqi obstruction
and deception to demonstrate pattern of deceit.”
“Do everything possible to maintain international coalition you skilfully built.
If there is a clear material breach, believe we can get a second resolution …”
The UK’s military preparations were “beginning to become more public”. The
US and UK military chiefs needed “to keep in very close step”.94

282.  Mr Blair told President Bush on 16 December that the Iraqi declaration was
“patently false”.
283.  Mr Blair was “cautiously optimistic” that the inspectors would find proof.
Sir Richard Dearlove was pursuing that.
284.  Mr Blair suggested that he and President Bush should take stock in January.
285.  Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 16 December.95
286.  Mr Blair commented that the Iraqi declaration “was patently false. We now needed
proof that demonstrated it.” He and President Bush discussed the need to put the
burden of truth on Saddam Hussein, how much time he should be allowed, and the need
to avoid a loss of momentum.
287.  Mr Blair said that military preparations should continue. He did not think that
Saddam Hussein would co‑operate. He was “cautiously optimistic that the inspectors
might find proof that the declaration was false. We needed something or someone who
was in some way involved.” Sir Richard Dearlove was pursuing that with Mr Tenet.
288.  Mr Blair was “hopeful that this strategy would work; we should take stock
in January if it was”.

SIR RICHARD DEARLOVE’S VISIT TO WASHINGTON, DECEMBER 2002
289.  During a visit to Washington in mid‑December, Sir Richard Dearlove
emphasised the need for sufficient evidence to make a convincing case that Iraq
had failed to abide by resolution 1441.
290.  During a discussion on 15 December, Sir Richard Dearlove told his interlocutor
that his impression from his meeting with Mr Blair on 11 December was that “HMG
would need clear evidence beyond an audit of the Iraqi declaration, to commit to
military action”.96
291.  Sir Richard reported a view that President Bush was relying on Mr Blair’s
assurances that HMG would be with the US.
292.  The report sent to Sir David Manning recorded that Sir Richard had discussed the
Iraq declaration and the need for a “road map” setting out the next steps with a number
of US officials.97
293.  Sir Richard had told one US official that, in addition to setting out clearly and
persuasively that Iraq had failed to abide by resolution 1441:
“… we needed to continue on parallel tracks designed to reinforce the case, and for
HMG, to give the PM sufficient evidence of a breach which the declaration by itself
did not. We needed:

•	
•	
•	
•	

a detailed audit of the declaration
to press the interview issue or force Saddam’s refusal to co‑operate
to prepare for the release of intelligence to prove deception
to press on with a rigorous inspection regime absent a ‘silver‑bullet’.”

294.  Sir Richard had said that “perhaps by the end of January all those elements
would have produced sufficient evidence to make the convincing case we needed”.
A “convincing defector or a revealing site inspection” would be preferable, “but we could
not depend on this”. He added later that “success was far from guaranteed”.
295.  In a separate conversation with another official, Sir Richard Dearlove had said that
he “estimated the chance of a successful operation to produce a defector or a smoking
gun at about 20 percent”.
296.  In a manuscript comment to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning wrote that “we should
go flat out” to find a defector or evidence in a site inspection.98

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

297.  Mr Blair replied: “absolutely”.99
298.  In relation to the estimate that the chance of a successful operation to produce a
defector or a smoking gun was about 20 percent, Mr Powell commented: “Not good”.100
299.  On the description of a discussion about a possible presentation of intelligence
“when conflict was inevitable”, including overhead photographs of material being moved
and intercepts of conversations about deception operations, Mr Blair wrote “but can’t this
be used to convince Blix?”101
300.  A separate copy of the report was sent to Mr Straw’s Private Office
on 19 December.
MR STRAW’S STATEMENT, 18 DECEMBER 2002
301.  In a statement issued on 18 December Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein
had decided to continue the pretence that Iraq had no WMD programme. If he
persisted “in this obvious falsehood” it would become clear that he had “rejected
the pathway to peace”.
302.  Mr Straw issued a statement on 18 December stating:
“We have not yet completed a full analysis. But it is clear, even on a preliminary
assessment, that it is not the full and complete declaration requested … and we
wish to hear the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA.
“There are some obvious omissions … And it seems that Saddam Hussein has
decided to continue the pretence that Iraq has had no WMD programme since
UNSCOM left in 1998.
“This will fool nobody. If Saddam persists in this obvious falsehood, it will become
clear that he has rejected the pathway to peace laid down in resolution 1441.
“… we have always said that we would want the declaration tested by hard
questions and robust inspections. As that process continues, we will complete
a full analysis of the Iraqi documents.
“Saddam can be in no doubt by now that resolution 1441 offers him the final
opportunity to comply honestly and openly.”102

PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 18 DECEMBER 2002
303.  Mr Blair continued to express scepticism about whether Saddam Hussein
would comply with resolution 1441; and to emphasise that the UK would if
necessary disarm him by force.
304.  During Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 18 December Mr Iain Duncan
Smith, Leader of the Opposition, asked Mr Blair when the Government would make a
formal response to the Iraqi declaration and whether he agreed that Secretary Powell’s
scepticism was well founded.103 Mr Blair replied that the Government would respond
“shortly after the Christmas break”; “most people” were “pretty sceptical”, but it was
important to study the Iraqi declaration in detail and make a considered response.
305.  In response to a question from Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal
Democrats, about military deployments, and a reported comment by Mr Hoon that the
Security Council would not be the final judge of whether military action was necessary,
Mr Blair stated:
“… resolution 1441 assumes that there will be a further discussion in the UN
Security Council … [I]t has always been our desire to act with the full authority of
the … Council. We have always made it clear, however, that, if there were a breach
and if, for any reason, the Security Council were blocked in any way, we do not
believe it right that that breach should go unpunished … [I]t is important to make
sure that we do our level best to work with the UN in any way that we can, but the
bottom line – as I have set out from the very beginning – must be that the United
Nations route must be the way of dealing with the issue, not the way of avoiding
dealing with it … I believe that the UN will support action in circumstances where
there has been a breach.”104
306.  Mr Kennedy also asked if the Government would back the US if it decided to take
any “pre‑emptive unilateral action” before the UN inspectorate had completed its task
and submitted its conclusions and recommendations to the Security Council. Mr Blair
replied that the US was “bound by the UN resolution, just as we are”, and reiterated
the points he had made to the Financial Times on 10 December about the nature of the
“deal” in resolution 1441.
307.  Subsequently, in response to a question from Mr Andrew Selous (Conservative)
asking for a “clearer explanation” of whether the purpose of a “possible war” in Iraq
was “to protect Iraq’s citizens and neighbours from Saddam, to enhance UN authority,
or to protect Britain from a future missile attack or Iraqi‑sponsored terrorism, Mr Blair
responded that those factors were not “mutually inconsistent”:
“The reasons for being prepared to take action … are, first, that Saddam has
weapons of mass destruction that threaten his region … if a conflict took place

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

there involving weapons of mass destruction, it is unthinkable that we would not be
involved in some way, as we were 10 years ago.
“Secondly, it is important because there is a UN resolution … that Saddam must
give up those weapons … [I]f … we were to allow Saddam to breach the UN will
and did nothing about it, the consequences would be felt not just in respect of Iraq.
We would send a message across the world that this was a serious issue, but one
about which we were prepared to do nothing … We are members of the international
community and we believe it is important that Britain make sure that Saddam
complies with those UN resolutions. That is why Britain has a vital national interest in
ensuring that the resolution is implemented.”105
MR HOON’S STATEMENT, 18 DECEMBER 2002
308.  Mr Hoon told Parliament on 18 December that the UK was making
contingency preparations, including the deployment of a naval Task Group
for exercises; and that there might be additional maritime deployments in the
New Year.
309.  In a statement to Parliament on 18 December on contingency preparations for
military operations against Iraq, Mr Hoon reported that he had “authorised a range of
steps to improve readiness”.106 He also referred to the planned deployment of a naval
Task Group, led by HMS Ark Royal, to the Gulf and Asia‑Pacific region, in early 2003,
which remained “available for a range of potential operations if required”.
310.  Mr Hoon added that the UK was also considering the deployment of “additional
maritime forces early in the new year to ensure the readiness of a broad range of
maritime capabilities, should they be required”.
311.  The development of plans for a possible UK contribution to US‑led military action
after Mr Blair’s decision at the end of October to offer ground forces to the US for
planning purposes, and discussions with the US, are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.

JIC Assessment, 18 December 2002
312.  The JIC’s initial Assessment on 18 December of the Iraqi declaration
stated that:

•	
•	

105 
106 

Intelligence from late November indicated that Iraq’s aim was to overload
UNMOVIC with information.
Iraq “continued to claim that it has not conducted any illicit WMD or
ballistic missile programmes since 1991”.

•	

There had been “No serious attempt” to answer any of the unresolved
questions highlighted by UNSCOM or to refute any of the points made
in the UK dossier on Iraq’s WMD programme.

313.  The JIC Assessment addressed the substance of the issues, but the
judgement that Iraq had made no attempt to deal with the points in the dossier
made the dossier a test for Iraq.
314.  That was not its purpose. It was for the UN not the UK to define the bar
for Iraq.
315.  An ‘Initial DIS Assessment’ of Iraq’s declaration, based on an analysis of the text
provided in English and a partial but continuing translation of the key sections written
in Arabic, was produced on 16 December.107
316.  On 18 December, the JIC discussed a draft Assessment, supported by the DIS
analysis of 16 December.108
317.  Comments recorded in the minutes of the discussion included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

There had been “no significant disagreements of perception or judgement
between the UK and the US”.
The declaration was “surprisingly bad”; virtually none of the issues arising from
the 1999 UNSCOM report had been answered.
Further analysis of the annexes “would be an enormous job”, and the UK “would
have to rely upon seeing the UN translation of much of the Arabic material”.
That text was “unlikely to contain the missing information”.
There would be “a fuller assessment in due course”.

318.  The JIC Assessment, ‘An Initial Assessment of Iraq’s WMD Declaration’, was
issued on 18 December, with the DIS Assessment of 16 December as an Annex.109
319.  The Key Judgements were:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The declaration failed “to address the issues outstanding from UNSCOM’s report
to the UN Security Council in 1999”.
Iraq maintained that it currently had “no proscribed WMD programmes”.
“The majority of information in the declaration” had “already been passed to the
UN in some form”.
“The new material so far found” did “not alter UK assessments of Iraq’s WMD
programmes”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

The declaration made “no attempt to deal with the points made in the
UK dossier”.

320.  The key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.

JIC Assessment, 18 December 2002: ‘An Initial Assessment
of Iraq’s WMD Declaration’
The Assessment rehearsed the UK’s knowledge of Iraq’s production of WMD before 1991
and the material which UNSCOM had been “unable to account for”, and the judgements
in the September dossier.
Intelligence on the declaration
“Intelligence indicated in early November that Iraq was considering a number of options …
including a possible admission of a small proportion of its illegal activity. But by late
November intelligence indicated that Iraq’s declaration would omit references to its
banned weapons and that the aim was to overload UNMOVIC with information.” A senior
Iraqi official was quoted as saying “the declaration would be general and lacking in detail
and had been padded out with various scientific reports and studies”.
Overview
The declaration was “largely based on material already presented to the UN in
previous FFCDs [Full, Final, and Complete Declarations] and other correspondence”.
“No serious attempt” had “apparently been made to answer any of the unresolved
questions highlighted by UNSCOM or to refute any of the points made in the UK dossier”.
Iraq continued to “claim that it has not conducted any illicit WMD or ballistic missile
programmes since 1991”. “Little new material … on the nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons” had been found; there was “some new material” on missiles.
Chemical weapons
The declaration was based on a June 1996 FFCD and additional information provided to
the UN before 1998. Some of that information had not been seen previously by the UK.
As well as the “unaccounted for” quantities of agent, precursors and munitions which
UNSCOM had identified, the declaration did not:

•	

“provide a key document detailing the consumption of special munitions in the
1980s” which had been “removed from UNSCOM by the Iraqis”;

•	

“substantiate Iraq’s denials … that attempts were made to manufacture and
weaponise VX”.

The list of “over 30 sites in which chemical activity” took place was “incomplete”.
Biological weapons
The declaration reiterated information already provided to the UN, which had already been
reviewed. It failed to “provide a technically coherent account of Iraq’s biological weapons
programme”. The declaration provided new material relating to 40 sites which Iraq claimed
had no connection with proscribed activity but which were judged capable of supporting
a BW programme. It did not mention some dual‑use sites previously monitored by
UNSCOM. Names of individuals included in previous declarations on biological weapons

58

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

had been “systematically removed”, although the declaration stated that they would be
“provided to UNMOVIC on request”.
It did not:

•	
•	

“address the issue of unaccounted for growth media”;

•	
•	

“acknowledge any proscribed biological weapons activity post‑1991”; or

“provide fully documented accounts” of the pre‑1991 programmes or “recognition
of the military application”;
“mention … transportable production facilities”.

Nuclear weapons
The declaration was “largely the same as the FFCD” for activity pre‑1991 which had been
issued in 1998, “with a new extended summary”. It was “accurate” but “incomplete”. It
maintained that no weapons‑related work had been undertaken since 1998. It did not
address whether Iraq had been seeking uranium in Africa.
Ballistic missiles
Most of the data provided related to pre‑1991 programmes. The declaration acknowledged
“some facilities established since 1998” and “known from intelligence”. It also provided
“some limited new evidence of proscribed missile development post‑1991”. Two designs
were judged to have ranges greater than the limit of 150km.
The “major omissions” were:

•	
•	

“no attempt to resolve outstanding issues” relating to SCUD missiles;

•	

“no details of recent procurement activity associated with more advanced missile
propellant”.

“no mention of any post‑1998 activity at many missile related facilities, including
the al‑Rafah engine test stand”, which was “capable of testing engines for missiles
with ranges over 1000km”; and

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

•	

The declaration referred to “aborted attempts” to convert an anti‑ship missile into
a land attack weapon with a range of 95km. The JIC judged the “system would be
suitable for chemical and biological delivery”.

•	

The declaration claimed that the L‑29 aircraft was “a target‑drone” and there “was
no mention of a chemical or biological agent delivery capability”. The JIC judged
that Iraq had “more aircraft” and had “conducted more flight tests than stated”; and
that its range was “understated”.

•	

The declaration provided “limited, but new information on two UAV programmes”,
which Iraq claimed had “started after 1998”, that had been included in reports
recently passed to UNMOVIC. They would be “used as target drones”. The JIC
judged that the UAVs “would have a significantly better performance” than claimed
and could be “adapted to chemical and biological agent delivery”.

59

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Conclusion
The JIC concluded that the declaration so far analysed failed to address the outstanding
issues from UNSCOM’s report to the Security Council in 1999 and “made no attempt to
answer any of the points outlined in the UK dossier”. Iraq might:
“… feel they dealt with these points in their previous rebuttal of the dossier. Some of
the deficiencies may be addressed in the parts yet to be translated, but this does not
look likely.”

321.  On 20 December, Mr Miller sent Sir David Manning a further DIS overview of the
Iraqi declaration.110
322.  Mr Miller re‑stated the key findings outlined in the 18 December JIC Assessment
and identified the principal areas of apparent omission. The main new points identified
were:
“•	 an admission by the Iraqis that they have delivered 50 Al Samoud missiles to
their military. The UK dossier stated that at least 50 of these missiles had been
produced and were being deployed to military units;

•	
•	

details of missile related procurement activities post‑1998, which Iraq claims
were for permitted programmes. There are no details concerning the origin of
the material and equipment procured, some of which we judge were obtained
illicitly;
the document fails to cover refurbishment at potential BW sites.”

323.  Mr Miller reported that the DIS would continue to analyse the declaration when
a full English text was available from the UN. That was likely to be after Christmas.
324.  On 18 December, the JIC also discussed a letter of 13 December from Mr Miller
on the cohesion of the Iraqi regime.111
325.  The main point raised was that the fundamental judgement of the JIC of
6 December had not changed, “especially that nothing short of a massive Coalition force
was guaranteed to threaten the regime enough to topple it”. There were, however, “more
areas of pressure building within the regime, although it was still impossible to say how
and when it might fracture”. The Iraqi people’s perceptions of Saddam Hussein’s position
would be “crucial”. The two “tipping points” would be when:

•

Meeting of the US National Security Council,
18 December 2002
In his memoir, War and Decision, Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy, described a meeting of the US National Security Council on 18 December 2002,
at which the US response to Iraq’s declaration was discussed.112
Mr Feith described differences of view between President Bush and other members of
the Council about the position the US Administration should adopt in response to the
discussion of the Iraqi declaration of 7 December in the Security Council on 19 December,
and the impact which describing the declaration as a material breach of resolution 1441
would have.
Mr Feith reported that, after some discussion, President Bush stated that he thought “war
was inevitable”. President Bush was concerned that use of the term material breach would
create an expectation of military action and a debate about whether it was sufficient for the
US to go to war.
Secretary Powell was reported to have taken a different position; and that he had
suggested the US should make its case to the Security Council that Saddam Hussein was
not co‑operating soon after Dr Blix’s report on 27 January 2003.
Mr Feith reported that President Bush had reminded those in the room that the point of the
7 December declaration was to test whether Saddam would accept the “final opportunity”
for peace offered by the Security Council; and that he had summed up the discussion by
stating:
“We’ve got what we need now, to show America that Saddam won’t disarm himself.”

Cabinet, 19 December 2002
327.  In his update to Cabinet on 19 December, Mr Straw suggested that the
Iraqi declaration did not meet the requirements of resolution 1441 and that the
next step would be increased efforts by the inspectors to find the evidence.
The Security Council could be in a position to declare a material breach by
27 January 2003.
328.  Mr Hoon informed Cabinet that preparations were being made to be ready for
possible military action.
329.  Mr Blair promised that there would be an “opportunity to discuss Iraq in the
New Year”.
330.  Mr Straw reported to Cabinet on 19 December that Iraq’s declaration did not look
as “accurate, full and complete as the resolution required”; and that, in particular, it failed
to explain the material which had been “unaccounted for in 1998 such as: 360 tonnes
of bulk chemical warfare agent; 3,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals; growth media

for biological agent production and 30,000 munitions for the delivery of chemical and
biological agents”.113
331.  Mr Straw reminded his colleagues that a false statement did not represent a
material breach, “but it could be a contributing factor”. The next step would be increased
efforts by the inspectors to find the evidence. The inspectors had to report to the UN
Security Council on progress by 27 January. By that time, “the Security Council could be
in a position to declare a material breach”. President Bush would be making his State of
the Union speech on 28 January.
332.  Mr Hoon informed his colleagues that, “to be ready for possible military action”,
it was “increasingly necessary to make visible preparations. Contracts for equipment
would be let; Reservists and their employers would be consulted; the notice to move
for some units would be reduced; and a naval Task Group led by HMS Ark Royal
would depart for exercises.” The US had not yet finalised its military planning but it was
“already building up a formidable force and would be ready to use it”.
333.  Mr Blair said that “there would be an opportunity to discuss Iraq in the New Year”.
334.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Ms Clare Short, the International
Development Secretary, had pointed up the need for more discussion on Iraq.114

Security Council, 19 December 2002
335.  In response to a briefing from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 19 December, the
Security Council agreed to a further discussion early the following month, after
members of the Council had completed their analytical work.
336.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported overnight on 17/18 December that Dr Blix would
tell the Security Council on 19 December that it could not have confidence that the
declaration “disposed of” the question of Iraq’s WMD holdings but that he could not say
Iraq definitely had WMD; there was more work to do and the ball was in Iraq’s court.115
337.  On 17 and 18 December, Secretary Powell and Mr Straw discussed the pressure
on the US Administration to say “something strong” (in response to Dr Blix’s briefing to
Members of the Security Council) and the need to catch Iraq “red‑handed”.116
338.  Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei briefed Members of the Security Council on 19 December
on inspections in Iraq and their preliminary assessment of Iraq’s declaration.117

339.  Dr Blix reported on the speed of UNMOVIC’s build‑up of operations in Iraq and
that it had inspected 44 sites, including eight newly declared locations.118 Access to the
sites, including those previously designated by Iraq as sensitive or Presidential, had
been “prompt”, and assistance had been “expeditious”. The location of artillery shells
and containers with mustard gas, which had been placed under UNSCOM supervision
in 1998, had been identified and they would be sampled and eventually destroyed.
Dr Blix reported that Iraq had formally been asked to submit the names of all personnel
currently or formerly associated with some aspect of Iraq’s programme of weapons
of mass destruction and ballistic missiles by the end of the year; and for legislation
implementing resolutions, notably laws prohibiting engagement in the development,
production or storage of proscribed material.
340.  In his “necessarily provisional” comments on the declaration, Dr Blix stated that
Iraq continued to state that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq when
the inspectors left in December 1998 and that none had “been designed, procured,
produced or stored in the period since then”. While individual Governments had stated
that they had “convincing evidence to the contrary”, UNMOVIC was, at that point,
“neither in a position to confirm Iraq’s statements, nor in possession of evidence to
disprove it”.
341.  During the period between 1991 and 1998, Iraq had submitted many declarations
which had “proved inaccurate or incomplete or was unsupported or contradicted by
evidence”. The statements by Iraq were not sufficient to create confidence that no
weapons programmes and proscribed items remained: the statements needed to be
“supported by documentation or other evidence” which would allow them to be verified.
342.  The overall impression was that “not much new significant information”
had been provided which related to proscribed programmes; nor had “much new
supporting documentation or other evidence been submitted”. Iraq had provided
new information on:

•	
•	
•	

missile activities, including a series of new projects at various stages of
development, which Iraq claimed were permitted;
a short‑range rocket manufactured using 81mm aluminium tubes; and
the “Air Force” document119 relating to the consumption of chemical weapons
in the Iran-Iraq war.

New material had been provided “concerning non‑weapons related activities”.

119 
A document found by an UNSCOM inspector in a safe in Iraqi Air Force headquarters in 1998. It gave
an account of the expenditure of bombs, including chemical bombs, by Iraq in the Iran‑Iraq war which
raised questions about Iraq’s previous accounts. Iraq had taken the document from the inspector.

343.  There were also inconsistencies and areas which needed clarification, including:

•	
•	

the omission of information on imports of bacterial growth media;

•	

a lack of supporting evidence to address unresolved issues identified in the 1999
UNSCOM and Amorim reports.

declaration of the development of a variant of the Al Samoud missile which had
exceeded the permitted range in test flights; and

344.  In conclusion, Dr Blix stated that, if Iraq failed to provide evidence supporting its
statements, the inspectors could not guarantee that all possibly concealed items and
activities would be found; but they would make attempts at concealment more difficult.
345.  A statement by the President of the Council said that the members had noted the
contents of the briefing and expressed their intention to have a further discussion “early
in January after all members of the Council finish their own analytical work” and more
regular briefings from UNMOVIC and the IAEA.120
346.  In his remarks to the Security Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock drew on the
statement issued by Mr Straw on 18 December. He gave examples of weapons and
materials which had not been accounted for in the declaration and added that:
“The declaration fell well short of providing compelling evidence that Iraq wishes to
establish a new co‑operative relationship with UNMOVIC and the Council. On the
contrary, it suggested that Iraq had no intention of complying with SCR 1441, or
taking the pathway to peace laid down in that resolution. We wanted to see … the
discrepancies probed rigorously … In short, we were very disappointed that Iraq had
not taken the 1441 opportunity. I would not speculate what this meant. But Iraq now
had to be 100 percent pro‑active in co‑operating with the inspectors in accounting
for every remaining doubt. Withholding this quality of co‑operation risked bringing
into play the second part of OP4 of 1441.”121
347.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock also reported that Dr ElBaradei had appealed to Member
States to offer whatever information they had to assist UNMOVIC and the IAEA in
reaching credible conclusions on Iraq’s weapons programmes.
348.  Sir Jeremy described the meeting as a “surprisingly low key affair, largely because
the non‑permanents had only had the declaration for 36 hours”. Some of them were
insisting that they see the un‑excised version.
349.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had told the press that there was little new
evidence in the declaration and what was new generally related to non‑weapons
programmes. Iraq was co‑operating on process but much more was needed on

substance. There were open questions which had not been answered with evidence.
Iraq had missed an opportunity in its declaration, but could still provide information.
350.  Mr Campbell recorded that Mr Blair was “worried about Blix’s comments that
we had not been helping enough with the intelligence”.122
351.  Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence, advised
Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on 19 December that the UK was passing intelligence
to UNMOVIC but “We had not found a silver bullet yet.”123
352.  Mr Straw issued a statement which said that the declaration failed to meet
Iraq’s obligations and that there could not, therefore, be any confidence in Iraq’s
claims that it had no WMD.
353.  In a statement issued after the reports to the Security Council, Mr Straw said that
they showed:
“… clearly that Iraq has failed to meet the obligations imposed on it by Security
Council resolution 1441, which requires them to make a full and complete disclosure
of their weapons of mass destruction … as Dr Blix has said, this means that we
cannot have confidence … to put it very mildly – that Iraq has no weapons of
mass destruction as it has claimed. This now means that Iraq faces even greater
responsibilities to comply fully with the inspectors and co‑operate fully with the
United Nations if military action is to be avoided. This disclosure does not of itself
trigger military action … but it is a very serious failure to comply, and a clear warning
has to go out to Iraq that they now have to co‑operate fully with the United Nations
and its inspectors as is required of them by international law.”124
354.  Secretary Powell warned that Iraq was “well on its way to losing its last
chance”, and that there was a “practical limit” to how long the inspectors could
be given to complete their work.
355.  Secretary Powell gave a press conference on 19 December stating that the Iraqi
declaration did not address Iraq’s stockpiles or supplies of chemical and biological
agents and the procurement and use of high‑strength aluminium tubes that can be used
in a nuclear weapons programme: “Most brazenly of all, the Iraqi declaration denies
the existence of any prohibited weapons programs at all.”125 There was a “pattern of
systematic holes and gaps”. The US was “disappointed, but … not deceived … On the

basis of this declaration, on the basis of the evidence before us, our path for the coming
weeks is clear.”
356.  Secretary Powell proposed a four‑step approach in the coming weeks to:

•	
•	
•	
•	

audit and examine the Iraqi declaration “to understand the full extent of Iraq’s
failure to meet its disclosure obligations”;
conduct interviews with scientists and other witnesses outside Iraq;
intensify UN inspectors’ efforts inside Iraq; and
consult the Security Council and US allies on how to compel Iraq to comply with
the terms of the resolution.

357.  Secretary Powell stated that the United States, and he hoped other Council
members, would “provide the inspectors with every possible assistance, all the support
they need to succeed in their crucial mission”. Resolution 1441 had called for “serious
consequences for Iraq” if it did not comply. So far, Iraq was “well on its way to losing its
last chance”. There was “no calendar deadline”, but there was “a practical limit to how
much longer you can just go down the road of non‑co‑operation and how much time the
inspectors can be given to do their work … This situation cannot continue.”
358.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell had spoken before the press conference about
Mr Straw’s remarks on the BBC’s Today programme earlier that day. Mr Straw said
that he had “repeated [the] long standing position that [the UK] would prefer a second
resolution, with the usual Kosovo caveats”.126
359.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell also discussed the need for the White House
to be clear about Mr Blair’s position.
360.  In a letter to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, Mr Ehrman wrote:
“With the American military machine now increasingly set on auto‑pilot towards war,
the nightmare scenario of the UK having to decide whether to join US military action
without a second SCR is only made more likely …”127
361.  Sir Christopher Meyer reported on 19 December that there was “some fairly
intensive kremlinology going on in the White House about the British political scene …
What did Tony Blair need to be able comfortably to go to war?”.128 The current US view
“which could change, was that a second SCR was attainable”. Sir Christopher had told
a senior US official that “a spring war looked as close as possible to being inevitable
without actually being inevitable”.

The need for a communications strategy
362.  Mr Campbell advised Mr Blair that a statement would be needed early in
the New Year bringing all the strands of the strategy on Iraq together to set out
the UK Government’s position and to counter the sense that the UK was acting
for America.
363.  Mr Campbell suggested that the statement should communicate the “big
picture” and provide the basis for addressing difficult questions: Why Iraq? Why
now? And why us? That should include the UK’s definition of material breach.
364.  Mr John Williams had written to Mr Campbell on 2 December in response to a
request for “strategic public objectives on Iraq, setting out our aims, and working through
the difficult issues”.129 Mr Williams provided two papers, one on “Public Objectives” for
public use and one on “Media Tactics”. Both had been approved by Mr Straw.
365.  The paper on “public objectives” drew on the strategic objectives agreed
by Mr Blair and sent to Ministers on 22 October (see Section 3.5).
366.  Production of a document setting out the UK objectives and the need to be more
“in control of the agenda” was discussed at meeting of an Iraq Strategy Group chaired
by Mr Campbell on 10 December and subsequently.130
367.  In response to Mr Blair’s request of 16 December, Mr Campbell wrote to
Mr Blair on 19 December setting out the need to explain the UK’s strategy and
seeking Mr Blair’s views.131
368.  Mr Campbell wrote: “Iraq is moving up a gear as an issue and as we enter the
New Year we need to step up our communications efforts.”
369.  Mr Campbell recommended that the objectives approved in October should be
published as soon as Parliament returned on 7 January, with a statement in the House
of Commons from Mr Blair alongside publicity generated by the FCO Heads of Mission
Conference. The statement would set out the strategic framework for the Government’s
overall approach and draw together the diplomatic, political and humanitarian strands
of the strategy on Iraq as well as addressing issues of proliferation and terrorism.
It would “give us all the big picture to communicate and give us a handle for the difficult
questions as we go”.

129 

67

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

370.  Mr Campbell argued that the communications strategy “should be rooted in where
we think we will end up which currently looks like a military conflict that ends in Saddam
falling”. The major steps and key messages envisaged by Mr Campbell were:

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq’s declaration would be “shown to be false – requires strategy which …
emphasises our determination to ensure Saddam Hussein understands … this is
his last chance and that we are trying our hardest to make the process work …
We need to guard against the sense that we are looking for the process to fail,
rather than looking for the process to succeed;”
a “UN discussion” where the tone would be one of “regret that he [Saddam]
failed to take the chance” and with the “UK at heart of coalition building around
key arguments”;
a “Military build up” which moved from the “current argument that ‘sometimes the
only way to avoid conflict is by making it clear willing to use force if necessary’
to ‘we did not want war, but Saddam Hussein has rejected the peaceful path to
disarmament’”;
“Military conflict: This is the last resort. Now we need to get the job done”; and
“Post conflict: We’re there to help for the long term.”

371.  A “specific communications plan for the Iraqi people” was being developed which
would emphasise Iraq’s territorial integrity and make it clear that “we are gunning for
Saddam’s people at the top, not the ‘ordinary’ people”. In Mr Campbell’s view they would
“actually prefer a ‘regime change’ message to a more subtle ‘disarmament’ message”.
372.  Mr Campbell argued that the UK needed a “clear sense of a UK Government
position that is our own … not merely an echo” of the US position and counter the sense
that the UK was acting for America. The UK had to “communicate better the threat and
relevance to the UK”. The UK position “should be that the issue of Iraq/WMD has to be
addressed, we worked hard to get [the] UN route … and we’re working hard to make that
route work. But Saddam has to understand this is his last chance, and in the meantime
we carry on military preparations.”
373.  Mr Campbell wrote that the US tone was “dismissive” on inspections; the UK had
to be deliberative. The UK needed to “set out our own definition of material breach.
The closest we have is Jack [Straw]’s statement that ‘material breach means something
significant: some behaviour or pattern of behaviour which is serious’”. In Mr Campbell’s
view, the media confused “material breach and trigger”.
374.  Other points made by Mr Campbell were that the UK needed to:

•	
•	

“… rebut the ‘poodle charge’ by answering more clearly the questions – Why
Iraq? Why now? And why us?”;
“… put over to the public” that we are in charge of our military preparations,
separate from the Americans, “though obviously linked”. The fact that the US/UK

68

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

•	
•	
•	

had hugely superior military was likely to have the most impact on Iraqi opinion
“so we have agreed MOD should step up their military preparedness briefing”;
rebut negative stories, including the “charge that the conflict is all about oil”;
“… make more of the issue of WMD more generally, and make the link (largely
unbelieved here or in the US) with terrorism. It is a theoretical link, not yet an
actual one, and the US, in continuing to make claims of an actual link, risk being
counter productive”; and
have “better answers to the charge of double standards re Israel, which is the
single biggest impediment to effective communications in the region”.

375.  Mr Campbell concluded that there was “a big job of work to do” which would
“require a lot of input” from Mr Blair and set out a list of potential communications
opportunities in January.
376.  Mr Campbell also set out the arrangements he had put in place to “implement
a major communications strategy, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

a weekly strategy meeting;
daily reviews;
daily US conference calls;
CIC [Communications and Information Centre] reactivated;
excellent output by the Islamic Media Unit;
a small but effective presence in Amman (media route to Baghdad); and
good co‑operation with the Agencies.”

377.  Mr Campbell also sent Mr Blair an “agreed Iraq strategy document”, advising
him that it showed “a lot of work has been done, and we have the outlines of a good
communications strategy”.

The absence of a “smoking gun”
378.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell on 30 December that the US and UK should
develop a clear “plan B” postponing military action on the basis that inspections
plus the threat of force was containing Saddam Hussein.
379.  On 24 December, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the UK was:
“… clear that a second resolution should be sought if justified. Such an approach
was essential from the point of view of UK politics. Although we had not sought or
received definitive legal advice, I thought it would be hard going with our Attorney
General if there were no second resolution. It would be especially difficult for us
without a second resolution except in a ‘Kosovo‑equivalent situation’ (where we had
a majority in the Security Council but were vetoed by one P5 Member only).”132
132 

Letter Straw to Manning, 24 December 2002, ‘Conversation with Powell: Iraq’.

69

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

380.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed again the importance of Mr Blair making
that point when he next spoke to President Bush. They also discussed that it would be
hard to see how there could be a second resolution, and even harder to justify military
action, if the inspectors failed to find anything.
381.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke twice on 30 December. In their first
conversation, they discussed the possibility that the military would be ready to take
action but there would be no casus belli.133
382.  In their second conversation Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the
likelihood that, when the UN inspectors reported to the Security Council on 27 January,
they would report that they needed more time to complete their work.134
383.  Mr Straw said it was:
“… perfectly possible that a clear casus belli could have been presented by
27 January, in which case we would get a second resolution and military action
would go ahead. But there was a sufficient possibility that we would not be in that
position. We should therefore develop a clear ‘plan B’ for the President and the
Prime Minister in which military action was postponed on the basis that inspections
plus the threat of force was containing Saddam.”
384.  Mr Straw said he would discuss that further with Sir David Manning and
Mr Ricketts.

Resolution 1452
On 30 December, the Security Council adopted resolution 1452, adjusting the Goods
Review List approved in resolution 1409 (2002) and deciding to conduct a thorough review
of the List and the procedures for its implementation.135
Russia and Syria abstained in the vote:

•	
•	

The Russian representative stated that the text was too restrictive.
The Syrian representative stated that Iraq’s co‑operation with the weapons
inspectors and constructive approach on resolution 1441 (2002) should lead to the
lifting of sanctions, not the addition of further restrictions.136

Advice for Mr Blair in early January 2003
385.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair on 3 January 2003 that there was an urgent need
to lower expectations that military action against Iraq was inevitable.
386.  The UK should emphasise that the preferred strategy was peaceful
disarmament and that decisions would not be taken at the Security Council
on 27 January.
387.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell’s view was that it would be rash to bank on
an assumption that the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council on 27 January
would provide grounds to trigger a further meeting of the Security Council and
a resolution authorising the use of force.
388.  There was a need for private discussions with the US on the strategy in the
event that the inspections failed to produce an “early and large smoking gun”.
389.  Mr Straw’s view was that a peaceful solution was, on balance, more likely
than conflict.
390.  Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 3 January 2003 about the need urgently to lower
public expectations, in the UK and abroad, that:
“… the die will be cast at the Security Council meeting on 27 January. If we are not
careful, the necessary military build up will allow the media to set us up for a fall …
when and if the out come … is far from an authorisation for war. Your speech to the
Diplomatic Service Conference on Tuesday [7 January] is therefore very important
in setting the scene for the next three weeks.”137
391.  Mr Straw wrote:
“… a lot of effort is being made by the … agencies to provide Blix and ElBaradei
[with leads drawing on intelligence reports] … to enable them to upgrade their
inspections over the next three weeks. It is possible that this will produce a big
smoking gun, sufficient for Blix and ElBaradei to point in their 27 January report to
a breach of obligation by Iraq sufficient to trigger OPs 11 and 12 of [resolution] 1441,
a further meeting of the Security Council, and a resolution authorising the use of
force … But, in my view (shared by Powell) it would be rash to bank on this. So far,
reality has not matched the expectation generated by the intelligence …
“Scenarios just as likely as a clear material breach by 27 January are:
(i)	 an indication from Blix/El‑Baradei that they have been broadly satisfied
with the level of co‑operation by Iraq, and have so far found nothing of
any significance but will continue looking;

137 

Minute Straw to Prime Minister, 3 January 2003, ‘Iraq – Plan B’.

71

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

(ii)	 concerns by them of some lack of co‑operation, and in respect of some
of their finds, but in neither case adding up to a casus belli to satisfy a
majority on the Security Council.”
392.  Mr Straw suggested the UK’s messages should be:
“•	 to emphasise that our preferred strategy continues to be … disarmament
by peaceful means, through the UN system;

•	
•	

the 27 January meeting is not and never has been a decision deadline …
whatever the inspectors say to the 27 January meeting, decisions, particularly
on military action, would not be taken then.”

393.  Mr Straw warned Mr Blair that the UK would be “faced with the argument that the
finds prove that inspection is working: we will be told to let them continue and destroy
what they find rather than going to war”.
394.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK needed “to discuss very privately with the
Americans over the next few weeks our strategy if inspections produce no early and
large smoking gun”. The purpose would be to explore whether the US could or would
maintain the position of continuing inspections and a military build‑up at a high state
of readiness “for weeks or even months”.
395.  Mr Straw stated that there were signs that President Bush recognised that going
to war “without a publicly convincing trigger, and without a second UNSCR, could well
be politically worse for him … as well as acutely difficult for us”. Secretary Powell had
told Mr Straw that “if there was an insufficient case for a second resolution, there would
equally be an insufficient case for the US to go unilateral”.
396.  Mr Straw offered to discuss the issues with Mr Blair.
397.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Straw had:
“… called me a couple of times over the holiday and emphasised the importance
of TB [Mr Blair] not positioning himself so that no war looked like failure.”138
398.  Mr Straw told the Inquiry that in “very early January [2003] he had bumped in to
two journalists” who had asked about the odds of avoiding war, and that he had replied
“60/40”.139 That reply then “found its way into the newspapers”. Mr Straw stated that
he had formed that “provisional judgement” from his own reading of the Iraqi regime’s
behaviour:
“… by its own terms it acted with some rationality. I could not believe that, faced with
the near certainty of military action if it failed to comply with 1441, the regime could

fail to appreciate that its very survival depended on full compliance, and that this
would be relatively straightforward for them to prove – unless they had something
terrifying to hide. In the event, however, my optimism proved unfounded.”
399.  Asked to explain the basis for his optimism, Mr Straw responded in his statement
for the Inquiry in January 2011 that:
“… a key foundation … was that the United States had committed itself to dealing
with Saddam by working through the United Nations …
“This was coupled to emerging evidence that, while by no means sufficiently, the
inspectors were beginning to make some progress …
“Additionally, there were indications from the United States that it was moving closer
to committing itself to going for a second resolution. My optimism at the time was
therefore also in part based on the hope of a unified Security Council position, in
the form of a second resolution. I believed at the time, and I still believe today, that
confronting Saddam Hussein with this clear united position from the international
community … would have presented us with the best way to deal with Iraq
peacefully.”140
400.  Mr Straw confirmed that he was aware that Mr Blair was more sceptical than he
was, but in early 2003 his instinct was more optimistic that there would be compliance.141
401.  Mr Straw wrote in his memoir that he “wanted to pull back on the idea of a ‘rush
to war’ and in particular avoid Hans Blix’s next report, due on 27 January, being the
decisive moment”. At the beginning of 2003, he was “optimistic about a peaceful
resolution” and, when he had been asked about “the odds of avoiding war” by journalists
from The Times and the Sun on 3 January, he had replied “Sixty/forty”.142
402.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that the US was close to giving up hope
on the UN route and that President Bush was in danger of being driven by the
tempo of his own military build‑up.
403.  The UK should continue to seek to persuade the US that more time was
needed to build the case against Saddam Hussein and improve the odds for
a second resolution.
404.  Sir David Manning provided a note for Mr Blair’s return to office on 4 January,
which stated that there had been “no major developments while you have been away.
But we need to focus hard on inspections, and military planning in the next few days.”143

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

405.  On inspections, Sir David advised:
“My sense is that the Americans are close to giving up hope that UNMOVIC can
deliver results. We should urge them to stick with it. UNMOVIC only reached full
strength at Christmas … The inspectors needed targeted support; and time to build
up operating skills. Even so, it’s true that the chances of them finding a smoking gun
are relatively small which is why we need a defector if we can get one. But this too,
needs time.
“The Americans are in a hurry; perhaps too much of one. This colours their
approach to UNMOVIC and makes them impatient … Too much looks like hurried
improvisation, half thought out strategy, with fingers crossed that Saddam will
collapse in short order …”
406.  Sir David concluded that there was a danger of the US being driven by the tempo
of the military build‑up and understandable preference to fight in the spring not the
summer. In his view, “more time” was needed “to build the case against Saddam and
improve the odds for a second resolution”.
407.  In a manuscript note on Mr Straw’s letter of 3 January, Sir David Manning told
Mr Blair that Washington was “aware of the pitfalls and thinking in terms of a second
resolution”.144
408.  Sir David Manning discussed potential developments before Dr Blix’s report to the
Security Council on 27 January with Dr Rice on 3 January. “Emphasising that he was
speaking personally”, he told Dr Rice that he was:
“… convinced that we needed a second resolution; and that we would only get one
if we could produce convincing evidence that Saddam was in breach. Supposition
would not be enough. Apart from the problem of the Security Council, we would not
be able to get endorsement from the House of Commons for military action …”145
409.  Sir David suggested the pursuit of a three‑part policy:

•	

•	

compiling a register of intelligence reports that pointed to specific locations
where Saddam Hussein might be hiding WMD, or documents relevant to
the WMD programme, and trying “to persuade Dr Blix to mount co‑ordinated
surprise inspections [...] It was much too early to assume that the inspection
route would yield nothing”;
urging Dr Blix to state publicly that there were numerous gaps and unanswered
questions in the declaration: “By demanding that Saddam produce the missing
pieces we would be putting the pressure back on him in a way which his
apologists would find difficult to counter”; and

•	

staying closely engaged with the Arab world and exploring the recent suggestion
that Saddam Hussein should be given an ultimatum to leave Iraq.

410.  Returning to the issue of a second resolution, Sir David wrote that he had repeated
that it would be needed:
“… if we were to take military action. This was not because our determination to deal
with the Iraqi problem had diminished in any way. Rather it was about the political
realities in the UK.”
411.  Sir David Manning recorded that the UK must now work closely with the Americans
over inspections and approaches to Dr Blix. He knew that the FCO and SIS were
working on that and he had asked for advice by 8 January, “on the best way forward”,
which he could show to Mr Blair.
412.  Sir David and Dr Rice had also discussed the possibility of a meeting between
President Bush and Mr Blair.
413.  Sir David recommended that Mr Blair should read the record of the conversation in
full and that it had been “helpful on a second resolution”.146 Dr Rice had been very keen
that President Bush and Mr Blair should meet at the end of January.
414.  Describing this conversation, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that Dr Rice
had told Sir David Manning that:
“… she had been giving considerable thought to this whole issue over the Christmas
holidays and had decided that a second resolution was necessary for American
interests, that the American public were not necessarily fully on board for an attack
on Iraq and the use of the American military and this was something that she felt the
President would need to consider very carefully.”147
415.  After the conversation with President Bush on 16 December and the meeting
of the Security Council on 19 December, Mr Blair also reviewed the position on
Iraq in the light of likely US actions.
416.  By the time Mr Blair returned to the office on 4 January 2003 he had
concluded that the “likelihood was war” and, if conflict could not be avoided,
the right thing to do was fully to support the US.
417.  Mr Blair focused on the need to establish evidence of an Iraqi breach,
persuade opinion of the case for action, and finalise the strategy with President
Bush at the end of January.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

418.  In a meeting overseas in early January, SIS1 told Mr Blair that the body of
available evidence was “highly damning” but “none of the reports could yet be termed
a silver bullet”.148 Mr Blair had been “surprised and pleased” that so much had been
accumulated, but he needed some more evidence that Saddam Hussein was in breach
(of resolution 1441), which he (Mr Blair) could use as the basis for personal assurances
to Cabinet, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), and to key allies such as President
Chirac and President Bush and regional leaders. As a result, SIS1 recorded that
Mr Blair had asked for a “stocktake”, including an assessment of the likelihood that the
UNMOVIC process would produce that kind of evidence.
419.  On 4 January, Mr Blair sent a long note to officials in No.10.149
420.  On Iraq, Mr Blair stated:
“We start from behind. People suspect US motives; don’t accept Saddam is a threat;
worry it will make us a target. Yet the truth is removing Saddam is right; he is a
threat; and WMD has to be countered. So there is a big job of persuasion. We need
the following in place:
(i)	 most obviously, the evidence of breach of the UN resolution leading
hopefully to a new resolution. Time is short. We need either evidence of
actual WMD; or documentation concealed; or an eye witness account
of the programme. We are making efforts on all three. But one or more
needs to be in place. [...] our biggest hindrance, is the intimidation
Saddam is exercising. Those who might co‑operate are being told
very clearly their families will die. So even though we all know the
declaration … is a lie, proving the lie will be hard. I need an early meeting
on this with C.
(ii)	 We need to set out the WMD case generally; publish evidence of it; and
have some high profile interdiction of WMD material. People just totally
underestimate the WMD threat.
(iii)	 We need to link WMD and terrorism. The truth is the two coming together,
is only a matter of time. But people need to understand that if we don’t
act, the world will be more unsafe.
(iv)	 We need to prepare a very clear statement of guarantees for the Iraqi
people, setting out territorial integrity etc; and I assume without Saddam
we could lift sanctions.
(v)	 We need to work out the post‑Saddam scenario. Are we going to identify
him, and his close associates only, as fit for removal, in the hope of having
the regime crumble; or are we going to be more forward. By instinct,
I favour making it clear: removing Saddam is the immediate task; the

new government has to be stable; and we can move forward in time …
There must be as little as possible vested interest in resistance.
(vi)	 We need to be sure the military plan is viable. I need a meeting on this
and our military’s assurance that the plan can work. This is no small
undertaking.
(vii)	 We must strive to move the MEPP forward …
(viii)	We have got to show sensitivity to any humanitarian fall‑out from war.
Britain should take the lead on this, working with the UN.”
421.  Mr Blair believed it would be “sensible to go to Washington late January in order to
finalise the strategy”.
422.  There is no evidence that Mr Blair had seen Mr Straw’s minute of 3 January or
Sir David Manning’s minute of the same day before he wrote his note of 4 January.
423.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that, in December 2002 and during a short winter
break in January 2003, he had “tried to work out what was the right thing to do”. He was:
“… past expediency, past political calculation, past personal introspection. I knew
this could be the end politically. I just wanted to know: what is the right thing?
“I could see by now … that barring something unanticipated, the likelihood was war.
We could opt out … I was sure … and stay out of the conflict, coming in only for
the aftermath. We had many allies by then. Thirteen out of 25 EU countries were
onside … But many were taking the route of avoiding the initial fighting.”150
424.  At Chequers over Christmas 2002, he had asked himself:
“What did I truly believe? That Saddam was about to attack Britain or the US?
No. That he was a bigger WMD threat than Iran or North Korea or Libya? Not really,
though he was the only leader to have used them. That left alone now, with these
inspections ending the same way as the last, he would threaten the stability of
the region? Very possibly. That he would leach WMD material or provide help to
terrorists? Yes … Was it better for his people to be rid of him? For sure. Could it be
done without a long and bloody war? You can never be sure of that. Did I want more
time? Yes, but to allow me to probe every other way of doing it, rather than because
I believed the nature of his regime would ever change. Would a new Iraq help build
a new Middle East? I thought that was possible.
“Did I think that if we drew back now, we would have to deal with him later? … yes,
there was no other way that this man with his past was going to be anything other
than a source of instability. At some point, especially if strengthened now, he would
be back to his old tricks.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“So, in or out? In I concluded. And, if in, better in fully and not partly. I still thought it
possible to avoid war. I still thought it possible that other alternatives, diplomatic or
through a coup, of some sort (there was much private Arab talk about such a thing),
could be available to avoid conflict. I was determined at the least, to try to persuade
the Americans to get more time. But I had said I would be with them, and if conflict
could not be avoided, I would be in with the whole and not half a heart.”

Public statements, 7 and 8 January 2003
PUBLICATION OF THE UK’S POLICY OBJECTIVES
425.  The UK’s policy objectives in relation to Iraq were published by Mr Straw
on 7 January.
426.  Mr Blair’s Note of 4 January was discussed at Mr Blair’s Monday morning meeting
with No.10 staff on 6 January.151
427.  Subsequent discussions and decisions on the military plan, and planning for
humanitarian assistance and a post‑conflict Iraq, are addressed in Section 6.
428.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“TB was pretty sure there would be a war, or that in any event Saddam would go,
and war remained the likeliest if not the only way of that coming about.”
429.  Mr Campbell added:
“On Iraq, pretty much everyone was emphasising how little support there was, how
little understanding there was of a real threat, but he [Mr Blair] was in pretty defiant
mood on that too, said the threat was real and people would come round.”
430.  Mr Campbell wrote that he had talked to Mr Blair and then agreed in a conference
call that the policy objectives should be published. In Mr Campbell’s view: “These
strategy papers were as much about internal understanding as publicity.”
431.  Mr Bowen informed the FCO on 6 January that Mr Blair had decided to publish
the policy objectives for Iraq.152
432.  The objectives were published in a Written Ministerial Statement by Mr Straw
on 7 January.153
433.  Mr Straw stated that he had “made clear to the House on a number of occasions”
that the policy on Iraq was “to ensure that Iraq” complied “with its obligations under

relevant … Security Council resolutions … including by giving up its weapons of mass
destruction”. He “thought, however, that the House would now appreciate a more
detailed statement of the Government’s objectives”.
434.  The “prime objective” was:
“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated
programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles … as
set out in UNSCRs. This would reduce Iraq’s ability to threaten its neighbours
and the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its own people. UNSCRs
also require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured Kuwaitis and property
taken from Kuwait.”
435.  Iraq’s failure to comply with the “will of the international community” as expressed
by the UN was “thereby perpetuating the threat to international peace and security”.
436.  Mr Straw also stated that a “further objective” was “to maintain the authority
of the United Nations by demonstrating the Security Council’s effective response
to the challenge posed by Iraq’s non‑compliance”; and that “Success in achieving our
prime objective should help deter the proliferation of WMD and BM [ballistic missiles]
more generally.”
437.  Mr Straw identified that the six “immediate priorities” were to:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

support UNMOVIC/IAEA inspectors in Iraq;
enable UNMOVIC/IAEA to ensure long‑term Iraqi compliance;
maintain international solidarity behind the UN Security Council.
preserve regional stability;
continue to make military plans in case military action was needed; and
continue to support humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering in Iraq.

438.  The objectives were based closely on those approved by Mr Blair in October 2002,
as was the definition of the post‑conflict end state:
“We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law abiding state, within
its present borders, co‑operating with the international community, no longer
posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its
international obligations and providing effective and representative government to its
own people.”
439.  A reference to achieving the end state “as rapidly as possible” was omitted. Other
changes included the addition of a statement that the objectives were “consistent with
wider government policy”, including:

•	
•	

“Efforts to resolve other causes of regional stability, including the MEPP”;
“Wider political engagement with Arab countries and the Islamic world”;

79

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

“Efforts to counter the proliferation of WMD”; and
“The elimination of terrorism as a force in international affairs”.

440.  Mr Straw also stated:
“To achieve our objectives we will act in conformity with international law, including
the United Nations Charter and international humanitarian law.”
441.  Mr Straw concluded that the Government was “working intensively with our
allies and partners to secure the peaceful disarmament of Iraq’s WMD by means of
UNMOVIC/IAEA inspections”. He also warned that if the Iraqi regime did not comply,
it would, as resolution 1441 made clear, “face serious consequences”.
MR HOON’S STATEMENT, 7 JANUARY 2003
442.  On 7 January, Mr Hoon announced a decision to deploy additional maritime
forces, including an amphibious capability, and an order to enable the call‑out of
Reservists.
443.  This was presented as a necessary part of a policy of maintaining the
pressure on Saddam Hussein to persuade him to disarm. Mr Hoon stated that
no decision had been taken to commit UK forces to military action; and no
“justification” for military action had been identified.
444.  In an oral statement on Iraq on 7 January, Mr Hoon commended the policy
objectives to the House of Commons.154
445.  Mr Hoon also stated that the Government was “restating” its “full and active
support” for the UN inspections and was “looking to them to investigate urgently the
gaps in Iraq’s declaration” of its WMD programmes, which failed “to give a satisfactory
account of Iraq’s activities”.
446.  Mr Hoon added that, while the Government wanted Iraq “to disarm voluntarily”,
it was “evident” that this would not be achieved unless Saddam Hussein was presented
with “a clear and credible threat of force”.
447.  Mr Hoon concluded:
“None of that means that the use of force is inevitable … no decision has been taken
to commit those forces to action … But … as long as Saddam’s compliance with …
resolution 1441 is in doubt … the threat of force must remain and it must be a
real one.”
448.  The details of military deployments in the announcement are addressed in
Section 6.1.

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

449.  Mr Hoon did not respond to an observation from Mr Bernard Jenkin (Conservative)
that “It now seems unlikely that the UN inspectors will find any weapons of mass
destruction in Iraq. Saddam Hussein has had too much time to conceal them and
to destroy the evidence.”
450.  Asked by Mr James Paice (Conservative) about the “huge task to convince the
British people that they are doing the right thing”, Mr Hoon replied that it was:
“… not possible to secure overwhelming public support for military action before
the explanation for that military action has been given and, therefore, before the
justification for that military action has been identified. We have not yet reached that
point in the process, and unless and until we do I accept that we cannot explain the
justification for military action.”
451.  Other points made by Mr Hoon in response to questions included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The Iraqi declaration was “seriously short on detail and lacks in particular any
significant reference” to the conclusions reached by UNSCOM in 1999.
If Saddam Hussein left Iraq, there “would be a different regime as far as the
international community was concerned”. The removal of weapons of mass
destruction from the control of the regime would be a “prerequisite”.
Military action would be necessary “because every other avenue has been
exhausted” and the opportunities offered by resolution 1441 had been “spurned
by the Government in Iraq”.
There was no “inevitability about conflict”.
The position of the US was “no different” to that of the UK, “it agreed to a United
Nations process and it wants that process to be properly implemented and
enforced”.

MR BLAIR’S SPEECH TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE CONFERENCE, 7 JANUARY 2003
452.  As recommended by Mr Straw and Mr Campbell, Mr Blair used his speech
to senior diplomats and others on 7 January to set out the importance for the
UK of remaining “the closest” ally of the US.
453.  Within that context, Mr Blair stated that if Iraq defied the UN, the US should
not be “forced to take on this issue alone”.
454.  In his speech to the Foreign Office Conference on 7 January about Britain’s
place in the world, Mr Blair stated that “people all over the world” wanted the “universal
values” of freedom, human rights, the rule of law and democracy, alongside “justice, the
opportunity for all”.155 The world had an “overriding common interest to make progress
with order”; and that the threat was “change through disorder, because then the
consequences of change cannot be managed”.
155 

The National Archives, 7 January 2003, PM Speech to Foreign Office Conference in London.

81

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

455.  Mr Blair set out seven principles to guide the UK. The first was that the UK:
“… should remain the closest ally of the US, and as allies to influence them to
continue broadening their agenda. We are an ally of the US not because they are
powerful, but because we share their values … Anti‑Americanism … is a foolish
indulgence. For all their faults and all nations have them, the US are a force for
good …
“… it is massively in our self‑interest to remain close allies …
“But we should use this alliance to good effect … People listen to the US … they
want the US to listen back.
“So for the international community, the MEPP is … important … the UN
is important.
“The US choice to go through the UN over Iraq was a vital step, in itself and
as a symbol of the desire to work with others …
“The price of British influence is not … to do what the US asks. I would never commit
British troops to a war I thought was wrong or unnecessary. Where we disagree …
we disagree.
“But the price of influence is that we do not leave the US to face tricky issues
alone. By tricky, I mean the ones which people wish weren’t there, don’t want to
deal with, and … know the US should confront … So if the US act alone, they are
unilateralist … International terrorism is one such issue … WMD is another …
[A]t my first meeting with President Bush I said this was the key issue facing the
international community. I believe this even more today … But no one can doubt the
salience of WMD … and the importance of countering it …
“So when as with Iraq, the international community through the UN makes a demand
on a regime to disarm itself of WMD and that regime refuses, that regime threatens
us. It may be uncomfortable … unless the world takes a stand on this issue of WMD
and sends out a clear signal, we will rue the consequences of our weakness.
“America should not be forced to take on this issue alone. We should be part of it.
Of course it should go through the UN – that was our wish and what the US did.
But if the will of the UN is breached then the will should be enforced.
“Jack Straw has today set out for Parliament … our policy objectives on Iraq.
“So when the US confront these issues, we should be with them, and we should,
in return, expect these issues to be confronted with the international community,
proportionately, sensibly and in a way that delivers a better prospect of long‑term
peace, security and justice.”

82

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

456.  Mr Blair’s seventh principle identified the need to “reach out to the Muslim
world”. Mr Blair stated: “The reason there is opposition over our stance on Iraq has
less to do with any love of Saddam, but over a sense of double standards. The MEPP
remains essential …”
PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 8 JANUARY 2003
457.  In PMQs on 8 January Mr Blair reiterated his position that if Saddam Hussein
did not disarm voluntarily he would be disarmed by force, but he declined to
speculate about the circumstances when that would be necessary.
458.  Iraq and reports of differences between Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were raised by
several Members of Parliament during Prime Minister’s Questions on 8 January.156
459.  Mr Blair consistently reiterated his position that Iraq must comply with the Security
Council resolutions and “must be disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction”. If Iraq
did not do so willingly, it would “have to be done by force”.
460.  Mr Blair declined to respond to questions from Mr Iain Duncan Smith about
whether he agreed with Mr Straw’s view that the prospects of military action were
“60:40 against”.
461.  Mr Duncan Smith also commented that “one cannot half prepare for war. Not for
the first time, the Government are sending different messages to different audiences …”
462.  Referring to Mr Hoon’s statement the previous day, Mr Blair replied:
“We have made every preparation that we should make … It is completely wrong
to say that British troops are half prepared for any action. That is nonsense.”
463.  In response to questions from Mr Charles Kennedy about whether Britain would
be involved if the inspectors failed to produce concrete evidence of weapons of mass
destruction but the US “nonetheless” decided to go ahead with military action, Mr Blair
replied that he was “not going to speculate on the circumstances that might arise”.
The weapons inspectors were “in Iraq to discover whether there has been a breach
of the UN resolution” and they should be “allowed to do their work”.
464.  Mr Blair also told:

•	

156 

Mrs Anne Campbell (Labour) that she was “right to say that people have
anxieties about the possibility of conflict in Iraq” and that British troops “should
never” be put into action “unless it is necessary to do so”, but he “believed

of international terrorism” were the “key security threats” facing the UK and that
it was “only a matter of time before those issues come together”; and

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

Mrs Patsy Calton (Liberal Democrat) that it was his “duty to explain” why he
thought it was “necessary in certain circumstances to commit British troops
to war”. If Saddam Hussein was “in breach of the United Nations’ will and
we refused to act as an international community” it would “send a signal to
Saddam that we would do nothing to prevent him from building up weapons
of mass destruction” and “a signal that we were not serious about the issue of
weapons of mass destruction”. He understood why people felt that it was “a very
distant threat”, but what was dangerous was to do nothing: we would “rue the
consequences of that weakness later”.

465.  Mr Blair had an internal meeting on Iraq with No.10 officials after PMQs on
8 January.157 Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had said that, if Dr Blix found nothing and
the UN gave no specific sanction, it was going to be very hard to do. Mr Blair felt that we
had to be out there fairly soon making the case, that it was only a matter of time before
Al Qaida get their hands on WMD unless we show how serious we are at dealing with
the WMD issue. He was clear that it was the right thing to do, but also accepted that
there was not much support.

Cabinet, 9 January 2003
466.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 9 January that there would be an opportunity for an
“in‑depth” discussion on Iraq the following week.
467.  Mr Straw was overseas on 9 January.158
468.  Mr Blair told the Cabinet on 9 January that the inspection process was fully under
way and:
“The report to the UN Security Council on 27 January was in no sense a deadline,
rather a first report of [the inspectors’] findings. Meanwhile, the build up of military
forces was necessary to sustain the pressure on Iraq.”159
469.  Points made during the discussion included:

•	
•	

the inspections process had its own integrity and should not be compromised;

•	

the onset of summer in Iraq did not constitute an absolute deadline by which
military action would have to be taken; and

inspections were being conducted against the background of a concerted
Iraqi plan to disperse and conceal WMD, including threats to execute Iraqi
experts involved with such programmes if they divulged information to the UN
inspectors;

the MEPP had to be taken forward and efforts were continuing to hold a
conference with the Palestinians on reform in London the following week.

470.  Mr Hoon reported his visit to Turkey and the sensitivities about actions
involving Iraq.
471.  Commenting on the preparations for the deployment of military forces to the
Gulf, Mr Hoon told his colleagues that no decisions had been taken to launch military
action. Nor had the US finalised its military planning. Some changes to forces assigned
to Operation FRESCO, to provide an emergency fire fighting capability during the
firefighters’ strike, would be necessary to keep options open.
472.  Mr Blair concluded that the future behaviour of Saddam Hussein in responding
to UN pressure was “unpredictable”. The UK was “right to continue with its military
preparations”. It should also maintain the focus on the fight with international terrorism
and preventive measures at home. Media reports of a rift within the Cabinet were
“nonsense”. Cabinet the following week would “provide the opportunity for an in‑depth
discussion of Iraq”.
473.  In the press briefing after Cabinet, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman
said that Mr Blair had “underlined his view that the weapons inspectors in Iraq had
to be given the time and space to do their job properly”, and that “while 27 January
was an important staging point in the process, it should not be regarded in any way
as a deadline”.160
474.  The Spokesman also said dismissed press reports that Mr Blair had authorised
an attack on one Secretary of State by another.
475.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that there had been a discussion about
comments by Cabinet Ministers and the need to avoid giving personal opinions.161
Ms Short had accused Mr Hoon and the MOD of briefing against Mr Straw. She had also
asked for a discussion of the military options because she did not believe that UK forces
were needed.
476.  In his memoir, Mr Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons, June 2001 to
March 2003, wrote that three newspapers that morning had carried a story demanding
Mr Straw’s resignation, and a claim that Mr Blair had authorised attacks by Mr Hoon.162
Mr Cook did not believe the story. He wrote that in Cabinet Ms Short had deplored the
attacks and he had said that Mr Straw was “doing a great job in keeping the Iraq crisis
in the UN track”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

477.  Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that “the presentation to … Cabinet was still – nothing
was inevitable. We are pressing the UN option. No decisions on military action, whereas
you can see that, at another level, the decisions on military action were hardening up
quite considerably.”163

Security Council, 9 January 2003
478.  In response to the briefing to the Security Council by Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei on 9 January, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that members
of the Security Council wanted time for the inspectors to reach a view.
479.  As agreed on 19 December, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei gave an informal update of
their assessment of the Iraqi declaration and the progress of inspection activities to the
members of the Security Council on 9 January.164 Dr Blix understood that the meeting
was intended to allow members of the Council to comment on Iraq’s declaration.
480.  Dr Blix stated that, if UNMOVIC had found a “smoking gun” or if there had been
any impediment to their inspections, it would have been reported to the Council. Iraqi
officials had “sought to construe the prompt access given to inspection teams and the
fact that no weapons of mass destruction or other proscribed items have been found
as confirmation” that there were none in Iraq; but the matter was “not … that simple”.
Prompt access was “an indispensible element of transparency” as part of a process
of peaceful disarmament, but it was:
“… by no means sufficient to give confidence that nothing is hidden in a large
country with an earlier record of avoiding disclosures. Iraq is very familiar with the
fact that only declarations supported by evidence, will give confidence about the
elimination of weapons. In this respect we have not so far made progress.”
481.  Commenting on the “issues on which doubts exist as to whether all proscribed
items or activities had been eliminated”, identified by UNSCOM and the Amorim report
in 1999 (see Section 1.1), Dr Blix added that UNMOVIC was “not bound by every
conclusion in these reports”. But they did give Iraq a “clear idea of questions, which
need to be answered and of doubts, which must be dispelled by very active efforts”.
His “overall impression” remained that Iraq’s declaration was “rich in volume but poor
in new information” and “practically devoid of new evidence on such issues”.
482.  Dr Blix said that “to create confidence that it has no more weapons of mass
destruction or proscribed activities relating to such weapons, Iraq must present
credible evidence”. That could be “of the most varied kind”, including “interviews by
knowledgeable persons who are not subjected to intimidation”. He had “not asserted …
that proscribed items or activities” existed; but if they did “Iraq should present them

in our presence”. There was “still time” for that. There was “no way the inspectors” could
“close a file by simply invoking the precept that Iraq cannot prove the negative”. In “such
cases”, the inspectors “must conclude, as they have done in the past, that the absence
of the particular item is not assured”.
483.  Dr Blix listed a series of inconsistencies between the declaration and earlier Iraqi
declarations which had been described as full, final and complete, in addition to the
issues he had highlighted on 19 December, including in relation to special munitions,
imports of missile engines and solid missile fuel and VX. He also stated that UNMOVIC
did not feel that Iraq had “made a serious effort” to provide lists of personnel engaged
in proscribed programmes.
484.  Dr ElBaradei reported that good progress had been made in re‑establishing
knowledge of Iraq’s capabilities and that “no evidence of ongoing prohibited
nuclear‑related activities” had been detected and the IAEA’s verification activities
were “an important deterrent to the resumption of such activities”.165
485.  Further work would be necessary before the IAEA could draw definitive
conclusions, including in relation to reports of Iraqi attempts to import uranium after
1991, the relocation and consumption of dual‑use materials, and the attempted purchase
of prohibited aluminium tubes, which appeared to be “consistent with the reverse
engineering of rockets” and “not directly suitable” for the manufacture of centrifuges.
Dr ElBaradei emphasised the importance of active co‑operation from Iraq.
486.  A press statement issued by the President of the Security Council stated that
the members had “listened with the utmost attention and interest”; and that they had
“reiterated their full support for the work and action of Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei and
to the continuation of inspection activities”.166
487.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the discussion had been “relatively low
key”. Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had made “clear that the Iraqi declaration is inadequate
and that Iraq needs to co‑operate more pro‑actively”.167 There had been more than
250 inspections at more than 200 sites. Sir Jeremy had noted that Iraqi co‑operation
in giving access was “satisfactory”, but “more passive than active”. Iraq had to be
pro‑active to prove it had no WMD. He had “hoped the pace could accelerate”.
488.  Sir Jeremy also reported that Ambassador John Negroponte, US Permanent
Representative to the UN, had again described the Iraqi declaration as a material breach
and stated that a continued failure to co‑operate actively would constitute a further one.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

489.  In a subsequent conversation with representatives of EU Missions in New York,
Sir Jeremy had stated that it was “clear that Council members wanted a steady,
intensifying process which would give the inspectors time to provide either positive
or negative proofs”; and that “if the inspections proceeded normally, with increasing
intensity, there would be no need to rush to an early military judgement (although the
US response … was unpredictable)”. The timetable set out in resolution 1284 (1999)
was “still obligatory”; and that the UK believed Iraq was concealing evidence.168

Growing pressure to find evidence of Saddam Hussein’s
non‑compliance
490.  With indications of concerns in Washington about becoming trapped in the
UN and tensions between the UN timetable and the military build‑up, the UK focus
on the need to find convincing evidence that Saddam Hussein was not complying
with the obligations set out in resolution 1441 and preceding resolutions
intensified.
491.  Mr Blair had a meeting with Sir Richard Dearlove on the afternoon of 9 January.169
There is no No.10 record of the meeting.
492.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary recorded Sir Richard’s view that it had
been a good meeting at which Mr Blair had emphasised the importance of being able
to demonstrate that the Iraqis were in material breach of resolution 1441.
493.  In response to a question from Mr Blair about the likelihood of being able to find
a “silver bullet” that would demonstrate a material breach, Sir Richard was reported to
have said that “he felt the odds were 50/50”. That was “higher than the US estimates but
he simply could not guarantee a successful outcome”.
494.  Sir Richard had also reported that Mr Blair’s parting words were: “Richard, my fate
is in your hands.”
495.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that:

•	
•	
•	

C told Mr Blair that Dr Blix “knew he was being ‘cat and moused’ but he was
not on a mission. He was sure that Saddam was lying but he had to establish
that for himself. C felt that we had a better chance of finding the breaches than
the US.”
Mr Blair had said, “half in jest”, “My future is in your hands.”
“The nightmare scenario, or one of them, was a discovery that was sufficient
for the US but not for us.”

•	

“C said the other risk was that we found the evidence of the breach before the
US was ready to go to war … if the inspectors had another month with genuine
access, the picture would be pretty clear. We were now pushing the line that
they needed time and space to do the job.”170

496.  Asked about the comment that Mr Blair’s future was in his hands, Sir Richard
Dearlove told the Inquiry that he thought Mr Blair “was beginning to understand that he
was in a tough position vis‑a‑vis the inspection issue”.171
497.  In response to a further question, Sir Richard stated:
“No, I think when the Prime Minister says something like that – the one thing
if you are head of SIS is you have to be quite robust, and not be sort of put off
by such comments.
“I think the problem for the Prime Minister at that point in time is it’s much more
important to him domestically that UNMOVIC has a success than it is to the
US Administration.”
498.  A report of a discussion between Adm Boyce and General Richard Myers,
Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that the US could stay poised for military
operations for 3‑4 months.172
499.  Sir David Manning wrote to Mr Powell that this was a “much better timeline as far
as inspections are concerned. Whether Bush will buy it is another matter.”173
500.  When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke on 11 January, they discussed
reporting in both the UK and US, including a Washington Post article criticising Secretary
Powell for trapping the US Government in the UN route and Mr Blair’s comments that
27 January was not a deadline which would be widely noted in Washington.174 There
was a need to synchronise the military planning and politics. It was improbable that
the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council on 27 January would provide sufficient
evidence for a second resolution, and the negotiation of such a resolution would take
weeks.
501.  Mr Blair sent a note to No.10 officials on 12 January.175

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

502.  On Iraq, he wrote:
“We need to go back to the basic principle: the UN has made a decision; that
decision must be upheld. The inspectors inspect; if they find a breach, then the UN
should pass a new resolution. If it does, how can anyone dispute the case for war?
If the UN doesn’t, despite a breach, then we are in the same positions as we were
at the time of Kosovo. But the integrity of the UN process has to be upheld.
“We have two immediate weaknesses in our case:

•	
•	

people think we will go to war even if no breach is found. That is not correct.
people don’t really believe WMD or Saddam are real threats.”

503.  Mr Ricketts was in Washington on 13 January.176 He reported to Mr Straw’s
Private Secretary that his overriding impression was that:
“… there is still a good deal of uncertainty and confusion, but that all accept we are
entering a critical four weeks, in which the tensions between the political/UN track
and the military build‑up will come to a head … the President is getting impatient
and wants a basis for moving against Iraq sooner rather than later.
“There are conflicting pressures in all directions … the press are full of the
drum‑beat of military build‑up. With the sense that war is close, people want to rally
round the President. On the other hand there is still a lot of uneasiness … White
House letters are running nine to one against the war.
“… there will be big pressure on President Bush to say something powerful in the
State of the Union message on 28 January. I was assured … this would not be a
declaration of war. But equally no‑one thinks that he will want the present uncertainty
to drag on … there is no work in hand on how to sustain the present strategy over
a period of months.
“Blix will be the fulcrum in the coming weeks … All I talked to were determined not
to allow Saddam to put us back in the position where the onus was on the inspectors
to find something …”
504.  Mr Ricketts reported that the US was considering a presentation setting out
“the evidence of Saddam’s bad faith” soon after 27 January to “challenge the Security
Council to go for a second resolution”. Views amongst US officials on the wisdom of that
were mixed.
505.  Mr Ricketts’ minute was copied to Sir David Manning and others.
506.  In the context of a “flurry of comment … in the UK media” and Mr Blair’s press
conference later that day, Sir David told Dr Rice on 13 January that Mr Blair would point

out that Saddam Hussein was “wasting the UN opportunity with every day that he failed
to comply”.177
507.  Discussing the difficulty of finding a smoking gun, Sir David told Dr Rice:
“… we should not give up on looking for hard evidence. The discovery of the rocket
motors178 might not be a breach of 1441, but it was important evidence that Saddam
was determined to thwart international controls. It told us much about his approach
and vindicated our claims that he was a liar.”
508.  Sir David reported that he had:
“… rehearsed again our need for a second resolution before moving to military
action. There would be support here for action against Iraq if sanctioned by the UN.
But it would be very hard, and probably impossible, for us without another resolution.
The domestic politics were too difficult.”
509.  Sir David asked Dr Rice if the US would be content to let the inspections run until
the end of February; he “understood the military pressures” but it “would be important
to UK and wider European opinion to see the strongest possible case”. The UK “would
want … time to build this”. Sir David added that “the stronger the case, the easier the
President would find it to secure international support and a second resolution”.
510.  Sir David concluded that “at present it seems unlikely that there will be enough
evidence” by 27 January, “to persuade the Security Council to start work on the
second resolution”.
MR BLAIR’S PRESS CONFERENCE, 13 JANUARY 2003
511.  In public, Mr Blair emphasised that the inspectors had only just started work
and there was no point in imposing an “arbitrary timescale”.
512.  Mr Blair’s press conference on 13 January was dominated by questions on Iraq.179
513.  In his opening remarks, Mr Blair stated that, while the threat seemed to some
people to be remote, he passionately believed Iraq must be disarmed of its weapons of
mass destruction; the authority of the United Nations must be upheld; and rogue states
and terrorist organisations shown that “when we say we intend to deal with the issue
of weapons of mass destruction, we mean it”. The UN had “given Saddam [Hussein]
a chance”; he should take the peaceful route and disarm.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

514.  In response to questions, Mr Blair stated:

•	

•	
•	

•	

•	

•	
•	

Inspections were the right process, but the inspectors had only just started their
work and reached their full complement the previous week. There was no point
in putting an “arbitrary timescale” on their task. Saddam Hussein had a duty to
co‑operate. In Mr Blair’s view, Iraq’s declaration of 8 December was false and it
was the inspectors’ job to find out the truth and report their findings.
If there was a breach, there would be a further discussion at the UN and the UK
expected the UN to honour its undertakings and for its authority to be upheld.
The trade in chemical, biological and nuclear weapons posed a direct threat to
Britain’s security. Without a stand, it was simply a matter of time before terrorism
and weapons of mass destruction came together. Iraq was important because it
was known that Saddam Hussein had the weapons and had used them before.
It had been “chosen” by the UN and the UN “had to be a way of resolving
this and sending a signal to the whole of the world that this trade will not be
tolerated, that people who have these weapons in breach of UN resolutions, will
be forced to disarm”.
The “discussion” on Iraq had “begun against the background of sanctions
eroding, of us being unable to be sure that we were really preventing Saddam
acquiring these weapons and of intelligence to the British Security Services …
I don’t think they would be advising me this if they weren’t doing this honestly
and properly. There is no doubt at all in our mind that Saddam has been trying to
rebuild that arsenal of chemical, biological and potentially nuclear capability …”
Indicting Saddam Hussein was “kept under consideration” and “reasonable
arguments” had been made by Ms Ann Clwyd, Vice‑Chair of the Parliamentary
Labour Party and Chair of INDICT (see Box later in this Section), and others. It
would be a decision for the Attorney General “but we have to weigh up a number
of different considerations as to whether it is worth such a prosecution. But I
don’t think that should divert us from the main issue … which is … whether it is
necessary to change the regime in Iraq in order to disarm them of weapons of
mass destruction.”
There was “no point in speculating” about what might happen if the US wanted
to take action before a smoking gun had been found; whatever happened,
Saddam would be disarmed.
The way to avoid military action would be for Saddam “to agree to make an
honest declaration of what he has and have it destroyed”.

LORD GOLDSMITH’S DRAFT ADVICE, 14 JANUARY 2003
515.  As agreed with Mr Powell on 19 December 2002, Lord Goldsmith handed his
draft advice on resolution 1441 to Mr Blair on 14 January.
516.  The draft advice stated that a further decision by the Security Council would
be required to revive the authorisation to use force contained in resolution 678
(1990) although that decision did not need be in the form of a further resolution.
517.  Lord Goldsmith also wrote that there would be no authorisation for military
action in the event of a veto by one of the P5.
518.  Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice180 and No.10’s response, including Mr Blair’s
statements that military action would not be ruled out if a further resolution in response
to an Iraqi breach was vetoed, are addressed in Section 5.

Mr Annan’s comments, 14 January 2003
At a press conference on 14 January, Mr Annan stated:
“We are all aware … of Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the legislative climate
surrounding the passage of that resolution. We will have to assume … that the
members of the Council acted in good faith; that the issue is disarmament and
that they will do whatever it takes to disarm; and that if the disarmament were to
succeed and we were to agree that Iraq has been stripped of its weapons of mass
destruction, then that should be the end of the story. If, on the other hand, it were to
come out that Iraq continues to defy, and that disarmament has not happened … the
Council will have to face up to its responsibilities and take the necessary action. But,
of course, this is the understanding and the spirit of the resolution, which I hope we
will all respect.”181

PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 15 JANUARY 2003
519.  During PMQs on 15 January Mr Blair answered a number of questions on Iraq.182
520.  Mr Alan Beith (Liberal Democrat) asked what would happen if the inspectors
reported on 27 January that they needed more time to complete their work, and
whether a statement made by Mr Blair’s official spokesman that the inspectors would
be given the time and space they needed reflected President Bush’s view. Mr Blair
initially referred to remarks made in his press conference on 13 January, including
that he was not going to speculate on “arbitrary timetables”, and to remarks made by
Mr Annan on 14 January that, if Iraq continued to defy the UN and disarmament hadn’t
happened, the Security Council would have to “face up to its responsibilities and take
the necessary action”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

521.  Pressed by Mr Beith to answer the question in the light of the very serious
consequences of military action before the case for it had been made, Mr Blair replied
that before the adoption of resolution 1441, many people had insisted that the US would
“not bother with” the UN and “would not give the process a chance to work”. “That had
not been the case”. Mr Blair added that “the single most dangerous thing we could do
at the moment”, which would in his view “increase the likelihood of conflict, would be to
send out a signal of any weakness in our determination to see the mandate laid out by
the UN carried through”.
522.  Asked by Mr Iain Duncan Smith whether the Government’s position was that a
second resolution was preferable or, as Ms Short had said, essential, Mr Blair replied:
“… we want a UN resolution. I have set out continually, not least in the House on
18 December [2002], that in circumstances where there was a breach we went back
to the UN and the spirit of the UN resolution was broken because an unreasonable
veto was put down, we would not rule out action. That is the same position that
everybody has expressed, and I think it is the right position. However … it is not
merely preferable to have a second resolution. I believe that we will get one.”
523.  In response to further questions from Mr Duncan Smith about differences within
the Cabinet, Mr Blair emphasised that the UN route had been chosen “very deliberately”
because it was “important” that Saddam Hussein was “disarmed with the support of the
international community”. He hoped that the House would unite around the position that,
if the UN resolution was breached, “action must follow, because the UN mandate has to
be upheld”.
524.  The Government’s position was that a “second UN resolution” was “preferable”,
but it had:
“… also said that here are circumstances in which a UN resolution is not necessary,
because it is necessary to be able to say in circumstances where an unreasonable
veto is put down that we would still act.”
525.  Mr Mohammad Sarwar (Labour) asked whether any breach of resolution 1441
should be a matter for the weapons inspectors and the Security Council, not President
Bush and the US Administration; and whether unilateral US action would be defying the
United Nations. Mr Blair replied that the UN inspectors “should be allowed to do their
job”, but they had only been able to return to Iraq because of the “firm stand” that had
been taken. It was “important” to “continue to send that signal of strength”. If Saddam
Hussein believed “for a single instance that the will of the international community
has abated … the consequences of either conflict or prolonged conflict” would be
“increased”.
526.  Asked by Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) how it could possibly be right to risk the
lives of British service men and women “on a venture in Iraq that does not have the

backing of international law, or the support of the majority of the British people”, Mr Blair
replied:
“… let us wait and see what happens in the coming weeks in relation to the United
Nations … [I]t is right that we are prepared to take action if necessary … because
weapons of mass destruction – the proliferation of … weapons and ballistic missile
technology … are a real threat to the security of the world and this country …. [W]e
have to deal with North Korea, but that is not a reason for failing to deal with Iraq.
“The truth is that this issue of weapons of mass destruction is a real threat to the
world. I believe … that it is only a matter of time before it is linked with international
terrorism. Does anyone believe that, if we do not take a stand … now in respect of
weapons of mass destruction, some terrorist group is not in future going to get hold
of that material and use it.
...
“This is a difficult time. I understand the concerns that some people have, but
sometimes the job of a Prime Minister is to say the things that others do not want
them to say but we believe are necessary to say because the threat is real and if
we do not deal with it the consequences of weakness will haunt future generations.”
527.  Other points made by Mr Blair included that, if Saddam Hussein wanted to avoid
conflict, he could “comply with the UN resolution, co‑operate with the inspectors, tell
us where this material is, and have it destroyed as it should be. Conflict would then
be avoided … The choice is now for Saddam.”

Concern that the US might act at the end of January
528.  Sir David Manning was assured by Dr Rice on 15 January that the US would
not take any further action with the Security Council until after the planned
meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at the end of January.
529.  Sir David told Dr Rice that public opinion had to be convinced that the
inspections process was serious and had produced serious evidence. The
UK needed timelines for decisions no earlier than March or April.
530.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on 15 January.183
531.  In the context of a visit to Washington by Dr Blix the previous day, Sir David and
Dr Rice discussed the relationship between the timelines for inspections set out in
resolutions 1284 (1999) and the requirements of resolution 1441. Sir David thought
that the issue could be “finessed”; and suggested that, when they met on 17 January,
Mr Blair might encourage Dr Blix to report to the Security Council “at regular intervals”
about Saddam Hussein’s compliance. Although that “was not stipulated in the

resolution”, it would be “hard for anyone to object” if Dr Blix agreed. The provisions of
resolution 1284 could “run in parallel”. Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed whether
Dr Blix could be encouraged to call for Saddam Hussein’s full co‑operation to resolve
the issues in his report to the Security Council.
532.  Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the “immediate tasks” for Dr Blix, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	

an audit of Iraq’s declaration;
an energetic programme of site inspections;
a process of interviews without minders; and
whether he should destroy proscribed items.

533.  They also discussed Iraq’s deceptions and concerns about whether UNMOVIC
could ensure that information about future inspections did not reach Iraqi officials.
534.  Sir David commented that, “as far as the battle for public opinion was concerned”,
the UK:
“… needed hard evidence that Saddam had WMD if we could possibly get it, which
meant allowing time for us to acquire and deploy the intelligence. There was a
suspicion in the UK that we were rushing our fences. It would be very difficult to
persuade people … that [the Security Council on] 27 January should do more than
take note of Dr Blix’s report … [I]t was too soon to try to use it as the moment when
we could demonstrate that the inspection system had failed.”
535.  Sir David asked Dr Rice about developments in her thinking about how the
US Administration would handle the meeting and immediate follow‑up. Dr Rice replied
that Secretary Powell would not present the US case on Iraq’s deception until after
the meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair on 31 January. President Bush
would “not want to give the impression that he was presenting the Prime Minister with
a fait accompli”.
536.  Sir David reported that he had welcomed that assurance, and pointed out that
Mr Blair had taken a very robust line at his press conference on 13 January; but “there
was nevertheless a great deal of uneasiness and opposition to Government policy …
We had to take account of this …”
537.  Sir David added that he had “repeated that this meant there was a premium on
producing hard evidence if we could, and allowing the inspection process more time.
This was also necessary if we were to get the support we needed for a second UNSCR.”
538.  Responding to Dr Rice’s view that President Bush would want to take advantage
of the current military window, Sir David had stated that he “realised this”, but “additional
days and weeks mattered in the battle for public opinion … the UK needed timeline[s] for
decisions that were no earlier than March or April, not January or February.”

96

539.  Sir David reported that, in the context of a discussion about France’s arguments for
more time and that war should be avoided to prevent a conflagration in the Middle East,
Dr Rice had said President Bush “was not prepared to wait for months and months”.
Sir David’s view was that:
“If military action proved necessary, it would be better to do it sooner rather than
later in terms of managing our relations with the Arab world … the argument for not
rushing our fences applied much more strongly to Western … countries. We had
to convince our public opinions that the inspection process was serious, that it had
produced serious evidence, and that this was the basis for a second resolution.”
540.  Sir David commented that he was “encouraged” by the response to his arguments
about “the political pressures and realities … and the need for time and evidence”.
541.  Mr Straw warned Sir David Manning on 16 January that the momentum
in Washington was to do something soon after 27 January, and it was being
assumed that Mr Blair would be with President Bush.
542.  Mr Straw recommended that Mr Blair should speak to President Bush.
543.  Sir David Manning agreed, reiterating his advice that more time was required.
544.  On 16 January, Mr Straw discussed the UK’s need for more time and “decisions
no earlier than March and April rather than January and February”, as Sir David Manning
had told Dr Rice the previous day, with Secretary Powell.184
545.  Reporting the conversation to Sir David, Mr Straw warned that the momentum in
Washington to do something soon after 27 January was “running very high”. It might
be “virtually impossible” for the US to follow the timetable of “no deadlines” set out in
resolution 1284.
546.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that there had been “unanimous support” for
Mr Blair’s position “after a good discussion in Cabinet”.
547.  Mr Straw also advised that assumptions were being made that Mr Blair would be
with President Bush “in any event”. The US could not create a Coalition without the UK;
and it would be hard to imagine the US taking military action without the UK.
548.  Mr Straw recommended that Mr Blair should talk to President Bush in the middle
of the following week “before the draft State of the Union speech is put to bed”.
549.  Sir David Manning told Mr Blair that he agreed with Mr Straw’s recommendation,
commenting that it would be easier for the UK if there were “major inspection
successes”.185 He also wrote: “Giving ourselves until March/April is a luxury we can

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

afford to get this right – particularly if the US [think] Saddam will rapidly collapse when
the blow comes.”

Cabinet, 16 January 2003
550.  As promised by Mr Blair on 19 December 2002, Cabinet discussed Iraq
on 16 January 2003.
551.  Mr Blair told Cabinet that the strategy remained to pursue the United Nations
course. The inspectors needed time to achieve results. If Iraq was not complying
with the demands of the UN, a second resolution would be agreed.
552.  Mr Straw stated that there was a good prospect of achieving a second
resolution. While sticking to the UN route, the UK should not rule out the
possibility of military action without a second resolution. Mr Blair repeated the
latter statement in his concluding remarks.
553.  At Cabinet on 16 January, Mr Blair said that:
“… he wanted to make the United Nations route work. The inspectors were doing
their job inside Iraq and he was optimistic that they would discover weapons of
mass destruction and their associated programmes which had been concealed.
They needed time to achieve results, including from better co‑ordinated intelligence.
If Iraq was not complying with the demands of the United Nations, he believed the …
Security Council would pass a second resolution.”186
554.  Mr Blair told his colleagues that evidence from the inspectors would make a veto of
a second resolution, by other Permanent Members of the Security Council, “less likely”:
“Meanwhile, British and American forces were being built up in the Gulf. If it came
to conflict, it would be important for success to be achieved quickly. The [military]
build up was having an effect on the Iraqi regime, with internal support dwindling for
President Saddam Hussein …”
555.  Mr Blair concluded by telling Cabinet that:
“The strategy remained to pursue the United Nations course. He would be meeting
President Bush to discuss Iraq at the end of the month, after Dr Blix had reported
to the Security Council on 27 January.”
556.  Mr Straw said that:
“… he was aware of anxieties about the possibility of having to diverge from the
United Nations path. There was a good prospect of achieving a second resolution.
Many had been doubtful about achieving the first resolution; in the event, the …
Security Council vote had been unanimous. While sticking with the United Nations
186 

Cabinet Conclusions, 16 January 2003.

98

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

route we should not rule out the possibility of military action without a second
resolution. Voting decisions in the Security Council could be driven by domestic
politics, not the demands of the international situation.”
557.  Mr Straw added that:
“In his recent contacts with the Muslim and Arab world, all could see the benefit of
Saddam Hussein’s demise. He had utterly rejected the notion that we were hostile
to Islam … Saddam Hussein had attacked his own people and his neighbours – all
of whom were Muslims.”
558.  Ms Short told the Cabinet that “keeping to the United Nations route would hold the
Government’s support together. She had been reviewing humanitarian scenarios for Iraq
and concluded that extra resources would be required, given the other humanitarian
priority of Southern Africa.”
559.  Ms Short added that the possibility “of chemical and biological weapons being used
inside Iraq, and their effect on local civilians”, was a “particularly worrying scenario”.
The involvement of the United Nations would be “essential” for the management of the
aftermath of military action: it would “provide legitimacy for the political and economic
reconstruction of Iraq, including the use of oil revenues. Work on the aftermath should
be taken forward urgently.”
560.  Points made during the discussion were:

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Communication “needed to be improved, on the basis of a core script”.
The message was “complex but should start from first principles; part of the
message was that the policy flowed from our own national interest and respect
for international law”. A “small proportion of the population would always be
opposed to military action, the political battle was for the centre ground which
could be won by argument”.
Although Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were “best able to speak from an
informed position, since they had access to the intelligence, Cabinet members
more generally needed to speak up for the Government’s policy on Iraq”.
The “leadership of the United States was not widely trusted” in the UK “but
President Bush’s resolve was weakening the Iraqi regime”.
“[T]he inspectors had only recently started their work and it was unreasonable
for opponents to assert that the absence of evidence so far meant that military
action was unjustified; once evidence of weapons of mass destruction was
produced, the public mood would change dramatically”.
Maintaining internal cohesion within the UK “was important, not least in respect
of the Islamic community”.
“[P]ushing the Middle East Peace Process forward remained an important part
of our policy, as was stability in the region”.

99

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

561.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said:
“… the strategy based on the United Nations route was clear, although the
uncertainties loomed large and there was a natural reluctance to go to war. It was
to be expected that the public would want the inspectors to find the evidence before
military action was taken. Pursuing the United Nations route was the right policy, but
we should not rule out the possibility of military action without a second resolution.
The priorities for the immediate future were:

•	
•	
•	

improved communications, which would set out the Government’s strategy and
be promoted by the whole Cabinet;
preparatory work on planning the aftermath of any military action and the role of
the United Nations in that, which should in turn be conveyed to the Iraqi people
so that they had a vision of a better life in prospect; and
contingency work on the unintended consequences which could arise from
the Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, environmental catastrophe or
internecine strife within Iraq.”

562.  Mr Campbell wrote that Cabinet was “fine”. In addition to the points recorded
in the minutes, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had said that:

•	
•	
•	

Russia was “closer to the Americans” than it said publicly and France did
“not particularly want to be left on the outside”: “But it was going to be tough.”
“In the meantime we build up our troops, and make sure that if it does come
to conflict we are able to get it over quickly.”
“… we had to stay close [to the US] publicly to maximise influence privately.”187

563.  Mr Campbell also wrote:

•	
•	

Mr Cook had said that “we were in a tremendous position in the UN”, thanks to
Mr Blair. The prospect of getting a second resolution was stronger if we did not
rule out doing without one.
Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Labour
Party, had “done a very passionate wind‑up”; the “discussion showed that there
was no real division ‘so let’s stop pretending there is”. The briefings had to stop.
The [Labour] Party didn’t “like the idea of intervention but sometimes we have
to make difficult judgements”.

564.  The discussion at Cabinet on 16 January took place at a key point in the
development of the UK’s position on Iraq and focused primarily on the role of
inspections, forthcoming diplomatic activity at the UN, the need for effective
communication of the Government’s position, and a high level discussion of
some of the possible consequences of military action.

565.  Mr Blair’s decision not to reveal that he had received Lord Goldsmith’s draft
advice, or that it concluded a further determination by the Security Council that
Iraq was in material breach of its obligations would be required to provide the
legal basis for military action, is addressed in Section 5.
THE DECISION TO DEPLOY GROUND FORCES
566.  Despite the imminence of the formal decision to offer a significant land
contribution Cabinet was informed only that forces were building up in the Gulf.
There is no evidence of any discussion of the nature and scale of the likely UK
contribution of ground forces or their imminent deployment.
567.  The formal proposal for the deployment was sent to Mr Blair later that
day. The absence of any formal collective discussion of the proposal by senior
Ministers before it was approved by Mr Blair is addressed in Sections 6.2 and 6.5.
568.  Nor did Cabinet discuss the strategic implications of making such a military
contribution, including the risks associated with military action and the potential
responsibilities which might be incurred.
569.  The need for such a discussion is addressed in Section 7.
570.  Although Mr Blair had said on 24 October 2002 that Cabinet would, “in due time”
be able to discuss the military options, and he had said on 9 January that the discussion
on 16 January would be an “in‑depth discussion” of Iraq, Cabinet was not told that the
imminent deployment of a large scale ground force to southern Iraq was under serious
consideration.
571.  The development of thinking in the MOD on the options for deploying a large
scale ground force for operations in southern Iraq, including the presentation to Mr Blair
on 15 January and his response, and the way in which the decision was then taken to
deploy UK forces, is described in detail Sections 6.1 and 6.2.
572.  Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 16 January seeking agreement to the “key role
in southern Iraq” proposed by the US for the UK:
“Important questions remain to be resolved … But the role proposed for the UK
is a sensible and significant one, and I recommend that with certain qualifications,
we accept it. We need to decide quickly.
“If you agree, I propose to announce the composition and deployment of the force
in an oral statement on Monday 20 January.”188
573.  Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Brown, Mr Straw and Sir Andrew Turnbull.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

574.  Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 17 January, flagging up three major issues: targeting;
the response to any Iraqi use of WMD; and the need for greater clarity on thinking and
plans for the aftermath.189
575.  Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair: “Good questions. But I don’t think they
affect your decision in principle.”190
576.  Mr Blair replied: “agreed”.191
577.  Late on 17 January, following a telephone conversation, Sir David replied
to Mr Watkins that Mr Blair was “content to proceed on the basis of the Defence
Secretary’s recommendations” and that he would be grateful “if you and the FCO would
now take things forward as proposed”.192
578.  Mr Hoon announced the deployment of UK ground forces, which would “include
the headquarters of 1 (UK) Armoured Division with support from 7 Armoured Brigade,
16 Air Assault Brigade and 102 Logistics Brigade”, in an oral statement in Parliament
on 20 January.193
579.  Asked whether Cabinet on 16 January might have been an opportunity for some
of the points from the MOD briefing on military options to be mentioned, Lord Turnbull
told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was:
“… very reluctant to discuss the military options …
“I could see he didn’t want key discussions of where we were going, through the
North or the South and who was going to bring what forces to bear where, and
there is some sense in that. But the strategic choices that they implied … didn’t get
discussed either. For example, the fact that if you have ground forces you become
an Occupying Power. I don’t remember someone saying ‘Wouldn’t it be better if we
just halted at Option 2, because then we will not be involved in being an Occupying
Power?’ ...”194
580.  Lord Turnbull subsequently added that Cabinet was given “Week by week progress
reports on the state of play of the inspections … That’s the bit they were actually rather
well‑informed about, much more so than on the military side.”195
581.  The absence of a collective discussion on the implications of the military
deployment is addressed in Section 7.

Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix, 17 January 2003
582.  In a meeting on 17 January, Mr Blair urged Dr Blix to tell Baghdad that this
was their last chance and the US was serious about military action. If Iraq was
co‑operating, the inspectors would need more time; if it was not, it would be better
to make that clear soon.
583.  Reporting on the discussion in the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 15 January, Mr Paul
Johnston, Head of the FCO Security Policy (Sec Pol) Department, informed Mr Straw
that it was UK information which had led to the discovery of SA‑2 (Volga) engines,
but “It was not yet clear whether they constituted a material breach.”196 The MOD was
considering providing additional interviewers to support UNMOVIC, “whose resources
were stretched. Evidence from Iraqi scientists might be the most likely basis for an
eventual material breach.”
584.  Mr Johnston also reported that the FCO was addressing “how far and how fast
the US might push to bring matters to a head in the Security Council if, after 27 January,
the Americans became concerned that ‘business as usual’ had set in”. Mr Blair’s visit
to the US at the end of January might be too late to influence the immediate US reaction
to the Council discussion. Mr Blair might try to call President Bush the following week.
585.  In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix on 17 January, the FCO advised
No.10 that:

•	

196 
197 

Dr Blix had made a “sound start in getting UNMOVIC operational”; the UK had
provided “considerable support, which we believe is beginning to show fruit”.
UK intelligence had helped UNMOVIC to discover illegally imported rocket engines.
The key message was the need for UNMOVIC to intensify its inspections, not
to focus exclusively on infrastructure, which was “often easy to conceal or move
around”, and to focus on interviews, both formal and informal, of Iraqi scientists.
The UK had doubts about the practicality of interviews outside Iraq but was
looking at ways to try to overcome those.
Expectations were “running high” for the 27 January meeting. The UK was
making clear that it was “not a deadline but a status report”. After that, while
the “strategy outlined in 1284” would give UNMOVIC “60 days to identify key
disarmament tasks”, the UK wanted to use the next phase to “put maximum
pressure on Iraq to co‑operate in answering all unresolved questions,
eg, including use of mobile laboratories”.
The UK thought Dr Blix should offer to brief the UN Security Council
more regularly, perhaps once a fortnight. That would include reporting illegal
imports for consideration of further action “even if there is no proven link to
illegal programmes”.197

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

586.  In response to a request from Sir David Manning for advice on interviews by
UN inspectors in Iraq, Mr Scarlett provided a brief co‑ordinated with the FCO, SIS, DIS
and OD Sec.198
587.  Mr Scarlett wrote that Iraq had deployed many subterfuges to interfere with the
interview process conducted by UNSCOM in the 1990s. Despite those efforts, UNSCOM
had “found interviews an extremely important tool, particularly on the biological warfare
programme, where the availability of other types of information was limited”.
588.  Mr Scarlett described measures currently being taken by Iraq to ensure that
interviews did not “succeed in uncovering prohibited activity”. The UK had provided a
database with about 6,000 names although information on individuals involved in WMD
activities post 1991 was limited. The UK was in the process of providing a shortlist
of “priority” candidates for interview, and had offered advice on interview techniques.
So far, only the IAEA had conducted two formal interviews; both had taken place in Iraq
and the individuals had asked for Iraqi officials to be present.
589.  Mr Scarlett concluded that interviews had the “potential, if conducted effectively,
to uncover gaps in Iraq’s cover story”. Iraq was “worried about this prospect”. The UK
was concerned that UNMOVIC and the IAEA lacked “the expertise necessary to use
this important tool effectively”. Mr Blair should press Dr Blix on the continuing need
for effective interviews.
590.  In their meeting on 17 January, Mr Blair urged Dr Blix to “give Baghdad a strong
message that this was their final chance and that the US were serious about military
action”.199 Mr Blair also underlined “the importance of the inspectors carrying out
interviews without minders” and offered UK help in identifying potential interviewees.
591.  Following further discussion of recent developments including the finds of shells
and documents the previous day, Mr Blair stated that “if Iraq was co‑operating then the
inspectors would need time to continue their work. But if Iraq was not co‑operating it
would be better to make that clear soon after 27 January, before the end of February.”
592.  Dr Blix said:
“[A]lthough the Iraqis gave prompt access, they did not seem sincere. They
did things for the media, eg a 12,000 page declaration that contained no new
substance … The Prime Minister concluded that if there were a major find Blix would
report it immediately, and if there were not a major find before 27 January Blix would
report then that his overall assessment was a lack of substantive co‑operation.
Blix agreed. He thought the Iraqis would prefer to deny access to the inspectors than
to be caught red‑handed; he would of course report either to the Security Council.”

Security Council, 20 January 2003
593.  Mr Straw warned a meeting of the Security Council on 20 January that
patience with Iraq had nearly run out.
594.  In a joint statement issued on 20 January, following a meeting in Baghdad to take
stock of inspections, UNMOVIC and the IAEA reported some progress on detailed
issues, including that “persons asked for interviews in private” would be “encouraged
to accept”.200
595.  Mr Campbell wrote that, at the No.10 morning meeting on 20 January, Mr Blair was
“becoming increasingly worried about Iraq. The whole question was what we did if and
when the US went without the UN.”201
596.  France as President of the Security Council had proposed a special,
Ministerial‑level meeting of the Council on 20 January, to discuss counter‑terrorism.
597.  In his speech to the Security Council, Mr Straw stated:
“… we have to expose the connection between the terrorists who respect no rules,
and the states which respect no rules. It is the leaders of rogue states who set the
example: brutalise their people; celebrate violence; provide a haven for terrorists
to operate; and, worse than that, through their chemical and biological weapons …
provide a tempting arsenal for terrorists to use …
“So … action to stop rogue states’ proliferation is as urgent as action to stop
terrorism … wherever we can, we should use diplomatic means to get proliferators
to comply as we are with North Korea … But there comes a moment when our
patience must run out.
“We are near that point with Iraq … so the moment of choice for Iraq is close.
He [Saddam Hussein] must either resolve this crisis peacefully, by the full and
active compliance with his Security Council obligations and full co‑operation with
inspectors, or face the ‘serious consequences’ – the use of force – which this
Council warned would follow when it passed [resolution] 1441.”202
598.  Mr McDonald reported that Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign Minister, had
told Mr Straw in the margins of the discussion that Germany would not vote for a second
resolution, even if there was clear evidence of a material breach; and that there were
no circumstances in which Germany would be involved in military action.203 Asked if he
really meant no circumstances, such as “some flagrant breach, a large find, the murder
of an inspector”, Mr Fischer replied that that “was different”, and Germany “might” vote
for a second resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

599.  In remarks to the press, Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign
Minister, condemned unilateral use of military force and stated that, as long as
progress was being made through inspections, France saw no reason to choose
military intervention.
600.  In his press conference after the meeting, Mr de Villepin stated that Iraq could not
be separated from other proliferation issues, and what was done on Iraq:
“… must apply to all the other crises. If war is the only way to resolve the problem,
we’re immediately forced down a blind alley. The international community must
clearly demonstrate initiative and imagination. We must also maintain international
unity. Unilateral military intervention must be perceived as a victory for the maxim
‘might is right’, an attack against the primacy of the law and international morality.”204
601.  Mr de Villepin stated that the international community had chosen inspections,
and Iraq had to understand that it was “high time that she co‑operated actively”. Iraq’s
weapons of mass destruction programmes had “essentially been halted, even frozen”.
In his view, Iraq could be disarmed by peaceful means.
602.  In response to questions, Mr de Villepin stated that there was a choice between
continuing with co‑operation and “military intervention because we are impatient”.
France believed that “nothing today justifies envisaging military action”. The inspectors
had been working for “fewer than 60 days” and progress was “satisfactory”, although
there was more that could be done to seek Iraq’s active co‑operation.
603.  Mr de Villepin raised questions about the legitimacy and effectiveness of any US
unilateral military action, and warned of the potential consequences for a united Iraq
and a stable and safe region in the Middle East. France’s view was that it would “take
us down a path where we would have no control over the gains and benefits”.
604.  Asked if France would use her veto, Mr de Villepin responded that President
Chirac had “said from the outset” that France would not “join in military action” that did
not have:
“… the support of the international community, UN support. Moreover we
believe military intervention would be the worst solution, and that the use of force
can only be a last resort, implying that all other avenues have been exhausted. If
that point is reached, France, as a Permanent Member of the Security Council, will
shoulder her responsibilities, remaining true to her principles … so long as progress
can be made through co‑operation with inspectors, there is no reason to choose …
military intervention …”
605.  In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that Mr de Villepin’s comments about the unilateral
use of force “had effectively denounced the US”.205 That had “soured relations especially
with Colin [Powell]”.

606.  Mr Straw also wrote that the special Ministerial meeting of the Security Council,
and the three that followed in a seven‑week period, were “among the most serious and
dramatic meetings in which I have ever been involved”.

The positions of other members of the Security Council
607.  President Bush stated on 21 January that it was clear Saddam Hussein was
not disarming and time was running out.
608.  Sir David Manning was assured by Dr Rice that the US wanted a second
resolution.
609.  In a press conference following a meeting with leading economists at the White
House on 21 January, President Bush was asked if he was frustrated by the French
“saying that they would block a UN resolution authorizing force on Iraq”. He replied
that Saddam Hussein possessed “some of the world’s deadliest weapons” and posed
“a serious threat to America and our friends and allies”. The world, including France, had
come together “to say he must disarm”. But he was “not disarming”, he was “delaying …
deceiving … asking for time”. He was “playing hide‑and‑seek with the inspectors”.
The US “in the name of peace” would “continue to insist” that he did disarm.206
610.  Asked when he intended to take a decision about whether the inspection process
had any real hope of disarming Saddam, President Bush replied:
“It’s clear to me now that he is not disarming … Surely we have learned how this
man deceives and delays. He’s giving people the run‑around … time is running
out … Make no mistake … he will be disarmed.”
611.  President Bush concluded that Saddam Hussein had:
“… been given ample time to disarm. We have had ample time now to see that …
he’s employing the tricks of the past …
“He wants to focus the attention of the world on inspectors. This is not about
inspectors; this is about a disarmed Iraq …
“… this looks like a rerun of a bad movie and I’m not interested in watching it.”
612.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that President Bush’s remarks were a “clear
message that [the US was] losing patience with the UN, and they had pretty much
decided it was going to happen and that was that”. Mr Blair “felt there had definitely been
a change in mood and it was pretty bad”; President Bush needed to do more to make it
an international coalition.207

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

613.  Secretary Powell wrote in 2012:
“In January 2003, as war with Iraq was approaching, we needed to present our case
against Iraq to the public and the international community. By then the President
did not think that war could be avoided. He had crossed the line in his own mind,
even though the NSC [National Security Council] had never met – and never would
meet – to discuss the decision.”208
614.  Following the debate at the UN on 20 January, Sir David Manning spoke again
to Dr Rice.209 He reported that opinion polls in the UK showed that “over 60 percent” of
those questioned would “accept” military action if mandated by a second UN resolution,
but the figures “plummeted to near single figures without one”. He reported that he had
been assured that the US Administration wanted a second resolution.
615.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the “vast majority” of the Security
Council believed that the inspectors should be given more time, although many
were also sceptical of Iraqi co‑operation.
616.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock chaired an informal discussion of Security Council
members on 21 January, which he described as to report on the discussion between
Dr Blix and Mr Blair on 17 January. Sir Jeremy had stated that the UK continued to feed
the inspectors with information on a “one way basis” and there was a “good chance”
that, as the inspectors got closer to Iraq’s proscribed activities, more information would
come out of the system:
“Iraq was therefore taking an amazing risk by trying to conceal its WMD. The
Iraqis had to realise that there was only one way to avoid complete disarmament
through military action – much more pro‑active co‑operation. If they did not provide
that co‑operation they would themselves be choosing to realise the threat of
military action.”210
617.  Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte had stated that the situation
could not be allowed to drag on; and that he was talking about days, not weeks or
months. It was for Iraq to prove to the Council it was complying, not the other way
round. The French Deputy Permanent Representative had argued that simply saying
that co‑operation was insufficient was not enough; demonstrable, precise evidence
was needed to justify war, not become a prisoner of the military build‑up. That could
be hours, but it could also be months or years.
618.  Sir Jeremy stated that the “vast majority” of Security Council members believed
that “inspections should be given more time, although many are also sceptical of
Iraqi co‑operation”.

619.  In a separate telegram, Sir Jeremy Greenstock warned that “the terms of the
Iraq debate are not moving in our favour … most Council members are focused on
giving more time to inspections not on the Iraqi failure to disarm”.211 He highlighted
key areas for discussion at the Security Council meetings on 27 and 29 January, and
wrote: “If UNMOVIC can produce the evidence of Iraqi biological or chemical weapons
in particular … we have a very good chance of turning Council opinion back towards
a second resolution.”
620.  Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, advised that the gap
between the UK and French positions was “unbridgeable”. President Chirac was
strongly opposed to war and thought it would have disastrous consequences.
France also questioned the level of threat posed by Iraq.
621.  On 21 January, Sir John Holmes wrote to Sir David Manning setting out his
perspective on the French position.212 Sir John Holmes acknowledged that France would
try “to avoid having to veto” and noted that “opportunities to push Chirac in our direction
may arise as circumstances change”.
622.  Sir John reported that President Chirac strongly opposed war and that for him
preventing it was more important than disarming Saddam Hussein. It would be very
difficult to persuade President Chirac to:
“… support a second resolution and participate in war short of a new and evident
casus belli. He may well accept the pain of exclusion from the action than change
this position, though he has yet to face up to this choice and hopes to avoid it.
The driving force of Chirac’s policy is to avoid a war at almost any cost. He does
not believe it is necessary/proportionate to the real threat. He fears disastrous
consequences in the region for the MEPP, for the US‑Western image more widely,
and for further fuelling of terrorism …”
623.  Sir John reported that terrorism was perceived as the most urgent threat which the
French thought was in danger of being neglected. President Chirac was also “seriously
concerned” about the effect on the world economy and the impact of that on France’s
economic recovery. Beyond those concerns, Sir John described President Chirac as
wanting to demonstrate a different, multilateralist world view and preserve French
influence through keeping the main decisions in the Security Council. President Chirac
did not really believe Saddam Hussein was a threat although WMD more widely were.
624.  Sir John Holmes described French tactics as to “encourage international pressure
against the war, to argue for more time, to help the inspectors do their work, and
to put more pressure on Saddam to co‑operate”. Sir John advised that President
Chirac did not believe there was anything seriously incriminating to find; a view which

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Sir John reported was “widely shared here”. Secondly, President Chirac thought Iraq’s
concealment techniques would be “too good for the inspectors”. Thirdly, if inspectors did
find something, the French were bound to argue, at least in the first place, that it showed
the inspections were doing their job, making war unnecessary.
625.  Sir John predicted that:
“If Saddam manifestly blocks the inspectors, with or without a major find, but more
obviously with, the French will probably concede that he has had his chance and
blown it, vote for a second resolution … and take part [in military action].
“If the inspectors find something big, the French will first argue for the continuation
of inspections; but if it is a plausible smoking gun, and it is clear the US (and we) are
committed to military action, again they will probably commit to a second resolution
and to take part. But they will try everything to find alternatives …
“If there is no major obstruction and no smoking gun, France will oppose a second
resolution (while trying to avoid having to veto) and stay out of military action,
though they would probably at the end of day try to sound neutral … Continuing
Iraqi deception and only passive co‑operation … will almost certainly not be enough
to persuade them to change this in the short term …”
626.  Sir John wrote:
“As things stand, there is a relatively narrow window of circumstances in which
the French would take part fully in military action: a clear casus belli and a second
resolution. This looks to me possible in the next few weeks but not probable. Short
of that, they will not go with the Americans, though they could stop short of outright
opposition and be ready to do something to help eg backfilling.”
627.  Sir John added that “The consequences for France of not being there if the US go
are painful for them to contemplate”, including being on the wrong side of the argument
if the action is an obvious rapid success. But:
“There would be consolations if the Americans had no or few allies … And if it all
went wrong, they would be on the right side of the argument.”
628.  Addressing the implications for UK policy, Sir John wrote that “the gap between
the Prime Minister’s convictions and Chirac’s is, for the present, unbridgeable”. He saw
“no alternative to massaging our differences … and staying within shouting distance of
each other”.
629.  Sir John concluded that, if the UK and the French (and Germans) diverged over
military action, the consequences would depend:
“… on the circumstances and the success of the war. But the implications for the
successful pursuit of our European policy … could be severe … So if any chance
emerges in the next few weeks of bringing our positions together, we should grab
it with both hands.”
110

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

630.  In advance of the Security Council meeting on 27 January, Mr Straw and the
FCO were concerned to identify a strategy which would allow more time for the
strategy of coercion to work.
631.  Mr Straw visited Washington and repeated the political arguments for trying
to get a second resolution on 23 January.213
632.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the inspectors’ reports to the Security
Council on 27 January, the need to “shift the burden of proof to Iraq” and the need to
ensure there were no differences between the US and UK.214
633.  Mr Straw made the case for a second resolution in his subsequent meeting with
Mr Dick Cheney, US Vice President, telling him that “the key question was how to
navigate the shoals between where we were today and a possible decision to take
military action”.215 The UK would be “fine” if there was a second resolution; and that it
would be “ok if we tried and failed (a la Kosovo). But we would need bullet‑proof jackets
if we did not even try”. In response to Vice President Cheney’s question whether it would
be better to try and fail than not to try at all, Mr Straw said the former.
634.  In the subsequent discussion, Mr Straw stated that:

•	
•	

•	
•	

•	

The composition of the Security Council since 1 January “made matters
more difficult”.
If there were “a half decent statement” from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei (to the
Security Council on 27 January), “which enumerated Iraqi shortcomings, we
would have the beginnings of a further material breach as defined by OP4 of
[resolution] 1441. We could then use a period of time – weeks not months – to
negotiate a second resolution.” The text of such a resolution would “write itself”.
The effort of getting a second resolution “would help the UK and – he thought –
the US to nail the canard that the US was operating outside the international
community. It would also help with the ‘day‑after’.”
Mr Blair “felt strongly that diplomatic effort could make the military effort
easier. If the international community was united, then the Arabs could go to
Saddam with a strong message that he had either to go or his regime would
face destruction. Arab leaders were desperate to get rid of Saddam. A second
resolution would embolden them.” If the international community was split, that
would “embolden Saddam Hussein”.
People in the UK had a “sense of the UN as a legitimator of action”.
Vice President Cheney said the same was true in the US.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

635.  Vice President Cheney made a number of points, including:

•	
•	

A French veto “wouldn’t hurt one bit in the States”.

•	

The US Administration “had not yet figured out next steps”, which would
“to some extent” depend on what happened on 27 January.

•	
•	

•	

•	
•	

Secretary Powell had felt “bushwhacked” at the meeting of the Security Council
on 20 January, and the position of Germany was “increasingly fragile”.

It “would clearly be preferable to get a second resolution”. There was a “sense
in the US that a process was unfolding”, “But there was no prospect of the
inspectors working properly unless the party inspected was willing. The burden
of proof was on the Iraqis and they were not delivering.”
There was “a timing problem. The idea that we could let it drift through months
of discussion was not on. Troops were already in place. The weather was a
factor … If we backed off now, or sat there for months, the Saudis and others
would back off. It would be one more example of bold talk and no action. We
would never get them gingered up for action again.”
President Bush “could not let a charade continue at the UN”; and he “could not
let France and Germany dictate policy”. He would have thought France had “a
vested interest … in preserving the status of the Security Council”, but “Instead,
they were allowing the Council to be a place not of action but of restraining
legitimate US action.”
Once military operations started, “the Iraqi regime was likely to fall apart quickly”:
“Iraqis would reveal all the WMD now hidden away.”
The US Administration “had not yet resolved” whether it wanted a second vote
or not.

636.  At the end of the meeting, Mr Straw:
“… discussed the Kosovo model and its limitations. The tactics of tabling a text in the
knowledge of a likely veto were very delicate. But we might also face the situation
where France or Germany tabled a resolution to give the inspectors more time.
We would have to veto but that would put us on the back foot. Last autumn, the
knowledge that the US and UK had a text in play had deterred others from tabling an
alternative [...] …”
637.  Mr Straw’s comments on proceeding with military action if the UK tried and
failed to obtain a second resolution prompted Mr Wood to write to Mr Straw.216 That
correspondence and Lord Goldsmith’s subsequent correspondence with Mr Straw are
addressed in Section 5.

638.  On a flight from Washington on 23 January, Mr Ricketts, gave Mr Straw an outline
of a strategy which Mr Blair could put to President Bush.217
639.  The key messages were that the strategy was working, but it needed more time.
That would have three strategic advantages:

•	
•	
•	

The military build‑up was “already producing signs of fracturing in the regime …
We might be able to achieve our objectives without firing a shot”;
Inspections “were beginning to produce results”.
The UK was working with “moderate Arabs” to “get Saddam out using the
leverage of a second resolution”.

640.  Mr Ricketts stated that:

•	
•	
•	

In the present circumstances, it was clear that there would not be the nine votes
in the Security Council needed for a second resolution.
Without a “dramatic new fact”, Mr Ricketts did not see how a second resolution
could be achieved “in the next few weeks”.
“UK politics [made] it essential to have a second resolution”.

641.  In Mr Ricketts’ view, the US and UK had to “contrive the circumstances” in which
they could “carry a broad coalition and domestic opinion with us. Going without the UN
carried the big price of resentment in the Muslim world, including increased terrorism/
risk of being stuck for years with the burden of rebuilding post‑Saddam Iraq.” Working
with the UN would allow Iraq to be “rebuilt with international support” which would allow
the UK “to exit”, and would be a “powerful message for other would‑be proliferators. That
prize is worth taking time over.”

Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, 24 January 2003
642.  Mr Blair decided on 23 January to ask President Bush for a few weeks’ delay
to maximise the chances of finding a “smoking gun” as the basis for a second
resolution.
643.  Mr Campbell wrote that on 22 January he and Baroness Morgan, Mr Blair’s
Director of Political and Government Relations, had “banged on” about the need for the
US to be on a “broader international route” and that Mr Blair:
“… sensed the inspectors would not necessarily come out with what was needed for
absolute clarity, so we would have to face the prospect of going in without a UNSCR.
Chirac was making it clearer than ever that he would be against war come what
may, even with a smoking gun.”218

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

644.  Mr Campbell also wrote:

•	
•	
•	

He had also discussed the problems for the UK caused by the US focus on their
domestic audience with the US.
Baroness Morgan had warned Mr Blair that the PLP needed UN support, and
they had to see real evidence.
Mr Blair had been “pretty clear that we couldn’t peel off from the US without very
good reason”.

645.  In a meeting with Sir Jeremy Greenstock and No.10 officials to discuss the
handling of Iraq in the UN Security Council in the coming weeks, at 9.30am on
23 January, Mr Blair set out an approach which included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

There was a need “if we could possibly get it” for “hard proof” that Saddam
Hussein was “lying over his WMD, to bring public opinion to accept the need
for military action”; and that inspections would need to be given time.
In their planned meeting (on 31 January), Mr Blair would seek to convince
President Bush to delay a decision to start military action for a few weeks.
Confirmation was needed that the assumption that the Arabs, and in particular
the Saudis, would only favour military action on the basis of a second resolution,
was correct.
The “extra time should be used to maximise the chances of the inspectors
finding a smoking gun or of being seriously obstructed (the inspectors should be
encouraged to inspect sites which we knew the Iraqis would want to block)”.
The “less optimal outcome would be no smoking gun and no serious obstruction
but a series of regular Blix reports that he was not satisfied with the level of Iraqi
co‑operation”.
The “extra time would also give the Arabs the opportunity to press Saddam to
go into exile”.
The argument needed to be made that “the inspectors were not supposed to
be a detective agency … South Africa was a model of how it could be done.”219

CABINET, 23 JANUARY 2003
646.  Mr Blair told Cabinet that a “big debate was developing over the value
of the inspections route” and that he would “report back” after his meeting with
President Bush at the end of January.
647.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 23 January that his meeting with Dr Blix on 17 January
had confirmed that Iraq was not co‑operating fully with the UN.220 The Security Council
meeting on 27 January would not be a “trigger date”; the “inspectors had to continue
their work”. The military build‑up was under way and Saddam Hussein was “under
increasing pressure”.

648.  Mr Blair also said that “A big debate was developing over the value of the
inspections route.” He would “report back to colleagues on the outcome” of his meeting
with President Bush.
649.  Sir Richard Dearlove advised on 23 January that the US had “in effect” taken
the decision to use force against Iraq.
650.  In response to a request from Mr Blair for briefing on US planning, Sir Richard
Dearlove’s Private Secretary sent Sir David Manning an update, advising that a decision
had “in effect” been taken to use force against Iraq.221 The US military would be ready
in mid‑February.
MR BLAIR’S NOTE TO PRESIDENT BUSH, 24 JANUARY 2003
651.  In a Note to President Bush on 24 January, Mr Blair told President Bush that
the need for a second resolution was overwhelming, and that inspectors should
be given until the end of March or early April to carry out their task.
652.  Mr Blair suggested that, in the absence of a “smoking gun”, Dr Blix would
be able to harden up his findings on the basis of a pattern of non‑co‑operation
from Iraq and that would be sufficient for support for military action in the
Security Council.
653.  In addition, Mr Blair framed his argument in the context that extra time would
be crucial to make a better case and work up coherent plans for the “aftermath”
of a conflict and to secure international support.
654.  Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush on 24 January, setting out the dilemma,
as he saw it, in the absence of a “smoking gun”.222
655.  Addressing the question “What’s the problem?”, Mr Blair wrote:
“If we delay, we risk Saddam messing us about, sucking us back into a game of hide
and seek with the Inspectors where, unless they find ‘the smoking gun’, the thing
drags on for ever until we give up or get distracted.
“On the other hand, at present there is not support for a second UN resolution; and
Blix is not yet in a clear and unambiguous position on Iraqi non‑co‑operation.”
656.  Mr Blair wrote that the arguments for proceeding with the second resolution, “or at
the very least a clear statement” from Dr Blix which allowed the US and UK to argue that
a failure to pass a second resolution was in breach of the spirit of 1441, remained in his
view, overwhelming. He cited six reasons:

•

It would be “the best protection” in the event of “a military hitch” or a
protracted campaign.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	

Given the risk of casualties, military and civilian, “doing this in the context of
international opposition would be very tough”.
Arab opinion wanted “it done”, and wanted “it done quickly”, but they were
assuming a second resolution: “Without one they will be in a real bind, especially
if parts of Europe, Russia, China, etc were all vociferous in their opposition.”
Saddam Hussein would be “emboldened by a lack of international support for us
and weakened by its existence”. If he believed international opinion was against
the US and UK, he might hunker down in Baghdad.
Internecine fighting in Iraq when a military strike destabilised the regime would
be the “biggest risk”: “They are perfectly capable, on previous form, of killing
each other in large numbers.” The US and UK “would need the backing of the
international community and preferably the UN to handle it”; without that the
US and UK would “get the blame for any fighting”.
If they forfeited the UN route, the US and UK would lose the high ground.
They had “invested huge capital” in that and it had given everyone “a big
comfort blanket”. If that were taken away, it would be “about US power, naked
and in your face”. There were “big majorities against action without UN backing
everywhere, even in the UK” and “even in the UK Cabinet”. That would be “so
in spades” if the UN inspectors appeared to be asking for more time and the
US and UK were refusing.

657.  Addressing the “way through”, Mr Blair wrote:
“In truth, the world is in contradiction. No one is really prepared for war, except us.
But equally no one believes Saddam is telling the truth. In part we are victims of our
own success. Your strength … has forced Saddam to let inspectors back in; has
made him seem weak and back in his box. So, everyone asks: why bother?
“But they also know, deep down, WMD is an issue and that given half a chance
Saddam would be at it again. And they don’t want, ideally to fall out with the US.
But to avoid falling out, they need some cover.”
658.  Mr Blair described the position of France and Germany as being that the inspectors
were in Iraq “to play hide and seek”, and “they should stay as long as it takes for them to
find anything without any obligation on Saddam other than not to hinder them”.
659.  The “true view”, however, was that resolution 1441 gave Iraq a “duty” to
“co‑operate fully: not just in access, but in being open, honest and transparent about
where WMD was and actively helping the inspectors to seize and destroy it”. Dr Blix
accepted that view:
“… if things carry on as they are, then he will say that there is not full co‑operation
though there is not either the absence of any co‑operation; but as he continues
to demand Iraq fully co‑operates and they continue to refuse, this pattern of
non‑co‑operation – even in the absence of any ‘smoking gun’ is sufficient for him
to harden up his findings; and I think it will be sufficient for us.”
116

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

660.  Mr Blair added:
“ie in the US/UK view, the failure … fully to co‑operate is enough now and technically
we are right. 27 January should be crunch time. But we won’t carry other people …
However, if Blix carries on reporting non‑co‑operation, makes increasing demands,
and hardens his findings with each stage, I think we will carry people – even without
the ‘smoking gun’ – shortly.”
661.  Mr Blair stated that military action starting at the end of March/early April would not
be “a big military problem”: “But the extra time could be crucial in carrying international
opinion” with the US and the UK, provided they had defined clearly the true role of the
inspections and Dr Blix was behind the proposal.
662.  Mr Blair’s proposal was for:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

a report on 27 January stating that Dr Blix was not satisfied and identifying
specific questions for Iraq to address;
the US and UK to set out “the true role” of the inspectors and get Dr Blix’s
support, saying that they believed “Iraq is in breach but even so, out of
deference to allies, we are prepared to give the inspectors some time”;
Dr Blix to agree to report every two weeks;
the US and UK to make it clear that, if by the time of the late March report there
was not a definitive change of Iraqi attitude, the US and UK would take the issue
back to the UN and expect action; and
regular reports from Dr Blix in February and March to build “a clear pattern
of deceit”.

663.  Mr Blair argued that the disadvantages of that strategy would be military delay but
“only, effectively, for a month”. The advantages would be “huge”, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The US and UK could “build a case based on the Inspectors not just our own
judgement”.
Dr Blix might find “the smoking gun”.
Saddam “might crack”.
There would be “a far better chance of a second resolution” which would give
them “a clear run with public support”.
The Saudis and other Arabs could “build support for their strategy to push
Saddam out”.
It would provide time, which Mr Blair believed was needed, “to work up more
coherent post‑Saddam and ‘aftermath’ plans”.
It would also provide time “to make a bigger case on WMD and the link
with terrorism”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

664.  Mr Blair concluded: “In parallel we should of course maintain our rhetoric and step
up military preparations.”
665.  Mr Campbell wrote that the Note was “a very well made, carefully constructed
argument that made sense”, and that President Bush had read it before the telephone
call with Mr Blair.223
666.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice about the Note.224 He reported that it was clear
that the White House had a different perspective about the advantages of moving to
military action as soon as possible and the importance of a second resolution, including
for securing support from Arab governments.
667.  In his subsequent conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair pursued the
proposals in his Note and explained his political difficulties.
668.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later that day, he set out the strategy
in his Note and his view on the dilemma they faced.225 The international community
was “not yet ready” for a second resolution, but an operation without one would be
“much tougher”.
669.  Mr Blair said that it was possible that the inspectors would find a smoking gun,
but he was “not relying on that”. In his view, even if there were no smoking gun and the
Iraqis were giving the inspectors access, Dr Blix:
“… would say that they were not co‑operating sufficiently. Saddam had to co‑operate
actively with identifying and destroying all his WMD … So in our view Saddam was
already in breach of 1441. But the international community was in denial. Our case
would strengthen if there were a series of Blix reports that Iraq was not co‑operating.
We needed to give the inspectors more time to firm up the case.”
670.  Mr Blair proposed setting a clear deadline. Unless there were full co‑operation
by then, we would seek a second resolution: “If this were not achievable, military action
would follow anyway.” Military preparations and diplomatic work to build international
support should continue.
671.  Later Mr Blair argued that “we needed to look reasonable” and that the deadline
for the start of military action should be delayed to the end of March.
672.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been clear that there was no international
political support “without Blix finding a smoking gun and we needed more time”.
The inspectors should be given another month. Mr Blair was “sure that in time we could
turn opinion”. President Bush was “pretty clear there would have to be war, because

he did not believe Saddam would ever comply, or that the inspectors would be allowed
to do their job”.226
673.  The record of the discussion confirms Mr Campbell’s account.227
674.  In response to a question from Mr Campbell about whether he thought President
Bush “had basically decided there was going to be a war,” Mr Blair had said “if that call
was anything to go by, pretty much”, Mr Blair hoped that “he could keep things on a
multilateral track but it was not going to be easy. He was facing a very tough call indeed,
about as tough as they get.”228
675.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair “was confident that we could get Bush to the
position where he stayed [action] long enough for a second UNSCR”; and that there
was also “a real danger that the Attorney General would resign if he thought the plan
was disproportionate force”.
676.  Mr Campbell reported that Mr Blair had told a political Cabinet on 24 January that
“it was important to stay with the Americans”. He had emphasised “closeness as a way
of influencing the debate there” and said “he wanted to do a big … diplomacy round”
before his meeting with President Bush. Mr Blair had also:
“… set out what he saw as the political and other realities. He felt that Bush
deserved praise for showing strength in forcing Saddam to the position of getting
the inspectors in, but … we didn’t have enough international support and we needed
time to build it.”
677.  Describing the political Cabinet on 24 January, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Prescott
had said more Cabinet Committee discussion on policy was needed.
678.  In a conversation with Mr de Villepin on 24 January, Mr Straw said that it was
“important for everyone to keep to the process” set out in resolution 1441.229 That was
“the guide against which we could test whether the inspectors had been able to do their
job or not”. He restated the UK’s preference for a second resolution.
679.  Mr Straw said that “how France played its hand had major consequences”. It was
vital to take the UN route. Citing the League of Nations in the 1930s, he said that “failure
by the UN would lead to questions about its legitimacy”. After complaining about the
US approach, Mr de Villepin stated that if in the end it was decided force was needed,
“France would join in”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

INDICT
INDICT was established in 1996.230 Although it was UK based, the non‑governmental
organisation (NGO) operated with funding from the US Congress granted under the
auspices of the Iraq Liberation Act 1998. INDICT advocated the establishment of an
ad hoc International Criminal Tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and leading members
of his regime on charges of genocide and torture, war crimes and other crimes against
humanity. Founder members included a number of notable Iraqi exiles including
Dr Ahmed Chalabi and Mr Hamid Al Bagali (who was later appointed Iraqi Ambassador
to the UN), and Ms Clwyd.
INDICT focused its attention on Saddam Hussein and a dozen senior members of the
Iraqi regime including Mr Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister.231
Ms Clwyd wrote to Lord Williams of Mostyn, the Attorney General, in September 2000,
enclosing a copy of Leading Counsel’s opinion which advised that there was “a powerful
body of evidence that Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz were party to, and criminally
responsible for … detentions” and that there was “direct evidence that implicates Saddam
Hussein and Tariq Aziz in issuing threats to detain the hostages”.232
Counsel advised that, subject to the consent of the Attorney General being obtained,
both Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz could be charged in the UK with the offence of
Hostage Taking, contrary to section 1 of the Taking of Hostages Act 1982. That was an
offence prosecutable in the UK whether committed “in the United Kingdom or elsewhere”
regardless of the nationality of the offender.
Lord Williams wrote to Ms Clwyd on 22 March 2001 notifying her of his refusal to grant his
consent to the prosecution.233 He explained the basis of his decision as:
“I have concluded in respect of Saddam Hussein that there is at present no realistic
prospect of a conviction. There are two elements to my assessment. I have
concluded that Saddam Hussein, as Head of State of Iraq, would presently be
entitled to assert immunity from criminal prosecution. Moreover, I am not satisfied
in any event that the evidence as submitted to me is sufficient to provide a realistic
prospect of a conviction.
“Whether the court would uphold any claim of immunity that may be asserted by
Tariq Aziz is in my judgement less clear. However, leaving that issue aside, I am
not satisfied that the evidence at present submitted by INDICT provides a realistic
prospect of conviction for the offences which appear to me to fall to be considered.”
In October 2002, INDICT submitted further advice from Leading Counsel to
Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, again seeking consent to the prosecution of
Saddam Hussein, Tariq Aziz and on this occasion two others, Mr Ali Hassan Al‑Majid
(who was said to have been appointed the Governor of Kuwait) and Mr Taha Ramadan,

the Vice President of Iraq, (characterised by INDICT as the “second most powerful man
in Iraq”).234 All were alleged to have committed offences of hostage‑taking in 1990.
Lord Goldsmith wrote to Ms Clwyd on 24 January 2003.235 He stated that he was
not prepared to consent to a prosecution on the “theoretical possibility” that Saddam
Hussein’s “current immunity could at some point lapse” particularly, in the light of
the Yerodia236 decision which implied that the formal grant of his consent might itself
contravene the basis of his immunity. Lord Goldsmith was not satisfied, moreover, that
the evidence submitted by INDICT provided a realistic prospect of conviction.
Lord Goldsmith did not express a view as to whether Tariq Aziz might continue to enjoy
immunity. In his case, and with regard to Ali Hassan Al‑Majid and Taha Ramadan, he did
not consider the evidence to be sufficiently cogent or persuasive for there to be a realistic
prospect of a conviction and Lord Goldsmith refused consent in each case.
Lord Goldsmith closed his letter with the following paragraph:
“My conclusions on the material provided, focus only on the question of exercising
criminal jurisdiction against individuals in the domestic courts. They have nothing
to do, of course, with the quite separate question of whether the international
community may in due course consider it worthwhile to establish an international
tribunal, depending on how the international situation develops. An international
tribunal can be set up on a basis that overrides Sovereign immunity. But this is not
a matter for me and it would not be right for me to speculate as to how the situation
will develop over the next few weeks or months.”

Mr Blair’s interview on BBC’s Breakfast with Frost, 26 January 2003
680.  Mr Blair decided to use an interview on Breakfast with Frost on 26 January
to set out the position that the inspections should be given sufficient time to
determine whether or not Saddam Hussein was co‑operating fully. If he was
not, that would be a sufficient reason for military action. A find of WMD was
not required.
681.  In an extended interview on the BBC’s Breakfast with Frost programme on
26 January, Mr Blair set out in detail his position on Iraq.237
682.  Asked whether Dr Blix should be given more time, Mr Blair stated that the
inspectors had “to be given the time to do the job”, but there was “confusion” about what
that job was. The time they needed was to certify whether Saddam Hussein was “fully
co‑operating or not”. Saddam had to provide information on “exactly what weapons
material” he had, “allowing the inspectors to inspect it, monitor it and shut it down”.
If they were not able to do that job, Saddam would have to be disarmed by force. That
should not take months, but Saddam was not co‑operating.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

683.  Pressed as to whether non‑compliance rather than evidence of weapons of mass
destruction justified “a war”, Mr Blair replied that he “profoundly” disagreed with the idea
that a refusal to co‑operate was of a “lesser order”. He added:
“… what we know is that he has this material … we know there is something
like 350 tonnes of chemical warfare agent. We know there is something like
30,000 special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological weapons.
“He hasn’t even told us where those old leftovers from 1998 are … we know … that
there is an elaborate process … of concealment …
“… the people that the inspectors want to interview … are being told, by the Iraqi
authorities, they can only come for interviews with an Iraqi … minder, and only be
interviewed in certain places.
“And we know also from intelligence that these people’s families are being told that
if they co‑operate and give any information at all they will be executed.
“… if he fails to co‑operate in being honest and he is pursuing a programme of
concealment, that is every bit as much a breach as finding, for example, a missile
or chemical agent.”
684.  Asked whether there would be “another dossier” setting out what UK intelligence
had discovered, Mr Blair stated:
“… we have the intelligence that says that Saddam has continued to develop these
weapons of mass destruction; that what he’s doing is using a whole lot of dual‑use
facilities in order to manufacture chemical and biological weapons; and … that there
is an elaborate programme of concealment … forcing the inspectors to play a game
of hide and seek.”
685.  Asked if he had sufficient evidence to back action, Mr Blair replied:
“… I’ve got no doubt at all that he’s developing these weapons and that he poses
a threat but we made a choice to go down the UN route …
“… our judgement, the American judgement … is that Saddam has these weapons,
but the purpose of the inspectors … is … to report back to the UN and say whether
he is fully co‑operating or he’s not.”
686.  Asked whether a second resolution was needed, required or preferred,
Mr Blair replied:
“Of course we want a second resolution and there is only one set of circumstances
in which I’ve said that we would move without one … all this stuff that … we’re
indifferent … is nonsense. We’re very focused on getting a UN resolution …
“… you damage the UN if the UN inspectors say he is not co‑operating, he’s in
breach, and the world does nothing about it. But I don’t believe that will happen …”

122

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

687.  Mr Blair reiterated his arguments that the world had to take a stand to disarm Iraq
so as to send a message to other countries that were potentially developing weapons
of mass destruction that they had to take the international community seriously. Delay
would make it more difficult to deal with the issue: in his view it was “only a matter of
time before international terrorism and these types of weapons come together”.
688.  Asked what was the most important item on the agenda for his meeting with
President Bush, Mr Blair replied:
“To agree the right strategy for the future and to … explain … yet again why it is
important to deal with this issue.”
689.  Mr Blair concluded in relation to Iraq that:
“… when America is taking on these tough and difficult questions our job is to be
there. Not be there at any price, not be there without saying how we think the thing
should be dealt with, but being there in the difficult and tricky times, not simply …
as fair weather friends.”
690.  Mr Scarlett and SIS1 provided material for use during the interview. This is
addressed in Section 4.3.
691.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that the UK problem was that President Bush
“seemed hell‑bent on war and we looked like we were doing things from a US not
UK perspective”.238
692.  Mr Campbell added on 27 January: “Despite yesterday people were still applying
the yardstick that the inspectors would have to find WMD rather than simply that
Saddam had to co‑operate.”239
693.  Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, told Mr Blair on 27 January that
inspections needed more time.
694.  President Putin contacted Mr Blair on 27 January to discuss the differences in
the international community’s approach to North Korea and Iraq.240 On the former, the
strategy was to pursue a negotiation, including contacts between the US and North
Korea. Mr Blair agreed to discuss that with President Bush, and that:
“We need to bind the North Koreans into an agreement that preserved their dignity
while ensuring that they could not develop their weapons.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

695.  On Iraq, President Putin’s view was that the purpose of the military build up was
to put pressure on Iraq, not a preparation for war. Russia was doing the same through
diplomatic means and had managed to ensure that the Iraqis gave permission for
scientists to go abroad to be interviewed and searches of private homes. UNMOVIC and
the IAEA had some questions, but they were procedural, there were no complaints that
Iraq was interfering with the inspections. The inspectors should be allowed to continue
their work. He trusted the inspectors and they should be given more time.
696.  Mr Blair agreed that the inspectors should have time to do their job, but it
was “crucial” that it “did not become a game of hide and seek”. Iraq had to help the
inspectors; Saddam Hussein was obliged to give them positive co‑operation, not just
access. He would discuss the issues with President Bush and then speak to President
Putin again.
697.  President Putin emphasised that it was a very important conversation and
concluded that Saddam Hussein should comply with all his obligations and the
inspectors’ requests; he must accommodate our demands. Moscow was not interested
in covering for Iraq if it had weapons or was seeking to acquire them. If Iraq had any
weapons, they must destroy them and comply with the inspectors.
698.  Mr Campbell wrote that the call was “encouraging”; President Putin was “really
losing patience with Saddam”.241
699.  In an interview before the reports to the Security Council on 27 January, Mr Igor
Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, told Al Jazeera that he strongly doubted
that the Council would authorise military action against Iraq: “the chances … are
practically nil”.242

Security Council, 27 January 2003
700.  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 27 January that Iraq appeared
to have decided in principle to co‑operate on process, but an Iraqi decision to
co‑operate on substance would be “indispensible” for the inspectors to complete
their tasks.
701.  Iraq’s declaration of 7 December did not provide new evidence which would
eliminate or reduce the unresolved issues identified in 1999.

241 

124

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

702.  In his report to the Security Council on 27 January, Dr Blix rehearsed the
disarmament process since 1991 and identified three “important questions” for the
Security Council:

•	
•	
•	

“[H]ow much [prohibited material and activity] might remain undeclared and
intact from before 1991”?
“[W]hat, if anything, was illegally produced or procured after 1998, when the
inspectors left”?
How to prevent “any weapons of mass destruction be[ing] produced or procured
in the future”?243

703.  Dr Blix reported on UNMOVIC’s activities and gave an assessment of the extent
of Iraq’s co‑operation with those activities, including its declaration of 7 December 2002.
704.  Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC shared “the sense of urgency felt by the [Security]
Council to use inspection as a path to attain, within a reasonable time verifiable
disarmament of Iraq”. UNMOVIC’s capability was “growing”. It had 260 staff members
of whom 100 were inspectors. It had conducted about 300 inspections at more than
230 sites, of which 20 were sites which had not been inspected before. A training
programme in Vienna would create a pool of 350 qualified experts from which inspectors
could be drawn.
705.  Dr Blix reported: “It would appear from our experience so far that Iraq has decided
in principle to provide co‑operation on process, namely access.” Iraq had “on the whole
co‑operated rather well so far … access has been provided to all sites that we wanted
to inspect and with one exception it has been prompt”. There had, however, been “some
problems” in two areas: Iraq’s refusal to guarantee the safety of U2 flights to provide
aerial imagery and for surveillance during inspections; and helicopter operations,
although that had been “solved”. There had also been “some recent disturbing incidents
and harassment”.
706.  Dr Blix stated that an Iraqi decision to provide co‑operation on substance was
“indispensible” to bring “the disarmament task to completion”. OP9 of resolution 1441
required Iraqi co‑operation to be “active”. It was “not enough to open doors”. Inspection
was “not a game of ‘catch as catch can’. Rather … it is a process of verification for the
purpose of creating confidence.”
707.  Dr Blix reported: “In the fields of missiles and biotechnology, Iraq’s declaration
contains a good deal of new material and information covering the period from 1998
and onward. This is welcome.”

UN Press Release, 27 January 2003, Security Council briefed by Chief UN Weapons Experts on First
60 days of Inspections in Iraq (SC/7644).
243 

125

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

708.  But Dr Blix stated:
“One might have expected … that Iraq might have tried to respond to, clarify and
submit supporting evidence regarding the many open disarmament issues, which
the Iraqi side should be familiar with from the UNSCOM document S/1999/94 of
January 1999 and the so‑called Amorim Report of March 1999 … These are the
questions which UNMOVIC, governments and independent commentators have
often cited.”
709.  UNMOVIC had found “the issues listed in those two documents as unresolved,
professionally justified”. The reports pointed to:
“… lack of evidence and inconsistencies … which must be straightened out, if
weapons dossiers are to be closed … They deserve to be taken seriously by Iraq
rather than being brushed aside as evil machinations of UNSCOM. Regrettably,
the … declaration, most of which is a reprint of earlier documents, does not
seem to contain any new evidence that would eliminate the questions or reduce
their number.”
710.  Dr Blix set out examples of questions and issues that needed to be addressed
in some detail, including:

•	

•	

•	

•	

UNMOVIC had information indicating that Iraq had worked on purifying and
stabilising the nerve agent VX, and had achieved more than it had declared.
This conflicted with the Iraqi account that the agent had only been produced
on a pilot scale, had been destroyed in 1991, and was never weaponised. There
were also questions to be answered about the fate of VX precursor chemicals.
Iraq had provided a copy of the “Air Force” document it had withheld in 1998.
It indicated that 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force
between 1983 and 1988. Iraq had claimed that 19,500 bombs were consumed
during that period. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, UNMOVIC “must
assume these quantities are now unaccounted for”.
The discovery of “a number of 122mm chemical rocket warheads in a bunker at
a storage depot southwest of Baghdad”. The bunker was relatively new, which
meant “the rockets must have been moved there in the past few years, at a time
when Iraq should not have had such munitions”. Iraq had stated that they were
“overlooked from 1991 from a batch of 2,000 that were stored there during the
Gulf War. That could be the case. They could also be the tip of a submerged
iceberg. The discovery of a few rockets does not resolve, but rather points to,
the issue of several thousands of chemical rockets that are unaccounted for.”
Iraq had subsequently found four more chemical rockets at a storage depot in
al‑Taji. The warheads were “empty”.
Inspectors had found “a laboratory quantity of thiodiglycal, a mustard
gas precursor”.

There were “strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared,
and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date.
It might still exist.”
Iraq had not declared “a significant quantity of bacterial growth media” which had
been included in Iraq’s submission to the Amorim panel. This omission appeared
“to be deliberate as the pages of the resubmitted document were renumbered”.
The quantity of growth media involved would “suffice to produce … about
5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax”.
The Al Samoud 2 and Al Fatah missiles “might well represent prima facie cases
of proscribed systems” but further technical consideration would be necessary
before reaching a conclusion on the issue.
Iraq had refurbished its missile production infrastructure, including a number
of casting chambers which were capable of producing motors for missiles with
ranges greater than the 150km limit.
Iraq had illegally imported 300 rocket engines which might be for the
Al Samoud 2, chemicals used in propellants and other potentially
proscribed items.

711.  Dr Blix questioned Iraq’s claims that there were no more documents about its
activities. After the discovery of documents in the home of a scientist “relating to the
laser enrichment of uranium”, UNMOVIC could not “help but think that the case might
not be isolated and that such placements of documents is deliberate to make discovery
difficult”. He warned that: “Any further sign of the concealment of documents would
be serious.”
712.  Dr Blix also questioned whether Iraq had provided a complete list of the names of
personnel who had worked on proscribed programmes, and pointed out the difficulties of
interviewing individuals “in private”. He reported that UNMOVIC had asked 11 individuals
for interview in Baghdad and that none of them would speak without the presence of an
Iraqi official.
713.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence that Iraq had
revived its nuclear weapons programme but it was still investigating a number
of issues and Iraq needed to shift from passive to pro‑active support.
714.  Dr ElBaradei called for a few months to verify Iraq’s nuclear disarmament
and to demonstrate that the inspection process worked as a central feature of
the international nuclear arms control regime.
715.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had conducted 139 inspections at some
106 locations, with a “focus on areas of concern identified by other States, facilities
identified through satellite imagery as having been modified or constructed since 1998,
and other inspection leads identified independently”.244 They had been able to “gain

ready access and to clarify the nature of the activities” at those facilities. “No prohibited
nuclear activities” had been identified.
716.  Dr ElBaradei described the Iraqi declaration as “consistent with our understanding
of Iraq’s pre‑1991 nuclear programme”. Iraq had not provided “any new information
relevant to … questions which had been outstanding since 1998”. While those questions
did “not constitute unresolved disarmament issues”, further clarification was needed.
717.  The IAEA had been conducting “exhaustive analysis of supporting information”.
Dr ElBaradei also reported difficulties in securing private interviews with the three
individuals the IAEA had approached.
718.  Iraq’s unsuccessful attempts to procure high‑strength aluminium tubes which
Iraq had indicated were related to a programme to reverse engineer conventional
rockets, had been a particular focus. The IAEA had concluded that the tubes “would be
consistent with” use in a conventional rocket programme. They “would not be suitable
for manufacturing centrifuges” without modification. The IAEA was “still investigating” the
issue, but the attempt to acquire such tubes was “prohibited” by resolution 687 (1991).
719.  The IAEA was investigating how “dual‑use” material had been relocated or used,
including the “HMX” high explosive which had been removed from IAEA seals at the end
of 1998. Dr ElBaradei stated that it would be difficult to verify how that had been used.
720.  The IAEA was investigating reports of Iraqi efforts to import uranium but it did
“not have enough information, and … would appreciate more”.
721.  Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA had “begun in the last few weeks to receive
more actionable information from States”, and he called on those that “had access to
such information to provide it … so that the inspection process can be accelerated and
additional assurances generated”.
722.  Dr ElBaradei emphasised the need for Iraq to “shift from passive support … to
pro‑active support”. He cited as an example the retrieval of documents relating, “in
part, to Iraq’s pre‑1991 efforts to use laser technology for enriching uranium”. It was
“urgent and essential” for Iraq “on its own initiative, to identify and provide any additional
evidence that would assist the inspectors in carrying out their mandate”.
723.  Dr ElBaradei warned that there was:
“… a window of opportunity that may not remain open for very much longer. Iraq
should make every effort to be fully transparent … The international community will
not be satisfied when questions remain open … the world is asking for a high level
of assurance that Iraq is completely free from all such weapons, and is already
impatient to receive it.”

724.  Dr ElBaradei stated that the presence of international inspectors in Iraq “continues
to serve as an effective deterrent to and insurance against resumption of programmes
to develop weapons of mass destruction, even as we continue to look for possible
past activities”.
725.  Dr ElBaradei concluded:
“… we have to date found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons
programme since the elimination of the programme in the 1990s … [O]ur work is
steadily progressing and should be allowed to run its natural course … [W]e should
be able within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no
nuclear weapons programme. These few months … would be a valuable investment
in peace because they could help us avoid a war. We trust that we will continue
to have the support of the Council … to verify Iraq’s nuclear disarmament through
peaceful means and to demonstrate that the inspection process can and does work
as a central feature of the international nuclear arms control regime.”
726.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in subsequent informal consultations of the
Council, there was general scepticism that Iraq had “co‑operated adequately”, but also
a desire for more time.245
727.  Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte had delivered a pre‑prepared
statement saying that there was nothing in either Dr Blix or Dr ElBaradei’s reports which
gave hope that Iraq ever intended to comply with resolution 1441 and that the time was
fast approaching when the Security Council would have to demonstrate it meant what it
had said.
728.  Sir Jeremy stated that the Council had heard “a catalogue of unresolved
questions”. The “onus was on Iraq to prove the zero it had declared” and to provide
“substantive evidence”. Iraqi co‑operation had been “limited and grudging” and
looked like “a carefully considered policy of withholding information and obstruction”.
UNMOVIC and the IAEA needed to conduct more intrusive inspections and “carry out
more productive interviews to unravel the facts”.
729.  At a later meeting, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had provided answers to specific
points raised in the informal discussion, including:

•	
•	

Dr Blix had complained about the number of Iraqi minders for inspections.

•	

Dr Blix felt that there was a determination at a high level to co‑operate on
process but “on substance, Iraq simply said the outstanding questions were
nonsensical”. Unless that changed, he was “not optimistic of solutions”.

There had been demonstrations during inspections but UNMOVIC had not
been intimidated.

Dr Blix said that interviews with minders were not “without value”, but “a long
pattern of refusals to attend private interviews would be hard to interpret as
anything other than intimidation”.
Denial of access to a private house would be a serious matter.
Dr ElBaradei said that the documents found at a private home “looked like a
scientist’s personal collection of papers over 30 years”. They had “not added
to IAEA knowledge and it was impossible to judge whether this was an example
of hidden documents”.
The IAEA had no authority to force people to give interviews.

730.  Sir Jeremy commented that the day had been important and a good foundation
for “a harder debate on 29 January”. He concluded:
“If we play this carefully, and can win a bit more time, we might be able to construct
a bit more of an edifice.”
731.  In a press statement on 28 January, Mr Straw published “a list of 10 key questions”
from Dr Blix’s report.246 Mr Straw also stated:
“The conclusion is now inescapable that Iraq is in material breach of resolution 1441.
We want to see the matter resolved … by peaceful means … The regime does not
have long to change its behaviour fundamentally. We cannot let Saddam Hussein
and the Iraqi regime get away with never-ending deceit and delay.”
732.  Russia emphasised the need for political efforts through the Security Council
to disarm Iraq.
733.  In a press conference in New York after the meeting, Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian
Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that Russia believed the inspections were
“going well” and a spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow
stated: “only inspections can give an answer to the international community’s question
about whether Iraq has weapons of mass destruction”.247 Mr Igor Ivanov told US NBC
that Russian diplomats would try to find a solution which would preserve the Security
Council’s unity.
734.  Sir Roderic Lyne, British Ambassador to Russia, reported that all Russian officials
were playing down the significance of the reports to the Security Council, “emphasising
that they were only preliminary findings”. Russia was keeping its options open on future
handling of the issue “while calling for the inspections to continue”.

735.  During a visit to Kiev on 28 January, President Putin stated that international
security was “a more important issue than Iraq” and that any steps on the Iraqi problem
must be taken through the Security Council. Iraq was co‑operating so far but:
“… if Iraq begins to create problems for the inspectors, Russia can change its
position and reach an agreement with the US on developing different, tougher
decisions in the Security Council.”248
736.  In a separate statement, Mr Igor Ivanov stressed that inspections must continue,
but that Iraq must co‑operate actively, giving the inspectors “every possible assistance”.
There were “a lot of unclear questions” remaining about chemical and biological
weapons. He criticised Iraqi officials who had stated that Iraq might attack Kuwait
in the event of a war. That did not promote “the necessary conditions for continuing
political efforts to settle the Iraq situation”. Russia was firmly opposed to military action
both against Iraq and from its territory. Unilateral action against Iraq would split the
anti‑terrorist coalition. Russia would direct its efforts to “thinking how to avoid a veto” and
finding a solution that would preserve the important unity of the Security Council. If Iraq
committed “flagrant violations” of resolution 1441, the Security Council should consider
“the possibility of additional steps” to meet the requirements of the resolution.
737.  Sir Roderic Lyne commented that the two statements “seemed to mark a shift
in Russian rhetoric on Iraq”.

President Bush’s State of the Union address, 28 January 2003
738.  In his State of the Union address on 28 January, President Bush set out his
view that Iraq’s actions demonstrated it had decided not to take the final chance
to disarm. Saddam Hussein had shown “utter contempt” for that offer; he was
deceiving the international community, not disarming. The US would not wait
to act until the threat from Iraq was imminent.
739.  President Bush announced that the US had asked for a meeting of
the Security Council on 5 February at which Secretary Powell would present
information and intelligence on Iraq’s illegal programmes.
740.  In his “State of the Union” address on 28 January, President Bush emphasised the
threat of terrorism to the US and others, the potential threat from Iraq in that context, and
the need to disarm Iraq.249
741.  President Bush’s detailed statements about the threat posed by Iraq are set out
in the Box below.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Extracts from President Bush’s State of the Union address,
28 January 2003
President Bush stated:
“Today, the gravest danger in the war on terror, the gravest danger facing America
and the world, is outlawed regimes that seek and possess nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons. These regimes could use such weapons for blackmail, terror,
and mass murder. They could also give or sell those weapons to terrorist allies, who
would use them without the least hesitation.
“This threat is new; America’s duty is familiar …
“America is making a broad and determined effort to confront these dangers …
“Different threats require different strategies …
“Our nation and the world must learn the lessons of the Korean peninsula and
not allow an even greater threat to rise up in Iraq. A brutal dictator with a history
of reckless aggression, with ties to terrorism, with great potential wealth, will not
be permitted to dominate a vital region and threaten the United States.
“Twelve years ago, Saddam Hussein … agreed to disarm … For the next 12 years,
he systematically violated that agreement. He pursued chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons … Nothing to date has restrained him from his pursuit of these
weapons – not economic sanctions, not isolation from the civilized world, not even
cruise missiles strikes on his military facilities.
“… the United Nations Security Council gave Saddam Hussein his final chance to
disarm. He has shown instead utter contempt … The … UN inspectors … were not
sent to conduct a scavenger hunt for hidden materials … The job of the inspectors
is to verify that Iraq’s regime is disarming. It is up to Iraq to show exactly where it is
hiding his banned weapons, lay those weapons out for the world to see, and destroy
them as directed. Nothing like this has happened.
“The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons
sufficient to produce over 25,000 litres of anthrax – enough doses to kill several
million people. He hasn’t accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that
he has destroyed it.
“The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had material sufficient to
produce more than 38,000 litres of botulinum toxin …
“Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce
as much as 500 tonnes of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent …
“US intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions
capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them –
despite Iraq’s recent declaration denying their existence …
“From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile
biological weapons labs …

132

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

“The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam
Hussein had an advanced nuclear weapons development program … The British
Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities
of uranium from Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to
purchase high‑strength aluminium tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production.
Saddam Hussein has not credibly explained these activities. He clearly has
much to hide.
“The dictator of Iraq is not disarming. To the contrary; he is deceiving. From
intelligence sources we know, for instance, that thousands of Iraqi security personnel
are at work hiding documents and materials from the UN inspectors, sanitising
inspection sites and monitoring the inspectors themselves. Iraqi officials accompany
inspectors in order to intimidate witnesses.
“Iraq is blocking U2 surveillance flights … Iraqi intelligence officers are posing as the
scientists inspectors are supposed to interview. Real scientists have been coached
by Iraqi officials on what to say. Intelligence sources indicate that Saddam Hussein
has ordered scientists who co‑operate with UN inspectors … will be killed, along with
their families.
“Year after year, Saddam has gone to elaborate lengths, spent enormous sums,
taken great risks to build and keep weapons of mass destruction … The only possible
explanation, the only possible use … is to dominate, intimidate or attack.
“With nuclear arms or a full arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, Saddam
Hussein could resume his ambitions of conquest in the Middle East and create deadly
havoc in that region. And this Congress and the America[n] people must recognise
another threat. Evidence from intelligence sources, secret communications, and
statements by people now in custody reveal that Saddam Hussein aids and protects
terrorists, including members of Al Qaida. Secretly, and without fingerprints, he could
provide one of his hidden weapons to terrorists, or help them develop their own.
“Before September the 11th, many in the world believed that Saddam Hussein could
be contained. But chemical agents, lethal viruses and shadowy terrorist networks are
not easily contained. Imagine those 19 hijackers … armed by Saddam Hussein …
“Some have said we must not act until the threat is imminent … If this threat is
permitted to fully and suddenly emerge, all actions or words, or recriminations
would come too late. Trusting in the sanity and restraint of Saddam Hussein is
not a strategy, and it is not an option.
“The dictator who is assembling the world’s most dangerous weapons has already
used them … International human rights groups have catalogued other methods used
in the torture chambers of Iraq …
“… tonight I have a message for the brave and oppressed people of Iraq: your enemy
is not surrounding your country – your enemy is ruling your country. And the day he
and his regime are removed from power will be the day of your liberation.
“The world has waited 12 years for Iraq to disarm. America will not accept a serious
and mounting threat to our country …

133

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“We will consult. But let there be no misunderstanding: if Saddam Hussein does not
fully disarm, for the safety of our people and for the peace of the world, we will lead
a coalition to disarm him.”

742.  President Bush also announced that the US would ask the UN Security Council
to convene on 5 February to “consider the facts of Iraq’s ongoing defiance”; and that
Secretary Powell would “present information and intelligence about Iraq’s … illegal
weapons programs, its attempt to hide those weapons from inspectors, and its links
to terrorist groups”.

Security Council, 29 January 2003
743.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock continued to advise that there was little support
in the Security Council for a second resolution.
744.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that only four countries definitely supported a
second resolution and that:
“Things will not move in our direction without some fact or development to give
countries the grounds on which to change position, or at least give us more time
to … confirm the conclusion that Iraq will not co‑operate.”250
745.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Security Council on 29 January that Iraq
was in material breach of resolution 1441 and the Council could not “simply tread
water”. It would have to “take tough decisions soon”.
746.  On 29 January, the Security Council met for a second time to discuss the reports
delivered by Dr Blix and Dr Elbaradei on 27 January.251
747.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the discussion was “a replay of earlier
positions”, and that “Almost every delegation” had welcomed Secretary Powell’s
intention to “provide evidence” on 5 February. Most delegations saw the presentation as
“feeding in to the inspections process”.
748.  Sir Jeremy told the Council that, in asking for more time, there was a need to
be realistic: “Time would not achieve anything without the co‑operation we expected.”
Iraq had: not given “access to its illegal WMD programmes”; “allowed omissions in the
declaration”; and “failed to co‑operate”. “The inescapable conclusion was Iraq was in
material breach of [resolution] 1441.”

749.  Sir Jeremy said that he was sure others shared the frustration that Iraq was not
taking the final opportunity. It was “still not too late – but Iraq had to co‑operate now.
If it did not, there was no way the inspectors would be able to fulfil their mandate.”
750.  Sir Jeremy asked a series of questions about how, if the difficulties experienced
were a reflection of planned Iraqi resistance, more time would resolve the issues.
He added that the Council:
“… had to realise that it was up against a serious decision under a tight
timescale. More time would not help … [W]e had to stay together in insisting the
non‑compliance had to stop or the Council would no longer be in charge of this
process through inspections …”
751.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had hammered home that the Council could not
“simply tread water” and would have to “take tough decisions soon”.

Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, 31 January 2003
The US position
752.  Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove reiterated the UK’s concerns
in talks in Washington on 29 January, including a request to delay military action
until the end of March.
753.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that he thought the US accepted that
a second resolution would be needed, but there was no “agreement to wait until
the end of March”.
754.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that President Bush would be “pretty
implacable” and “impatient”, and that he was convinced that the critics
of military action would be routed by an early and easy military victory.
755.  Reflecting previous difficulties, Sir David Manning and Sir Christopher
Meyer both advised Mr Blair that he would need to spell out his message to
President Bush in a way which left no scope for “interpretation” in Washington.
756.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on 27 January about the UK’s need for
Parliamentary support for military action; and that the only way to get that support
would be a second resolution.252 That would need a delay until the end of March.
757.  Sir David did not get the response he had wished. He advised Mr Blair that
he would need to speak to President Bush again before their meeting in the US
on 31 January.

252

135

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

758.  Sir David Manning visited Washington on 29 January for talks with Dr Rice.253
He was accompanied by Sir Richard Dearlove.
759.  Sir David Manning reiterated many of the points he had made in previous
conversations with Dr Rice.
760.  Sir David reported that he had informed Dr Rice that, without a second resolution,
Mr Blair would not be able to secure Cabinet and Parliamentary support for military
action; and that he could be forced from office if he tried: “The US must not promote
regime change in Baghdad at the price of regime change in London.” Mr Blair was not
asking for much time: “weeks not months” and action beginning at the end of March.
761.  Sir David reported that the UK was significantly less optimistic than the US about
the current level of support for a second resolution authorising military action and the
prospects for increasing that support. The UK was anxious not to give the impression
that inspections were running out of time; that was needed for more reports from Dr Blix
which would carry much more weight internationally than the US and UK view. Mr Blair
was in a very different position from President Bush, who already had Congressional
authority to act.
762.  Sir Richard Dearlove had “briefed in detail on our intelligence” which the
US Administration “clearly find very impressive”.
763.  Sir David had “spelt out the political realities about Iraq extremely bluntly”.
He thought that the US had accepted a second resolution would be needed but there
was no agreement to wait until the end of March. Mr Blair would need to “stick very
strongly to the arguments in your Note” and to “spell them out in a way that leaves no
scope for … ‘interpretation’”. A late March date would mean a pretty intensive timetable.
He suggested that one possibility would be to review the position again after Dr Blix’s
next report in mid‑February.
764.  The minute was sent only to addressees inside No.10 with a private and personal
copy sent to Mr Straw.
765.  Reporting on the mood in Washington for Mr Blair’s visit, Sir Christopher Meyer
advised:
“It is politically impossible for Bush to back down from going to war in Iraq this
spring, absent Saddam’s surrender or disappearance from the scene. If Bush
had any room for manoeuvre beforehand, this was closed off by his State of the
Union speech …

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

“… Bush … said in effect that destroying Saddam is a crusade against evil
to be undertaken by God’s chosen nation: ‘this call of history has come to the
right people’.
“The target of Bush’s messianic appeal was … the anxious and unconvinced in
the country at large … The call to rally to the flag, the President and to the military
should, on past precedent, evoke an emotional and positive response …
“… The novel element was the promise that Powell would produce fresh evidence
of collaboration between Saddam and Al Qaida. For the White House, the key
to the questions ‘Why Iraq, why now?’ has always been the rogue state/WMD/
terrorism nexus: not as a worrying possibility in future years, but as a clear and
present danger.
“… if Powell goes off at half‑cock, it will only reinforce, as Jeremy Greenstock has
underlined already, the view that the US is hell‑bent on war and short‑circuiting
SCR 1441.
“The Prime Minister will find on Friday a pretty implacable Bush: impatient, deeply
disillusioned with France and Germany, convinced that his – and Mr Blair’s – critics
will be routed by an early and easy military victory. He is very much influenced by …
[the fact] that in the past the US has failed to respond forcibly to multiple provocation
and attacks to the detriment of its reputation and standing. This time the US could
not back off.
“Unless we have some good ideas for sending Saddam into exile, Mr Blair’s task on
Friday will be to ensure that we and the US go to war in the best company possible.
That means securing the time to assemble the largest possible coalition both for the
war itself and for the aftermath. If the notorious smoking gun can be found, this will
make things much easier …
“Bush does not look to have the patience to let Blix make the case. I said in an
earlier report that exhausting the UN route was likely to mean different things in
Washington and London. Bush is undecided about a second resolution: whether
it will be worth going for and, if it is, what should be put in it. In other words – as
of this morning – Bush has not yet bought into the strategy which the Prime Minister
put to him last week.”254
766.  Reflecting the difficulties which had arisen from ambiguity about the messages
Mr Blair had given President Bush during their meeting at Camp David in early
September 2002, Sir Christopher concluded:
“There are huge expectations here of Friday’s meeting and the press are watching
like vultures for splits. The Prime Minister will obviously want to reach full agreement

with the President on the way ahead in the next few weeks. Unless something
changes in the next 48 hours, that will require pressing back very forcefully to secure
our interest, on another resolution and timelines. The subsequent agreement will
have to be clear beyond doubt in its particulars. After the last Camp David meeting,
the hawks immediately started to distort the outcome to their own ends.”

Other views
767.  Mr Blair decided to canvass the views of his European colleagues and other
allies in advance of the meeting with President Bush on 31 January.
768.  A joint statement issued by the UK and seven other European nations
on 30 January stated that the international community should remain united
in calling for the disarmament of Iraq and that the Security Council should
face up to its responsibilities.
769.  The leaders of eight European nations – Spain, Portugal, Italy, the UK, the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Denmark – produced a joint article published
on 30 January arguing that Europe and the USA must stand united.255
770.  The statement set out the importance of the relationship between Europe and
America and argued that:
“The transatlantic relationship must not become a casualty of the current Iraqi
regime’s persistent attempts to threaten world security …
“… success in the … battle against terrorism and the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction demands unwavering determination and firm international
cohesion on the part of all countries for whom freedom is precious.
“The Iraqi regime and its weapons of mass destruction represent a clear threat
to world security.”
771.  The adoption of resolution 1441 had:
“… sent a clear, firm and unequivocal message that we would rid the world of the
danger posed by Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction.
“We must remain united in insisting that his regime is disarmed.
“The solidarity, cohesion and determination of the international community are our
best hope of achieving this peacefully. Our strength lies in unity.
“The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism is a threat of
incalculable consequences.

“It is one at which all of us should feel concerned. Resolution 1441 is
Saddam Hussein’s last chance to disarm using a peaceful means …
“Sadly this week the UN weapons inspectors have confirmed that his
long‑established pattern of deception, denial and non‑compliance with
UN Security Council resolutions is continuing …
“The United Nations Charter charges the Security Council with the task of preserving
international peace and security.
“To do so the Security Council must maintain its credibility by ensuring full
compliance with its resolutions.
“We cannot allow a dictator to systematically violate those resolutions. If they are not
complied with, the Security Council will lose its credibility and world peace will suffer
as a result.
“We are confident that the Security Council will face up to its responsibilities.”
772.  Mr Blair decided to speak to a number of his colleagues to establish their views,
particularly about the circumstances in which they would support military action, before
his meeting with President Bush.256 Mr Blair also planned to speak to them again after
the visit.
773.  Sir Stephen Wall, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on European Issues, was also
asked to speak to a number of his European counterparts.257
774.  Mr Blair and Mr John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, discussed the
position on Iraq on 28 January. Mr Blair said that, militarily, it might “be preferable
to proceed quickly”, but it “would be politically easier with a UN resolution”. He:
“… intended to tell President Bush that the UN track was working. Blix had said …
that Saddam was not co‑operating. If he repeated this in reports on 14 February, and
perhaps in early March there would be a strong pattern on non‑co‑operation and a
good chance of a second resolution.”258
775.  Mr Blair and Mr Howard agreed that a second resolution would be “enormously
helpful”. It would be better to try and fail than not to try at all for a second resolution but
they should “pencil in a deadline beyond which, even without a second resolution, we
should take a decision”. Mr Blair said that his instinct was that “in the end, France would
come on board, as would Russia and China”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

776.  President Chirac told Mr Blair that he would not support war unless
Saddam Hussein did something unacceptable.
777.  In a conversation later on 28 January, President Chirac told Mr Blair that the
French position had not changed; they were “against war, unless Saddam did something
unacceptable”.259 Although Dr Blix had reported that Iraq was not co‑operating,
Dr ElBaradei had reported good co‑operation. War was “always the worst outcome”.
Iraq had very little WMD compared with North Korea. The desire to preserve the
transatlantic link had to be balanced against the costs of a war.
778.  Mr Blair and President Chirac agreed that the inspectors should be given more
time. President Chirac thought that the inspectors would find nothing; Mr Blair said it
would be “serious if the inspectors continued to report insufficient co‑operation, e.g. if
the Iraqis refused interviews or denied proper access”. They agreed that, “in that case,
a second resolution would come into play”.
779.  President Chirac welcomed Mr Blair’s offer to speak again after his meeting with
President Bush.
780.  Mr Rycroft commented that President Chirac appeared:
“… to be positioning himself to support a second resolution if the inspectors find
WMD or are denied access. But his straight ‘non’ to the Prime Minster’s question
about continued Iraqi non‑co‑operation shows the problem we shall have with the
French if we are in the scenario of arguing that a pattern of non‑co‑operation is a
material breach of 1441.”
781.  A minute from Sir David Manning to Mr Blair records that President Chirac had
refused to accept a phone call from Mr Blair for the preceding two weeks.260
782.  Mr de Villepin spoke twice to Mr Straw on 29 January.
783.  In the first conversation, Mr de Villepin questioned why military action should
be used against Iraq when 20‑30 other countries had chemical weapons. It was
hard to explain the threat posed by Iraq when there was almost no risk from the
nuclear programme.261
784.  Mr Straw’s response focused on the process in resolution 1441 agreed by the
UK and France. In his view, there were “two key questions”:
“… was there a material breach and what action should the international community
take. Blix’s report had shown that Iraq was in material breach according to the
Letter Rycroft to Sinclair, 28 January 2003, ‘Iraq: Prime Minister’s Conversation with Chirac,
28 January’.

definition set out in OP4. There had been plenty of material breaches in the past
which had not led to military action. But, as UNSCR 1441 set out, if there were a
further material breach then Iraq would face serious consequences. This could only
mean military action.”
785.  Mr de Villepin responded that, as politicians, he and Mr Straw had to show how
military action corresponded to the threat. The issue of material breach had to be faced.
786.  Mr Straw countered that “just because the international community was not taking
action against other states was not an argument for inaction against Iraq”; and taking
action against Iraq “would be a deterrent to other countries”. In his view it would be
“possible to avoid military action only if the international community remained united
in telling Iraq to comply”.
787.  In the second conversation, Mr de Villepin expressed surprise about the joint
article signed by eight European Prime Ministers which Mr Blair had not mentioned
to President Chirac.262
788.  Mr Straw told Mr de Villepin that at the time resolution 1441 was agreed, “everyone
knew that a further material breach would trigger a meeting of the Security Council”.
Mr de Villepin did not agree with Mr Straw’s view that Iraq “had committed a further
material breach”. Mr Straw argued that resolution 1441 had:
“… agreed a 60‑day inspection period. Blix had then reported. There would be
further discussions in the Security Council. If Iraq changed its behaviour, then good.
If not, military action would become inevitable …”
789.  Mr de Villepin had stated that France would never be placed in a position where
it would agree to a second resolution simply as window dressing for military action; it
wanted time to allow the build‑up of pressure to work. The US timeframe was too short.
790.  Mr Straw said:
“… the more the inspectors found a pattern of non‑compliance, the greater the
suspicion surrounding Saddam’s WMD …
“It would be terrible if, in the case of a clear further material breach, the international
community did nothing. It was in no one’s interest to see the US act unilaterally.
That would mean the international community losing influence over US actions.”
791.  When Mr Straw asked whether France would consider using its veto, Mr de Villepin
“ducked the question”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

792.  Sir Roderic Lyne advised that Russia would vote in favour of a second
resolution in response to a “smoking gun”; but that it might support or abstain
on a resolution based on reports of non‑co‑operation.
793.  In a telegram on 30 January, Sir Roderic Lyne advised that Russia was “not
nearly as steamed up about Iraq” as France and Germany.263 President Putin’s
attitude was “based on a pragmatic assessment of Russia’s interests – which means
avoiding war if possible, but more importantly not falling out with the Americans and
avoiding marginalisation at the UN”. Russia was “not talking veto language” and
President Putin’s remarks were beginning “to prepare public opinion for a vote in favour
[of a second resolution]”.
794.  Sir Roderic wrote that Russia was “in the ‘most opposed’ group in the Security
Council” but Moscow was “not signalling real determination to make difficulties or hold
out to the end – rather the opposite”. The mood was “a mixture of pragmatism and sullen
acquiescence in a presumed outcome”.
795.  The evidence for those conclusions set out by Sir Roderic included:

•	

•	
•

263 

The official Russian line before the reports to the Security Council, about the
need for more time and that military action would not be justified, was “ritualistic,
carefully moderated and designed not to box Russia in (nor to whip up public
emotions)”. President Putin’s remarks in Kiev had “changed the tune sharply”.
Mr Igor Ivanov had “swung into line”.
President Putin had told Mr Blair “two years ago that he would not regret
the passing of Saddam Hussein”, and he had not “pressed hard” since
resolution 1441.
“THE FRANCO‑RUSSIAN SYMPHONY” wasn’t playing: “Before 1441, Chirac
and Villepin were burning up the phone lines to Moscow, and Lavrov and Levitte
[Mr Jean‑David Levitte, French Permanent Representative to the UN] were (for
a while) in bed together in New York. It feels different this time.” That was partly
because “the Russians thought the French welshed on them in the 1441 end
game”. The larger point was that President Putin knew that Iraq was the “litmus
test” for his strategic relationship with President Bush. President Putin’s visit
to France and Germany from 9‑11 February might “well create the impression
of a common front, but under the surface it isn’t so”.
“Almost no one” in Russia wanted to see a war in Iraq. The “Russian body
politic” was “acutely uncomfortable with US hyperpower and Russian impotence”
but there was “less heat” about Iraq than “in France, Germany or Western
Europe in general”. No one was forecasting that President Putin would “break
with the Americans”.

“Keeping the oil price high (though not extreme) and avoiding a post‑conflict
collapse” was a key Russian interest.
Russia was “not trying any” political initiatives. It seemed to have “put some
pressure” on Iraq, but relations were “not warm”.

796.  Sir Roderic advised that Russia would:
“… tuck in behind the French and Germans in the Security Council, with the
Chinese, but not lead the pack. They’ll support more time for inspections, calls
for proof positive, and ploys to get Saddam to concede or step down.
“They will not veto in isolation; probably not veto in Chinese company alone; and in
general will do all they can to avoid vetoing. They would rather let through (perhaps
on abstention) a distasteful second UNSCR than see the Americans go unilaterally
and sideline the Security Council. They would vote in favour of a ‘smoking gun’
resolution and in favour or abstain (depending on the French vote) on a resolution
based on reports from Blix of non‑co‑operation.
“… It would be awkward but not completely impossible for Putin domestically
to be more US‑friendly in a vote than … [Germany or France].
“… If the US goes unilateral, the Russians will make a decent show of grumbling …
but they won’t be actively obstructive.”
797.  Sir Roderic concluded that the UK approach should be: “More of the same.”
The UK “should help the Americans to keep the Russians engaged, including on
day after issues”. This meant continuing conversations with Russians, including with
President Putin and Mr Igor Ivanov. The “bottom line” was that President Putin would
not want:
“… to lose the chips he’s staked on Bush. Iraq versus the USA is a no brainer.
(Nor does Putin wish to part company with us, in the run‑up to his State Visit.)”
798.  Mr Straw told Mr Igor Ivanov that the question of a material breach was
for the Security Council or individual members. He accepted that resolution 1441
had not set a timetable for inspections.
799.  The record of Mr Igor Ivanov’s telephone call to Mr Straw on the afternoon of
30 January reported that Mr Ivanov had said it was necessary to address the problems
identified in Dr Blix’s report, but he saw no problems which could not be resolved
by negotiations.264

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

800.  Mr Straw agreed that most problems in Dr Blix’s report:
“… could be resolved if Iraq complied. But there could be no doubt that Iraq was
in further material breach because of its non‑compliance. It was important that
Iraq got the message that time had almost run out. It would be stupid of them not
to co‑operate now.”
801.  Questioning Mr Straw’s statement, Mr Ivanov said: “it was up to the inspectors
to say how much time they needed to complete their mission. If they needed five to six
months, who were we to say they should not get it.”
802.  Mr Straw “accepted” that there was nothing in resolution 1441 on the timing. That
was: “a matter for the Security Council. But Iraq should have complied over the past two
months, or even in the 1990s.”
803.  Mr Ivanov agreed that:
“… it was for the Security Council to decide on timing … [T]he previous inspectors
had worked for eight years and done a great job. ElBaradei had told … [him] that he
needed two more months. Blix needed more time too. The Security Council could
give the inspectors time to finish their job.
“… the Blix report had said nothing about a material breach.”
804.  Mr Straw said:
“… material breach was not a matter for the inspectors, but for the Security Council
or for individual members. If one looked at OP4 … it was very hard to see how Iraq
was not now in further material breach.”
805.  Mr Ivanov agreed that:
“… it was for the Security Council to decide if there were a further material breach.
But, looking at the Blix and ElBaradei reports, Russia saw no reason to declare
that Iraq was in material breach. But there was a definite need to seek further
co‑operation from Iraq.”

JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003
806.  The JIC assessed on 29 January that retaining WMD was a vital Iraqi
interest and that Saddam Hussein was unlikely to agree to relinquish power
or go into exile.
807.  The JIC predicted that, once military action began, widespread lack of loyalty
to the regime would become clear and a hard‑fought professional defence of
Baghdad was “unlikely”.

144

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

808.  The JIC sustained its earlier judgements on Iraq’s ability and intent to
conduct terrorist operations.
809.  At the request of the FCO, the JIC reviewed current developments in Iraq from
Saddam Hussein’s perspective and possible Iraqi moves in the coming weeks.265
810.  The minutes of the JIC discussion on 29 January record that the draft Assessment
had been difficult to write given the fast‑moving developments and it was important to
ensure it reflected the latest information, especially the UNMOVIC perspective.266 They
also recorded that:
“… it was difficult to predict if and when Saddam might launch pre‑emptive strikes,
but the paper should try and make a judgement on possible timescales. The trigger
would probably be set when Saddam concluded that his fate was sealed, rather
than any movements by Coalition Forces. Most of the Iraqi military would probably
crumble quickly under attack. Saddam would maintain his hold on of power until
then, and there were no indications of possible coups beforehand. Whilst the Iraqi
public might welcome the end of Saddam’s regime, they were also concerned about
the human costs of fighting.”
811.  The key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.

JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003:
‘Iraq: The Emerging View from Baghdad’
Key Judgements

265 
266 

•	

“Retaining WMD remains a vital Iraqi interest. Saddam might nevertheless
consider a last minute tactical declaration of some of his WMD to avert a war,
believing that he can rebuild his WMD capability later.”

•	

“Saddam does not appear to realise the severity of the military attack he faces.
Senior Iraqi officials, although increasingly convinced of the inevitability of a
US‑led attack, are unlikely to be telling Saddam about their concerns.”

•	

“Saddam has not lost control or the capacity for rational tactical decisions. He
continues to maintain regime cohesion, primarily through intimidation. He is
unlikely to agree to relinquish power or to go into exile. He still believes he has
a chance of averting military action or, once military action begins, forcing the
Coalition to cease hostilities before his regime collapses.”

•	

“Once military action has begun, widespread lack of loyalty to the regime will
become clear. Iraqis may not welcome Coalition military forces, but most will at
least acquiesce in Coalition military activity to topple the regime, as long as civilian
casualties are limited. A hard‑fought professional defence of Baghdad is unlikely,
although elite military and security elements closely identified with the regime may
fight until their positions become untenable.”

JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003, ‘Iraq: The Emerging View from Baghdad’.
Minutes, 29 January 2003, JIC meeting.

145

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

“Saddam probably believes he has some strong political and military cards to
play, even in the face of an inevitable attack. These include exploiting international
divisions over war with Iraq and rousing the Arab street. He may use human
shields, fire CBW against Coalition Forces, launch a pre‑emptive attack on the
Kurds, Coalition Forces building up in Kuwait or Israel, or sabotage Iraqi oil wells
and water supply.”

Inspections
The JIC had “judged in October” that:
“Saddam was confident he could prevent UNMOVIC from finding any evidence
before military options started to close off … and that concealment and dispersal
of sensitive items were the basis of Iraq’s strategy. [...] But by mid‑January there
were signs that Iraq was coming under pressure from UNMOVIC finds that were
inconsistent with its December 2002 declaration. [...]
“[...] Intelligence is unclear, but it is possible the UNMOVIC discoveries have
increased Iraqi uncertainty. Blix’s tough statement to the Security Council on
27 January surprised Baghdad and may have increased the regime’s concerns about
UNMOVIC. Saddam Hussein continues to believe that the possession of WMD is a
vital Iraqi interest. [...] Any WMD admission would therefore be tactical rather than
indicative of a genuine change of policy.”
Reading the outside world
The JIC assessed that:

•	

Iraqi officials were “increasingly convinced of the inevitability of a US‑led
military attack”.

•	

Saddam Hussein continued to “give the impression that military action, though
increasingly likely,” was “not imminent”.

•	

Saddam Hussein’s speeches in early January had been “bellicose, calling for
bravery and sacrifice in defending the homeland from invaders”.

•	

It was “not clear that Saddam and his officials” had “fully grasped the severity of
the military attack they face from the US‑led Coalition assembling in the Gulf”. [...]

•	

“Reporting … indicated” that Iraq believed the West was “squeamish about
casualties”.

•	

Saddam Hussein was “misreading the international scene”. Media reporting of
debate in the West might “well lead him to overestimate the impact of opposition
to military action on US determination to deal decisively with him”.

•	

Saddam Hussein might “also be unsure whether the aim of the Coalition [was]
regime change and disarmament or just disarmament”.

•	

Iraq “continued to seek support from Russia and China as well as Arab and
Muslim states. But such attempts to gather Arab and international support
appear overambitious.”

146

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

Iraq and terrorism
Addressing Iraq’s capability to conduct terrorist attacks and its possible intentions, the
Assessment stated:

•	

The JIC continued to judge that Iraq’s capability to conduct terrorist attacks was
“limited, especially outside the Gulf region”.

•	

The JIC had “previously judged that terrorism could be attempted against Coalition
Forces during a military build‑up if Saddam believed an attack was inevitable.
There [had] been no indication that Iraq was behind the recent attack on US
contractors … in Kuwait”. That had, however, highlighted “the vulnerability of the
large numbers of Coalition Forces concentrated in an area as small as Kuwait”.

•	

Iraq might “well seek to use its influence over some smaller militant Palestinian
groups to encourage them to strike at US and Coalition interests in the Middle
East in the event of a Coalition attack”.

•	

There were “also uncorroborated reports of Iraq assembling teams in various
countries to attack UK and US interests in the event of war against Iraq.

•	

Despite the presence of terrorists in Iraq with links to Al Qaida, there was
“no intelligence of current co‑operation between Iraq and Al Qaida”.

Iraqi military preparations
The Assessment stated:

•	

There were “continuing military defensive preparations, including deployments
and reinforcement of military units in the South, West and along the border of the
Kurdish autonomous zone” which appeared to be “directed against both the threat
of [an] internal uprising and external attack”.

•	

“Since early January part of the Iraqi 4th Corps has moved southwards, including
possibly 1,000 troops on the al‑Faw Peninsula, apparently in response to the
Coalition build‑up in Kuwait.”

•	

But Iraq’s options for redeployment in the South were “limited”: “Any significant
redeployment in the South would risk triggering a Coalition attack by breaching
the southern No‑Drive Zone.”

•	

The regime did “not trust the Republican Guard enough to deploy them in
Baghdad, except possibly as a last resort, leaving them exposed beyond the
capital’s boundaries”.

•	
•	

Iraqi preparations in and around Baghdad were judged to be “of limited utility”.

•	

Saddam Hussein would have “little incentive to launch such a strike while the
Iraqi strategy focuses on convincing UNMOVIC that Iraq does not have WMD
holdings”, but it might “become an attractive option in the face of imminent
Coalition military action”.

•	

There was “unlikely” to be “any advance warning of a pre‑emptive attack on the
Kurds”.

•	

A “pre‑emptive limited artillery strike on Kuwait using CBW could be launched in
as little as two hours”.

There had been “no clear indication of any plan for a pre‑emptive military strike
against the Kurds, neighbouring countries or Israel”.

147

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

“Preparations for a possible attack on Israel” were “likely to be more extensive and
to stretch Iraqi capabilities to the limit”.

•	

There were indications of “plans to sabotage oil fields to prevent them falling into
Coalition hands”.

Maintaining control within Iraq
The Assessment stated:

•	

The regime continued to “maintain regime cohesion primarily through
intimidation”.

•	

It had “attempted to maintain its hold by claiming” that the return of inspectors had
“averted a US attack”; the international community was “intent on disarming Iraq,
not on regime change”; the regime was “maintaining ‘business as usual’: anybody
thinking of deserting will face serious consequences”.

•	

Clear signs of dissent or defection might not be seen until the regime was “about
to fall”.

•	

Saddam Hussein had “sought to mitigate the regime’s unpopularity by promising
some measures of liberalisation”. Such measures had “little credibility” as the
regime had “made them under pressure in the past, then withdrawn them once the
crisis has passed”.

•	
•	

There was “little intelligence on Iraqi popular attitudes towards a Coalition attack”.

•	

Morale in much of the regular army was “low” and “many soldiers” were “reluctant
to fight”. “But as long as Iraqi security officers remain with military units and able
to enforce discipline, fear of execution is likely to keep regular units at their posts.”

The JIC judged that “most Iraqis will welcome the departure of Saddam. A few
reports suggest that some Iraqis may fight to defend their homeland from what
they see as external aggression. [...] Overall we judge that while Iraqis may not
welcome military forces, they will at least acquiesce in Coalition military
action to topple the regime, as long as civilian casualties are limited.”

Saddam Hussein’s mindset
The Assessment stated:

•	

The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein was “still in control” and was “unlikely to
relinquish power voluntarily”.

•	

Saddam Hussein would “fear the humiliation of exile, possible assassination and
the threat of trial before an international war crimes tribunal”. Suggesting to him
“that he step down to avert a war would be likely to provoke a murderous rage”.

•	

The prospects for a “Turkish initiative to promote a regional peace plan” did not
“look good”. There had been “no indication” that Saddam was “preparing to flee”.
There had been “uncorroborated reports of plans for Saddam’s family to seek
refuge abroad in the event of a Coalition attack”.

•	

Saddam Hussein was “under increasing pressure” as the inspections regime
intensified, UNMOVIC had made “significant discoveries” and the Coalition military
build‑up continued.

•	

The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein had “underestimated UNMOVIC’s capability
to expose his deception”. He had “failed to realise that he was facing a situation
different from the days of UNSCOM”. UNMOVIC’s “limited success” highlighted

148

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

the “risks Saddam took in providing a weak declaration of Iraq’s WMD‑holdings”.

•	

There was “no sign” that Saddam Hussein was “unstable or losing the capacity
to make rational tactical decisions”. He might “well believe” that he had “some
strong cards left to play”.

•	

Saddam Hussein was “already placing military targets in residential areas to score
a propaganda victory in the event of a Coalition air campaign”.

•	

“In the face of an attack, or even before hostilities if he judged that an attack was
imminent,” Saddam Hussein might take a number of actions, including:

•	

–	

making a last‑minute declaration of his WMD;

–	

taking hostages or exploiting “foreign volunteers from countries such as UK
and France as human shields”;

–	

moving “against the KAZ [Kurdish Autonomous Zone] to provoke a
humanitarian crisis and to provide a military distraction”;

–	

mounting a pre‑emptive attack against Israel to “provoke a wider regional
crisis and rouse the Arab street”; and

–	

inflicting “high enough casualties on any Coalition ground forces, perhaps in
Kuwait, including through use of CBW, to halt a Coalition attack and to swing
public opinion in the West against hostilities”.

“Once hostilities were underway”, Saddam might also:
–	

“seek to cause an international outcry over the level of Iraqi or Coalition
casualties”; and

–	

“pursue a scorched earth policy, including the destruction of oil wells and
poisoning the water supply”.

The JIC had judged in December 2002 that Saddam Hussein “would initially seek
international pressure to halt Coalition action”. If that failed, he “would seek to inflict
serious casualties on Iraq’s neighbours and on Coalition Forces, in order to undermine the
Coalition’s will to fight on”.
In its Assessment of 29 January, the JIC judged that Saddam Hussein still believed he had
“a chance of averting military action or, once military action begins, forcing the Coalition to
cease hostilities before his regime collapses”.

812.  Mr Scarlett assured Sir David Manning on 30 January that the intelligence
reporting was “consistent and convincing”, and there was no evidence that
Saddam Hussein was considering the renunciation of WMD.
813.  In addition to the JIC Assessment of 29 January, Mr Scarlett sent Sir David
Manning his “personal observations on the overall intelligence picture”.267 Mr Scarlett
wrote: “Our intelligence reporting has been consistent and convincing. I have not seen
a single reference to Saddam even considering the renunciation of WMD to save his
regime (and probably his own life).”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

814.  The details in the letter are addressed in Sections 4.3 and 6.2.

Cabinet, 30 January 2003
815.  Mr Blair held a meeting with senior Ministers to discuss Iraq before Cabinet
on 30 January, but there is no official record of what was discussed or the
conclusions reached.
816.  Iraq was discussed with Mr Prescott, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce
in a meeting before Cabinet.
817.  Mr Campbell wrote that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Mr Straw had told Mr Blair several times that he had to make clear [to
President Bush] that the UK could not go ahead without a resolution.
Mr Straw was also concerned about Lord Goldsmith’s reaction to some
of the proposed targets for the air campaign, “because he would feel that
disproportionate force was being applied”.
Adm Boyce had “warned that he was worried the Americans felt they would
be seen as liberators. It just wasn’t so. They would be resented.”
Mr Blair was “clear that he wanted” to get President Bush to a second resolution;
and he had “got the message that we couldn’t do without one”.
Mr Blair felt that “two or three Blix reports, and more time for Arab leaders
to push Saddam out” were needed.
Mr Hoon was “worried”; Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense,
was saying “that the problem with the UN route was that it was open‑ended,
that other countries just used the process so nothing ever happened”.268

818.  There is no No.10 record of the discussion.
819.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 30 January that he would be discussing the
policy on Iraq with President Bush the following day. Saddam Hussein was
not co‑operating fully and while the inspectors would need time to reach
a firm conclusion, that period could not be open‑ended.
820.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 30 January that he would be discussing the policy on
Iraq with President Bush the following day.269 The United Nations inspectors “needed
to be given clear direction following their report” to the Security Council on 27 January.
Saddam Hussein was “not co‑operating fully but the pressure on him to do so was
increasing. It would take time for the inspectors to come to a firm conclusion, but that
period could not be open‑ended.”

821.  In the subsequent discussion, the points made included:

•	
•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

Dr Blix’s report could be interpreted as an argument that containment had
worked: more explanation was required why we could not continue as before.
The onus was on Saddam Hussein to explain the discrepancies between the
Iraqi declaration and a series of unanswered questions: “about 223 missile
motors imported illegally; the production of VX nerve agent; 6,500 missing
chemical bombs; 12 newly stored chemical shells; and the refusal to allow
[Iraqi] scientists to be interviewed in private” listed by Dr Blix. Resolution 1441
“demanded Iraqi co‑operation: it was not for the inspectors to act like detectives
to find evidence of Saddam Hussein’s guilt”.
The British public was “supportive of the UN route, but was averse to being
rushed into war by pressure from the US”.
Military action could precipitate a humanitarian crisis involving internecine strife,
the release of Iraqi WMD or the breakdown of the UN Oil‑for‑Food programme.
The military build‑up continued and there would be announcements on the
call‑up of Reservists and the Royal Air Force contribution.
The importance of reviving the MEPP had to be constantly reinforced with
the US.

822.  Mr Blair concluded that Saddam Hussein “had the choice of either co‑operating
or being disarmed”. The UN route “should be pursued”. “More time was needed” to
allow the inspectors “to do their job properly and to ensure broad international support”.
American rhetoric was “weakening the Iraqi regime from within. If military action was
required we would need to make clear our commitment to the people of Iraq and to
managing the aftermath of hostilities to their benefit. The UN would need to be involved
in that process. Military action would be embarked upon only if necessary to enforce the
will of the United Nations.”
823.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been “clear that his role was to pull the US
into the right position” on a UN resolution; and that he had later left Cabinet to take a call
from President Bush, “from which he returned looking very worried”.270

Mr Blair’s conversations with President Bush, 29 and 30 January 2003
824.  Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on both 29 and 30 January.
825.  Mr Blair continued to emphasise that Dr Blix would need time to report
a pattern of non‑co‑operation from Iraq before it would be possible to secure
support for a second resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

826.  While Mr Blair had proposed on 24 January that inspections, and fortnightly
reports to the Security Council should continue until the end of March, the
timetable being discussed on 30 January was that a decision on a second
resolution could be sought after more reports from Dr Blix.
827.  In his diary for 29 January, Mr Campbell wrote:
“For obvious reasons, Iraq was worrying TB more and more. He wasn’t sure
Bush got just how difficult it was going to be without a second UNSCR, for the
Americans as well as us. Everyone TB was speaking to, including tough guys like
[John] Howard, was saying that they need a second resolution or they wouldn’t get
support. TB felt that was the reality for him too, that he couldn’t deliver the party
without it.”271
828.  Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that he should tell President Bush that:
“Even our closest allies are clear about their own domestic political constraints.
They would all much prefer a second resolution if at all possible. You have to have
one too …
“… a pattern of non‑co‑operation would not suffice for a French vote in favour of
a second resolution. Our assessment is that there are only four positive votes …
“So it follows that a WMD find or an Iraqi obstruction of the inspectors would
transform the international context. Short of that, we need a pattern of Blix reports on
Iraqi non‑co‑operation. This all points to a little more time – weeks not months – as
you argued in your Note, to improve the chances of securing a second resolution.”272
829.  The conversation on 29 January was brief.273
830.  Mr Blair congratulated President Bush for setting out the case on Iraq in his State
of the Union address. He told President Bush that he [Mr Blair] was speaking to several
colleagues so that he would have a clear picture of their positions before their meeting.
Dr Blix’s January report had been much better than expected and had helped to change
some minds.
831.  Mr Blair and President Bush agreed to speak the following day on a secure line.
832.  In their telephone conversation on 30 January, Mr Blair and President Bush
discussed the message that should come out of Mr Blair’s visit.274

833.  Repeating many of the points in his Note to President Bush of 24 January,
Mr Rycroft reported that Mr Blair said that:
“… having consulted other leaders it was clear that the issue was not time for its
own sake but time to secure a second resolution. Leaving aside public opinion,
a second resolution would help protect us against any unexpected events during
a military campaign. Saddam had no intention of complying with 1441 so Bush
was right to ensure that this did not drag on. The Prime Minister thought that we
needed two more Blix reports, one every two weeks, to build up a pattern of Iraqi
non‑co‑operation. At that point, all other countries including France could possibly
come on side for a second resolution. But they would need a reason to change
their position, which Blix’s reports could provide. For instance, it would be difficult
for Putin to support a second resolution next week but he might do so in the future.
This could make it impossible for France to attract sufficient support. If they vetoed
alone, the French would be the unilateral ones.”
834.  Following a discussion of President Bush’s position, Mr Blair accepted that there
would be a need to “maintain a position of strength and exhibit increased confidence
in our case. Blix’s role would be important.”
835.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the need to push hard for peace in the
Middle East and dealing with WMD proliferation by countries beyond Iraq.

Mr Blair’s meeting with Mr Aznar, 30 January 2003
836.  Mr Blair suggested to Mr José Maria Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister,
that a second resolution could be sought in late February, but not earlier.
837.  Mr Blair met Mr Aznar in Madrid on 30 January on his way to Washington.275
The meeting was followed by a press conference.
838.  Mr Blair told Mr Aznar that he had told President Bush that a second resolution
was politically necessary for the UK. If the inspectors did not find any WMD, the “next
best outcome would be for Blix to establish through a second and third report to the
Security Council that Iraq was refusing full co‑operation”. The UK should thereafter,
in early March, seek a second resolution when, “assuming strong Blix reports”, Mr Blair
judged Russia would not object and France would need to choose whether to veto.
Mr Blair also suggested allowing time after a second resolution for Arab countries
to try to force Saddam Hussein into exile.
839.  Mr Blair and Mr Aznar discussed the impact of a veto on the UN and, therefore,
the need to avoid one; and whether it would be better to seek a second resolution in
mid‑ rather than late February. Mr Blair argued that the situation could not be allowed
to “drag on, but it was important to give it a little longer”. He acknowledged that public

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

opinion was moving against military action but suggested it could be brought round.
Mr Blair’s preference was to wait until the end of February, including to allow further
reports from Dr Blix, which would highlight Iraq’s non‑compliance, and give time to
work on Security Council members.
840.  Mr Blair thanked Mr Aznar for his role in the joint article and stated that he would
propose “a system of communications co‑ordination” to President Bush.
841.  Asked what would happen if there was no second resolution, Mr Blair responded
that “he thought military action would follow anyway, but in far tougher political
circumstances”; and “The aftermath would be much easier to handle if the UN
had authorised military action and the subsequent rebuilding of Iraq.”

Papers produced for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush
842.  Mr Blair was sent a number of papers from across Whitehall before his
meeting with President Bush.
843.  In preparation for the meeting with President Bush, Mr Rycroft sent Mr Blair a pack
of “background papers” on 30 January.276 He added that there would be “plenty of other
papers, including JIC papers to give you on the plane”.
844.  The papers on Iraq were produced by the FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet Office.
845.  Mr Jim Drummond, the Assistant Head of OD Sec (Foreign Policy), sent Mr Rycroft
a minute setting out a “few OD Sec points, just in case they slip through the briefing”
provided by the FCO and MOD.277 Those included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

the need to agree joint military campaign objectives for publication “shortly
before any conflict starts”; the UK should offer a draft;
an offer of “help on handling Iran”;
the “importance of transparency in the use of oil revenues”; and
the need for agreement on an “UNMOVIC/IAEA role in finding and destroying
WMD post Saddam”.

MOD LETTER, 29 JANUARY 2003
846.  The MOD drew attention to the implications which any delay in military action
beyond the spring would have for its ability to provide a major contribution for
military action, and the need for the US and UK to have agreed military objectives.
847.  The MOD briefing of 29 January comprised a general update and sections on
targeting, “aftermath”, and Saddam Hussein’s options, including Fortress Baghdad.278

848.  The MOD “line to take” suggested for Mr Blair was that, if military operations were
to be delayed beyond April/May, the UK would “struggle to put together this scale of
force again for the autumn, especially if the fire strike continues. So militarily we could
bear some delay but not too much.”
849.  The background briefing for Mr Blair advised that, if operations were not initiated
in the spring, the UK would “face some awkward choices”. Some “key elements of
the UK contribution were unique” – including the Commando Brigade, the Air Assault
Brigade and a specialist helicopter carrier ship. The MOD suggested:
“If operations were not going to start until the autumn, we would need to consider
bringing some forces back to the UK in the meantime. Our ability to provide a
major contribution later in the year will also be severely constrained if the fire strike
continues beyond the spring.”
850.  The MOD also advised Mr Blair that agreement on the objectives for a military
campaign would be needed. The development of the UK’s objectives and the discussion
of the legal basis for the conduct of military operations are addressed in Section 6.2.
851.  In relation to targeting, the “line to take” offered to Mr Blair was that the UK was
“working up our strategic objectives for a military campaign. We need to relate this
to the legal base we establish.” It was “Very important that UK and US objectives are
aligned soon and in advance of commitment to action so that we can come to a clear
and common understanding on targeting issues and the information campaign.”
That would need “careful handling domestically”.
852.  The background briefing for Mr Blair explained that the current thinking was that
the objectives would be published “close to, or at the start of hostilities”. The MOD
explained that the military objectives would enable it to “satisfy” itself “that they
represent[ed] minimum use of force as required by international law”, and to use the
CDS Directive to indicate “what military missions are legitimate, including … what
targets we can legitimately attack from the air; and plan information operations”.
853.  A “publicly agreed set of aligned military objectives”, being prepared by the
Cabinet Office, would enable the UK to participate in a “joined up information
operations campaign”.
FCO ADVICE, 30 JANUARY 2003
854.  The FCO focused on the need for more time in the hope of disarming
Iraq without military action and, if that was not possible, support for a second
resolution.

155

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

855.  The briefing paper for Mr Blair prepared by the FCO Middle East Department
on 30 January described the objectives for the meeting as:
“to convince President Bush that:

•	
•	

our strategy, though working, needs more time;

•	

a second UN Security Council resolution (i) would greatly strengthen the
US’s position, (ii) is politically essential for the UK, and almost certainly
legally essential as well;

•	
•	

the military campaign will be very shocking in many parts of the world,
especially in its opening phase (five times the bombing of the [1991]
Gulf War);

we should support Saudi ideas for disarmament and regime change with
UN blessing;
the US needs to pay much more attention, quickly, to planning on ‘day after’
issues; and that the UN needs to be central to it.”279

856.  The paper set out a number of key messages for Mr Blair to convey to
President Bush reflecting those objectives, including:

•	
•	

279 

More time would not be “stringing things out: it is patience with a purpose”.
The disarmament of Iraqi WMD and the departure of Saddam Hussein could
be achieved “with wide international support”, but we were “not there yet”.
There were three strategic advantages in “letting time work for us”:
{{

The military build‑up was “already producing some signs of fracturing in the
regime. We will lose nothing by letting the pressure build. We might be able
to achieve our objectives without firing a shot.”

{{

Inspections were “beginning to produce results … The Iraqis are rattled.
They are showing signs of non‑co‑operation (U2s, interviews). Blix brought
this out very clearly in New York … shifting the terms of the debate against
Iraq. More time will increase the evidence of systematic failure by Saddam
to comply. Before long likely to produce compelling evidence of Iraqi
deceit …”

{{

The mounting pressure was “finally galvanising moderate Arabs to work
with us to get Saddam out using the leverage of a second resolution.
We need to build up a plan on the basis of Prince Saud’s [Saudi Arabian
Foreign Minister] ideas covering who would have to go, and how we
would handle a transition to a new group of leaders who would meet Iraq’s
obligations under our supervision.”

A second UN resolution would be the “Basis for this approach”. It would
“transform the politics in the UK, Europe and the wider world” and it “might even
produce an implosion in Iraq”.
It would “take an effort to get the nine positive votes needed”.
Moderate Arabs might support military action “when the time comes”, but they
would need “a second resolution and wider international support for force, as
well as being seen to give Saddam Hussein one last chance to climb down”.
All the trends pointed to “a crunch time around end March”. The FCO did not
see how a second resolution could be obtained “in the next few weeks, absent
a dramatic new fact”.
The UK was with the US “100% on the goal; full disarmament by force and
regime change if necessary. But we have to contrive circumstances in which
we can carry a broad coalition and domestic opinion with us.”
Working with the UN would “produce a huge prize” in relation to rebuilding
Iraq with international support “which allows us to exit”, sending a “powerful
message” to other “would be proliferators”, and that domestic opinion would
be “more convinced by the legal case”. That was “worth taking time over”.
There was merit in the Saudis’ idea for Arab League pressure on Saddam
to go and the idea of a “UN trusteeship” was “worth close examination”.
An overall “winning concept” was needed which “should embrace both military
action and ‘day‑after’ administration in Iraq”. It would be “pointless and
damaging to win war and lose peace”.
It would be “irresponsible to abandon Iraq quickly after toppling Saddam”.
The “risk of civil war would be real” and “Iraq’s neighbours would get dragged
in, creating instability in the whole region”.
Coalition Forces would “not be seen as liberators for long, if at all. Our motives
are regarded with huge suspicion. The Iraqis … want us gone quickly. Our
occupation and administration of Iraq will become more unpopular and its
awfulness more debatable, the longer it continues.”
The “Blunt fact” was “that in those circumstances any reforms are unlikely
to stick. Iraqis will need legitimate international presence holding the ring
while they themselves set up new, Iraqi, structures.”
The period of “government by military coalition” should be kept “as short
as possible” and an “international administration with UN blessing”
introduced “quickly”.
Restoring the oil production would be “an immediate challenge”. The oil
sector would “need some technology and a lot of capital”. The US and UK
should “encourage an open investment regime and a level playing field for
foreign companies”.
The UK media and Parliament had “not yet focused on day‑after questions.
But it would be very difficult to sustain a UK contribution to day‑after if our

occupation of Iraq were opposed, in Iraq and in region.” The UK did not “want
a repeat of the 1920s”.
The UK agreed with the US “objective of a NATO role” but “there is very little
chance of getting a formal … decision at present”.

857.  A three‑page Background Note and an Annex setting out the views of key
governments was also produced.
858.  On the legal position, the Background Note stated:
“There are concerns that a second resolution authorising the use of force is needed
before force may lawfully be employed against Iraq to enforce the WMD obligations
in the UNSCRs. If a draft resolution fails because of a veto (or indeed because it
does not receive nine positive votes), the fact that the veto is judged ‘unreasonable’
is immaterial from a legal point of view.”
859.  In response to a request from Mr Blair, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle
East and North Africa, provided additional briefing on:

•	
•	
•	

the humanitarian situation – described as “the one area where US Day After
planning is reasonably advanced”;
options for a second resolution – work was “in hand” and details were “in briefing
pack”; and
UN involvement in the aftermath – that was “only likely to make progress if the
US side gets a signal from the President to take it seriously”.280

LORD GOLDSMITH’S MINUTE, 30 JANUARY 2003
860.  Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Blair on 30 January to emphasise that his view
remained that resolution 1441 did not authorise the use of military force without
a further determination by the Security Council.
861.  Lord Goldsmith’s minute to Mr Blair of 30 January,281 and the fact that he thought
it necessary to send such a letter despite having been told it was not needed for the
meeting with President Bush, is addressed in Section 5.
MR BLAIR’S NOTE, 30 JANUARY 2003
862.  A Note entitled ‘Countdown’ set out a checklist of issues for Mr Blair’s
discussion with President Bush.
863.  It reflected Mr Blair’s convictions that Saddam Hussein had no intention
of complying with resolution 1441 and the inspectors would report Iraq’s

non‑compliance if they were allowed more time. That would be sufficient to bring
round public and international opinion to support military action, even without
a “smoking gun”.
864.  A document entitled ‘Countdown’ appears in the No.10 files for 30 January 2003.282
865.  The Note set out a potential timetable for action which anticipated two further
reports from Dr Blix, on 14 and 28 February and each “harder on non‑co‑operation”,
leading to a UN discussion and a resolution “authorising action; or at least declaring
Iraq in material breach” by 5 March. Saudi Arabia might then have “10 days to mobilise
Arab opinion to try to force Saddam out” before military action beginning on 15 March.
It would be “preferable” if the report on 28 February judged that there was “no sign of
Iraq fully co‑operating” and that the inspectors could not “disarm unless there is full
co‑operation”. The timetable could be:
“… shortened if either dramatic find by Blix or 14 February report sufficiently hard;
lengthened, but not beyond end March, if resolution takes more time.”
866.  The document comprised six sections with very short bullet points in each.
Those were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“Military Questions”. Whether there were sound plans: in the event that Saddam
Hussein used WMD, attacked Israel, or destroyed oil wells; to keep rival groups
and tribes apart; and to avoid civilian casualties.
“Aftermath Questions”. What would happen immediately, “a new Iraqi
government or US run”? What type of Iraqi government would be the aim
in the medium term?
“Blix”. Had been given “very good intelligence”. The Note suggested; “Close
working”, “Persuasion of doctrine of non‑co‑operation”; “Tie in with ElBaradei”;
and “To be seen by coalition leaders”, including Mr Blair and President Bush
before 14 February.
“Related Issues”. A renewed push on Afghanistan; progress on the MEPP;
“HIV/AIDS and Poverty”; “North Korea”; “US/EU relations”; and “Oil”.
“Diplomacy”. The approaches to be adopted with a number of UN Member
States and the Iraqi Opposition, including courting Russia and China and
bringing them fully on board and finding a “way down” for France.
“Strategy”. The need for: a “Proper communications operation”; joint work on
planning; and “regular updates between principals, with clear and set agenda”.

Bush on the strategy on the flights to Washington.283 Mr Blair was extremely concerned

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

by the signals of mounting US impatience and was seeking to avoid a US decision to
take action outside the UN. He had concluded that he needed to secure more time and
President Bush’s support for a second resolution. Sir David Manning had reported that
the US “was really impatient with the UN” and advised Mr Blair that “we had to fight hard
for more time, that we should persuade them [the US] it was in their own interests”.
868.  Mr Blair was “clear in his own mind about policy and strategy, but worried
[President] Bush would not go for it”. Mr Blair saw his “challenge” would be:
“… persuading the US that it was in America’s interests to stay with the UN … it
would be total madness not to … but it was not going to be easy. He was aiming
to persuade Bush to wait until the middle or end of March and support a second
resolution before action.”
869.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had been “worried” after the telephone call with
President Bush (on 30 January) because the President had “sounded much more
frustrated re the UN, definitely listening more to those saying he had to go for it”. Mr Blair
wanted to take President Bush to one side to:
“… go through the whole thing. They [the US] may not like it, but Blix was the key …
They couldn’t just bully here. Blix had to get the evidence of non‑co‑operation
and we had to get the argument round to non‑co‑operation being a breach, but
we needed two or three Blix reports to get that …”
870.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair was:
“… really worried. He just didn’t know how [President] Bush would be … he wanted
as much time on his own as we could get, to persuade him [President Bush] that he
was more vulnerable than he thought. There was a risk of hubris. He needed world
support more than he thought, especially if something went wrong …”
SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S ADVICE, 31 JANUARY 2003
871.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that time would be needed to secure a
second resolution. Persuading France to change its position would be the key
to influencing others.
872.  A clearer understanding of the UK’s legal “bottom lines” was urgently
needed to inform thinking on a second resolution.
873.  A more consultative approach by the US would “work wonders”.
874.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised early on 31 January that Dr Blix’s report to
the Security Council on 27 January had “moved the debate from Iraq’s performance
to what we should do about its non‑compliance”.284 Russia, China, Germany and

3.6  |  Development of UK strategy and options, November 2002 to January 2003

France’s “contention” that “Iraq’s co‑operation was pretty good so far” did not “echo
in the Council”. But, at the same time, “all other Council members want to give the
inspections longer”.
875.  Sir Jeremy recommended that the UK’s approach to forthcoming discussions
of Iraq in the Security Council should be to:

•	

•	

•	

Hammer home the message that further time would be “a cop‑out”. It would
give “the Iraqis comfort” and mean that they did not need to “take the necessary
steps to comply”. Assuring Iraq that the Security Council was “determined and
willing to contemplate force” was the only solution to getting the Iraqis to “crack”.
Persuading France to change its position would be the key to influencing others.
Continue working as hard as possible to provide a “smoking gun” (or denial of
access) through UNMOVIC. That was “indispensible” and the UK should “fight
for time” for that. The planned presentation by Secretary Powell, to the Security
Council on 5 February, would need to be convincing: “A weak presentation will
leave us worse off.”
Develop our thinking on a second resolution: “Most crucially and rapidly we
need a clearer understanding of our legal bottom lines.” The “most realistic way
forward may well be an ultimatum”. Further work would be needed “on how best
that might be constructed (e.g. making use of the UNMOVIC clusters)”.

876.  Sir Jeremy stated that he would need discretion on the best moment to float
a second resolution, but at that stage he did not envisage the issue coming to a
head before the second half of February. Securing a second resolution would, in his
view, take time. Secretary Powell’s address to the Security Council would be used
to encourage discussion.
877.  Sir Jeremy concluded:
“Securing a second resolution is going to take time and some coaching of the
Security Council. Resolution 1441 took four times as long as we first imagined.
Our policy as we go into the meetings … [with President Bush] is therefore well
justified. A more nuanced and consultative approach by the US, even for a few
days, would also work wonders – focused more on why we need to deal with Iraqi
non‑compliance and less on the relentless drive to an inevitable war. Powell’s
decision to address the Security Council has to be used as discussion time,
not just a lecture.”

161

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Iraq letter, 31 January 2003
In anticipation of Secretary Powell’s presentation of 5 February, Dr Sabri wrote to
Mr Annan on 31 January requesting the US Government to “submit immediately its
alleged evidence” to enable UNMOVIC and the IAEA to begin investigations and report
to the Security Council.285
Dr Sabri also stated that the 518 inspections since 27 November, which included all the
sites identified by the US and the UK, had shown that the allegations were “devoid of
truth and had been drafted in order to distort the picture of Iraq and create pretexts for
aggression against Iraq and against the region as a whole”.

878.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock went to see Mr Annan on 31 January to bring him
up to date with the UK’s thinking.286
879.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Mr Annan that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The UK “would be encouraging the US to give the process more time and would
also underline the importance of a second resolution”.
The UK wanted to hear Dr Blix’s report on 14 February and might want another
one after that.
He did not think there would be military action during February.
“We were concerned to ensure enough time (even beyond that [late February])
to make it as likely as possible we could secure a second resolution.”
“The only way to resolve this issue without force was for Saddam to crack and
preferably to leave (though we realised the latter seemed unlikely at present).”

880.  Sir Jeremy also asked whether what he had proposed “offended Annan’s bottom
line on the need to safeguard the international system”. Mr Annan had replied that
it did not.
881.  Mr Campbell wrote that, “going over the same questions again and again”
in Washington on 31 January before the meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair:
“… kept saying we needed a clear intellectual construct, which was that 1441 focus
should be on co‑operation issues, if the Iraqis didn’t co‑operate and Blix makes
that clear repeatedly, we should say so and then we go for a second resolution and
action could follow. We had allowed the goalposts to be moved to the smoking‑gun
issue, and instead it had to be about the inspectors not getting co‑operation.”287

Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, 31 January 2003
882.  When Mr Blair met President Bush on 31 January it was clear that the
window of opportunity before the US took military action would be very short.
The military campaign could begin “around 10 March”.
883.  President Bush agreed to support a second resolution to help Mr Blair.
Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready to do
whatever it took to disarm Saddam” Hussein.
884.  The absence of discussion about planning for the post‑conflict administration
and reconstruction of Iraq is addressed in Section 6.5.
885.  Mr Blair and President Bush had a two‑hour meeting in Washington on 31 January
followed by a press conference and an informal dinner.288
886.  The meeting began with a presentation on the threat posed by Abu Musab
al‑Zarqawi289 and the Al Qaida poisons network by a US official. Sir Richard Dearlove
attended that part of the discussion.
887.  The remainder of the discussion focused on the issue of a second UN resolution
and the timetable of a military campaign.
888.  Following a discussion of whether a second resolution would help the UK and the
relationship between US planning for military action and the diplomatic strategy, Mr Blair
confirmed that he was:
“… solidly with the President and ready do whatever it took to disarm Saddam.”
889.  Mr Blair added that he firmly believed that it was essential to tackle the threats
posed by WMD and terrorism. He wanted a second resolution if we could possibly get
one because it would make it much easier politically to deal with Saddam Hussein.
He believed that a second resolution was in reach. A second resolution was an
insurance policy against the unexpected.
890.  Mr Blair set out his position that the key argument in support of a second
resolution must rest on the requirement in 1441 that Saddam Hussein must co‑operate
with the inspectors. Dr Blix had already said on 27 January that this was not happening;
he needed to repeat that message when he reported to the Security Council in
mid‑February and at the end of February/early March. That would help to build the case
for a second resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

891.  Mr Blair added that there were various uncertainties:

•	
•	

Saddam Hussein might claim at the eleventh hour to have had a change
of heart.
We could not be sure that Dr Blix’s second and third reports would be as helpful
as his first.

892.  Mr Blair was, therefore, flexible about the timing of the second resolution. If we
could get it quickly, “well and good”. But the key was to ensure that we secured it.
We had taken the UN route in the expectation that the UN would deal with the Iraq
problem, not provide an alibi for avoiding the tough decisions. Resolution 1441 was
clear that this was Saddam Hussein’s final opportunity. We had been very patient.
Now we should be saying that the crisis must be resolved in weeks, not months.
The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD and terrorism now.
893.  Mr Blair told President Bush that the second resolution:
“… was not code for delay or hesitation. It was a clear statement that Saddam
was not co‑operating and that the international community was determined to do
whatever it took to disarm him. We needed to put the debate in a wider context.
The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD and terrorism
now, whether in Iraq or North Korea, otherwise the risks would only increase.”
894.  President Bush and Mr Blair discussed Dr ElBaradei’s analysis on the aluminium
tubes procured by Iraq. They also discussed the uncertainties and risks arising from
Saddam Hussein’s potential actions.
895.  On military planning, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the possibility that
Iraqi forces would fold quickly. Mr Blair asked about planning for the aftermath. In his
view a UN badge would be needed. That would help with the humanitarian problems.
Mr Blair and President Bush discussed an initial military occupation, how to manage
the dilemma of managing the transition to civil administration and the nature of an
Iraqi government.
896.  Mr Blair concluded that the US and UK needed to prepare to organise on a “war
footing” working very closely together “particularly on our public communications”.
897.  Sir David Manning recorded that it was clear that the window of opportunity would
be only a few weeks. Otherwise the US would take military action. The military campaign
could begin “around 10 March”, and earlier if Dr Blix’s report on 14 February was tough.
The timing was “very tight”.
898.  The UK should do all it could to help the inspectors make a significant find and
work hard on the other members of the Security Council to accept the “non‑co‑operation
case” to “secure the minimum nine votes when we need them, probably by the end
of February”.

899.  The FCO Iraq policy meeting on 3 February was informed that feedback from the
31 January meeting indicated that Mr Blair had “persuaded President Bush to allow time
for a serious effort to secure a second resolution”; and that Mr Ricketts would discuss
options and tactics with Mr Straw.290
900.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Sir David Manning’s record of the meeting
with President Bush:
“… made pretty clear they [the US] had made their minds up and that the campaign
was going to start … For Bush the diplomacy had to be based round the military
campaign, not the other way round. We had very short timelines now.”291
901.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair had told him that the meeting with President Bush
had been “the best … they had in terms of substance”. President Bush “had read and
digested” Mr Blair’s Notes and “was more on the same page than we thought, said he
intended to work hard for a second resolution and work to get a majority for it”.
902.  Addressing Mr Blair’s success in getting President Bush to support a second
resolution on 31 January, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote in his statement for the Inquiry
that it had not been easy to get US agreement “because of the spread of views in
Washington and because we had already used up much of our ammunition with
Washington on the utility of the UN route in securing [resolution] 1441”.292
903.  Sir Jeremy added: “It was noticeable … that President Bush’s words on this subject
in public were rather less warm and specific than those he had used with the Prime
Minister in private.”
904.  Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that President Bush had told Mr Blair: “We, ourselves,
don’t particularly need a second resolution, but we realise that you do.”293
905.  The record of the meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush on 31 January
confirms these elements of Mr Campbell’s and Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s accounts.294
906.  Mr Campbell also wrote that Mr Blair was “confident of getting a second
resolution”; and he was:
“… adamant that it was the right thing to do to get rid of Saddam and send out the
message that we were determined to deal with WMD. But he knew how tough it
was going to be. Expressing confidence in a second resolution was the best way
of dealing with that.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

907.  Mr Blair had “felt things had gone about as well as they could have done, but still
felt they [the US] were doing the right thing in the wrong way, and just wished they could
improve the way they put their case to the world”.
908.  In their press conference President Bush and Mr Blair stated clearly that time
was running out for Saddam Hussein to disarm peacefully; but neither stated a
commitment to securing a second resolution. That left their position ambiguous.
909.  In the press conference following the meeting President Bush expressed his
appreciation for Mr Blair’s “vision”, his “willingness to lead” and: “Most importantly …
his understanding that after September 11th, 2001, the world changed: that we face
a common enemy.”295 President Bush also stated that he trusted Mr Blair’s judgement
and appreciated his wisdom.
910.  Mr Blair stated that it was essential to mobilise international support and the
international community to deal with the linked threats of international terrorism and
weapons of mass destruction. That was “essential for the future peace and security
and prosperity of the world”.
911.  In the questions that followed, President Bush said twice that the timing of
a decision on Iraq would be “weeks, not months” and that was also Mr Blair’s view.
He added that the US would resist “any attempt to drag the process on for months”.
He had gone to the United Nations asking it to show that it had “the capacity to keep the
peace”. If the UN decided to pass a second resolution “it would be welcomed” if it was
“yet another signal that we’re intent upon disarming Saddam Hussein”: “But 1441 gives
us the authority to move without any second resolution.” Secretary Powell’s presentation
to the UN would “make it clear” that Saddam was “fooling the world, or trying to fool the
world”. He subsequently added: “Saddam Hussein would like nothing more than to use
a terrorist network to attack and kill …”
912.  Mr Blair did not answer a question asking if he had asked President Bush to secure
a second resolution. He stated that the judgement had to be that Saddam Hussein was
“not co‑operating with the inspectors, and therefore is in breach of the UN resolution”.
That was why time was “running out”.
913.  Asked if there was a link between Saddam Hussein and those who had attacked
the US on 11 September 2001, President Bush replied: “I can’t make that claim.”
914.  President Bush and Mr Blair both emphasised that Saddam Hussein had played
games for 12 years, and that he was still playing games. He had to co‑operate with the
inspectors and demonstrate he was disarming. If not, he would be disarmed by force.

915.  Mr Campbell wrote that he had wanted to get President Bush “as close as possible
to a second resolution” and to “tone down the rush‑to‑war talk”.296
916.  Mr Campbell added that there had been debate about what to say about a second
resolution. The White House Press Secretary had been opposed to the idea that
President Bush should say he was “open” to a second resolution because “that would be
seen as a shift in US policy”. President Bush had been impatient and the messages had
not been “properly prepared”.
917.  In Mr Campbell’s view:
“The overall impression was poor. TB didn’t really answer the question about
the second resolution. And though Bush said it would be ‘welcome’ he looked
uncomfortable and the body language was poor … Even though the words were
kind of OK, the overall impression was not.”
918.  Mr Campbell’s decision to give journalists travelling to Washington with Mr Blair
a report, ‘Iraq – its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’,297 and
the content of the report which became the subject of considerable controversy, is
addressed in Section 4.3.
919.  Accounts published by President Bush and Vice President Cheney
demonstrate that there were serious reservations about pursuing a second
resolution and whether it was achievable.
920.  In his memoir President Bush wrote that Mr Blair had gone to Washington “for a
strategy session”. They had “agreed” that Saddam Hussein had “violated” resolution
1441 “by submitting a false declaration”; and that they “had ample justification to enforce
the ‘serious consequences’”.298
921.  President Bush added that Mr Blair:
“… wanted to go back to the UN for a second resolution clarifying that Iraq had
‘failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it’.
“‘It’s not that we need it’ Tony said. ‘A second resolution gives military and
political protection.’”
922.  President Bush wrote that he “dreaded the thought of plunging back into the UN”
and that Vice President Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld and Dr Rice “were opposed”.
Secretary Powell had told him that “we didn’t need another resolution and probably
couldn’t get one”. President Bush added that if Mr Blair “wanted a second resolution,

we would try”; and that he had said: “As I see it, the issue of the second resolution is
how best to help our friends.”
923.  Vice President Cheney wrote that Mr Blair had “returned to Washington at the end
of January” to argue that “we needed yet another resolution”; and that he, Secretary
Powell, Mr Rumsfeld and Dr Rice:
“… were all in agreement that this was a mistake. We’d managed one resolution,
no one believed we needed a second, and it would be very hard to get …
“I also thought that going to the UN again would make us look hesitant and uncertain,
but Blair saw a second resolution as a political necessity for him at home …
“Britain was our major ally and when the President decided to try for a second
resolution, I understood his reasons.”299
924.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the main objective of his meeting with President
Bush on 31 January had been to secure US agreement to a second resolution for
political reasons.
925.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the main objective of the meeting on 31 January was
to convince President Bush that it was necessary to get a second resolution.300 That
“was obviously going to make life a lot easier politically in every respect”. Mr Blair added:
“we took the view that that was not necessary, but, obviously, politically, it would have
been far easier”. The American concern was that “they’d get pulled into a UN process,
you’d never get to a proper decision and then you’d never get the closure of the issue
in the way that you should”.
926.  Asked about President Bush’s view of the need for a second resolution, Mr Blair
told the Inquiry:
“President Bush’s view, and the view of the entire American system was that,
by that time, Saddam had been given the opportunity to comply …
“… he hadn’t taken it. Indeed, what we now know is that he was continuing to act
in breach of the UN resolutions even after the inspectors got back in there.
“So … the American view throughout had been … ‘This leopard isn’t going to change
his spots. He is always going to be difficult.’ So … their concern … that they’d get
pulled into a UN process, you’d never get to a proper decision and then you’d never
get the closure of the issue in a way that you should.
“The problem … from our perspective, was that … we wanted to carry on going
down the UN route, but the Americans had taken the view – and in a sense we

took the same view of the Iraqi behaviour up to … the end of January – that they
weren’t complying.”301
927.  Asked by the Inquiry whether a 2006 report in the New York Times, that President
Bush had said at the meeting that the Americans would put the work behind the effort
but, if it ultimately failed, military action would follow anyway, was correct, Mr Blair
responded:
“The President’s view was that if you can’t get a second resolution because, in
essence France and Russia are going to say no, even though … I don’t think they
were really disputing that Iraq was in breach of resolution 1441, then we were going
to be faced with a choice I never wanted to be faced with: did you go without a
second resolution?”302
928.  Asked if his position had been that he would take military action with the US if a
second resolution could not be agreed, Mr Blair replied that “all sorts of factors would
be in play”, including the legal question and whether there would be political support.
But, in the context of an Iraqi breach, Mr Blair was:
“… under absolutely no doubt … that, if you backed away, when he was playing
around with the inspectors in precisely the way he had done before, then you were
going to send a very, very bad signal.”303
929.  Asked if his recollection was that the proposed start date for military action
discussed at that meeting was 10 March, Mr Blair replied: “It was at that meeting
or around about that time, certainly, yes.”304
930.  In his memoir Mr Blair wrote that with the New Year there was a sense of being
“in the final phase”: “The first Blix report in mid‑January was clear: Saddam was not
complying.” Resolution 1441:
“… had been silent on the need for a further resolution prior to any military action.
There were legal debates as to whether it was necessary, and Peter Goldsmith was
again anxious about it. The Russians had become negative, and it was perfectly
possible that a second resolution might be vetoed.
“I was still thinking it might be possible to get a second resolution – George
[President Bush] was adamant he didn’t need one. Jack Straw and others
warned me that, without one, I might be unable to survive the expected House
of Commons vote.
“I was about as isolated as it is possible to be in politics. On the one hand, the US
were chafing at the bit and essentially I agreed with their basic thrust. Saddam was

a threat, he would never co‑operate fully with the international community, and the
world, not to say Iraq would be better off with him out of power. My instinct was with
them. Our alliance was with them. I had made a commitment after September 11 to
be ‘shoulder‑to‑shoulder’. I was determined to fulfil it.
“On the other hand, my isolation within Cabinet, let alone the PLP and large parts
of the media and public opinion, was colossal. And worrying, not because I might
go down … but because so much was at stake. War and peace. The struggle
against terrorism. The future of our treasured alliance. The reputation of the country
and its armed forces. Above all, people’s lives. Either way people’s lives, since
‘peace’ would not be peace for those in Iraq under the boot of Saddam.”305
931.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:
“The political debate then crystallised in late 2002/early 2003 around calls for
a second resolution.
“We discussed this at various Cabinet meetings, the first of which was from my
recollection, that of 16 January 2003. It was then debated again at 30 January,
6 February, 13 February, 27 February and 6 March Cabinet meetings. In addition,
of course, it was informally hotly debated everywhere. In this instance there was
no disagreement: everyone thought it was politically beneficial.”
932.  Mr Blair also wrote:
“There was no doubt this was the easiest thing politically, both domestically for the
Government and internationally, to build the broader coalition. So in January 2003
we began discreetly to canvass support. When asked, we said we were open to
one but did not need one. I also knew that Robin Cook was likely to resign in the
absence of one.
“We certainly believed at the outset that if we could push the US to go for it, we had
a real chance of getting it, though it would be very difficult. Germany’s leader had
apparently told President Bush that it would not support but it would not oppose.
There were reasonable discussions with France, though by early February, France
had hardened again. The US were working hard on the Russians.”306
933.  Mr Blair added:
“We knew we would not ever get a resolution explicitly authorising force. But we
thought it possible that the resolution might state what we all knew to be the case:
that Saddam was not fully and unconditionally co‑operating. The Blix reports were
clear that any co‑operation fell short. In particular, Blix lacked the ability to conduct
interviews without restrictions, a key issue for the inspections. So a ‘final’ final
ultimatum resolution might be agreed.”

934.  The Inquiry asked Mr Blair at what point he had concluded that the US “had
definitely decided on military action in March 2003”.307
935.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:
“It was clear from continuing discussion with the US in late 2002/early 2003 that
March was the likely date for military action. That firmed up as it became plain
that there was no significant shift in the attitude of Saddam. The December
declaration … was incomplete, as Blix noted … His first report was to the effect that
there was not full compliance, essentially around interviews. There were various
possible alternatives to military action surfacing, including proposals for Saddam
peacefully to give up power.”308
936.  In the context of questions about his decision not to tell President Bush privately
that he was at that stage being advised by Lord Goldsmith that a second resolution
would be needed to provide the legal basis for UK participation in military action, Mr Blair
told the Inquiry that President Bush knew perfectly well that the UK needed a second
resolution. He added:
“If I had started raising legal issues at that point with the President, I think it would
have started to make him concerned as to whether we were really going to be there
or not and what was really going to happen. Now I would have done that because
in the end whatever I thought about the legal position, the person whose thoughts
mattered most and definitively were Peter [Goldsmith]’s, but I wasn’t going to do that
until I was sure about it.”309
937.  Lord Goldsmith’s position is addressed in more detail in Section 5.
938.  Asked when the question of more time had come up against the US military
timetable, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry:
“The issue, I think, of timing becomes acute after 1441 and the declaration.
Once Saddam has produced his 12,000 pages and the Americans decide this
is not serious, then they just want to get on with it really.”310
939.  Asked whether the military timetable was so fixed that time was running out,
Sir David replied that the build up of troops meant there was “a sort of pressure to
move forward”, and:
“There’s also the American political timetable ticking. Bush wants this well out of the
way before going into the mid‑term election process in – the build‑up for elections
the following year …”311

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

The views of Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock
940.  The evidence set out in this Section demonstrates that, by the end of
January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq was failing fully to comply
with resolution 1441, and that this was a further material breach.
941.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that Saddam Hussein:
“… was deliberately concealing documentation, and … he was deliberately
not allowing people to be interviewed properly.
“In December 2002 … we received information, and this information remains valid,
that Saddam called together his key people and said that anybody who agreed
to an interview outside of Iraq was to be treated as a spy.”312
942.  Mr Blair suggested that Saddam Hussein:
“… retained full intent to restart his programme, and, therefore, it was very
important for him that interviews did not take place, because the interviews with
senior regime members were precisely what would have indicated the concealment
and the intent.”313
943.  Asked whether there was a risk that, in putting down the second resolution the
UK would appear to be trying to curtail the inspection process because of the demands
of the military planning, Mr Blair replied:
“It was more … the other way round, that what we were trying to do was to say: ‘how
do you resolve what, on any basis, is a somewhat indistinct picture being painted by
Dr Blix?’”314
944.  In his memoir Mr Blair quoted at length from Dr Blix’s report of 27 January, which
he described as providing “essential context to understanding the decisions being taken
by me and others”.315
945.  Mr Blair wrote that the report was:
“… critical to understand the context in which WMD were being debated in the
run‑up to the outbreak of conflict. We the key allies had no doubt that Saddam
had an active WMD programme …
“There could be no doubt that the only reason for the inspectors being allowed back
into Iraq was a threat of military action. The build‑up of American forces was likewise
the only conceivable reason for what co‑operation there was. But the co‑operation
fell short of what resolution 1441 demanded. And the history of dealing with Saddam
did not exactly lead to belief in his fidelity to the UN.”

946.  Mr Blair wrote that he still “pinned some considerable hope on getting a diplomatic
breakthrough”; and that the prospect of a second resolution “was central”. But it was
apparent that “the law and politics were inextricably intertwined”. Above all, a second
resolution “would reunite the international community”.
947.  In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:
“So I thought inspections necessary but I knew they would only be successful with
genuine co‑operation. The key to successful inspections was the ability to interview
and analyse the work of the technical experts. The JIC reports of 11 October 2002
and then following the December 2002 declaration, of 18 December 2002 gave me
no grounds for believing inspections would be properly complied with.”316
948.  Mr Blair added:
“The Iraqi declaration … and the Blix reports to the UNSC were as unsatisfactory as
we anticipated. It was clear Saddam was not fully complying, i.e. he was in breach of
[resolution] 1441, but as the prospect of military action advanced, so he was inclined
to co‑operate more. This is what JIC papers had said he would do.”
949.  Mr Blair also wrote that the declaration was “incomplete” and “That itself was
a breach of [resolution] 1441.”317
950.  Asked if he had concluded quite early after the declaration that there was no
prospect of Saddam Hussein complying with the requirements of resolution 1441,
Mr Blair replied:
“Yes. It’s basically correct …The intelligence reports were that he didn’t intend
to co‑operate, that the declaration wasn’t correct, but there was also a very
significant piece of intelligence at that time, which was … that Saddam had said that
anybody who co‑operated with overseas interviews would be treated as a spy, in
other words executed.”318
951.  Mr Blair explained that “some in the American system” had “tried to claim” that the
declaration was a material breach, but the advice he received and his attitude was that
action could not be taken at that stage.319
952.  Asked whether he had expected in December 2002 and January 2003 that Dr Blix
would report that Saddam Hussein was not co‑operating with the inspectors, Mr Blair
replied that, “given the history”, they had been looking for “very early and significant
signs that Saddam had genuinely changed the position of his regime”.320

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

953.  Asked if the US military timetable would leave enough time to see whether
UNMOVIC could do its job, Mr Blair replied:
“… the timeline was pressing … because the Americans took the view it was absurd
to think that Saddam was going to change his mind, because he wasn’t …”321
954.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested that the primary reason for the second
resolution was as a means to persuade Saddam Hussein to disarm peacefully,
although it would also have helped to provide a legal basis for action if required.
955.  Asked about the UK’s objectives for the second resolution, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
told the Inquiry:
“I think we had two objectives and I have thought quite carefully about this,
because those objectives became confused in the heat of battle and in subsequent
interpretation with hindsight of what happened.
“… the two fundamental points were, first, that we had to try and create international
pressure on Iraq to give up WMD without a fight, and it was only possible to do that,
as far as I was concerned, through the United Nations, by having a very firm body
of international opinion that was against Iraq and determined to bring to a halt its
12‑year contravention of UN resolutions. That was a primary purpose behind what
I was trying to design as a further resolution.
“Second, we were also concerned to establish the safest possible legal grounds for
the use of force if that should be necessary. We felt that we had legal grounds in
1441, but those grounds were contested. They were a matter of subjective opinion.
If one had a further resolution, establishing that there had been a material breach
since we had given Iraq the final opportunity, this would be unequivocal, and that
would be the safest possible legal grounds for the next steps, whatever they were.”322

Conclusions
956.  In December 2002, President Bush said that the Iraqi declaration of
7 December 2002 demonstrated Saddam Hussein had had “no change of heart”.
957.  By early January 2003, Mr Blair had concluded that the military action was
the more likely outcome and, if conflict could not be avoided, that the UK should
support the US.
958.  The Inquiry has already concluded in Section 3.5 that Mr Blair and Mr Straw
envisaged that in the event of a material breach of Iraq’s obligations, a second
resolution determining that a breach existed and authorising the use of force was
likely to be tabled in the Security Council.

959.  Lord Goldsmith was not invited to provide draft advice on the legal effect of
resolution 1441 until mid‑January and, at that stage, it was given only to Mr Blair.
960.  Lord Goldsmith’s position that a further decision by the Security
Council would be required to revive the authorisation to use force contained
in resolution 678 (1990), although that decision need not be in the form of a
further resolution; and that there was no “room for arguing that a condition of
reasonableness [could] be implied as a precondition for the exercise of a veto”,
is addressed in Section 5.
961.  That remained Lord Goldsmith’s view throughout the events addressed in
this Section of the report.
962.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw repeatedly stated, however, that military action would
be justified if the Security Council failed, in the face of a report of a further
material breach, to “face up to its responsibilities”.
963.  In public statements Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued to declare that reports
from the inspectors would be the basis for seeking a second resolution which
was regarded as an essential prerequisite for securing both UK domestic and
international support for military action.
964.  In January 2003, there was a clear divergence between the UK and US
Government positions over the timetable for military action.
965.  The decisions to deploy military forces to the Gulf and the absence
of collective discussion of the implications are addressed in Sections 6 and 7.
966.  On 24 January, Mr Blair sent President Bush a proposal suggesting the
inspectors should be given until the end of March or early April to carry out their
task and asking for fortnightly reports to the Security Council on the extent of
Iraqi compliance.
967.  Mr Blair considered that, if those reports established a pattern of
non‑compliance, they would, in the absence of other evidence that Iraq had
concealed WMD (a “smoking gun”), be sufficient to secure Security Council
support for a second resolution.
968.  The US and UK should seek to persuade others, including Dr Blix, that that
was the “true view” of resolution 1441.
969.  By the end of January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq
was failing fully to comply with resolution 1441, and that that was a further
material breach.
970.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw saw the meeting with President Bush on 31 January
as the best opportunity to gain US support for an approach designed to secure
a second resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

971.  The Inquiry recognises that events were moving fast and that Mr Blair was
seeking to influence President Bush’s position.
972.  President Bush agreed to seek a second resolution to help Mr Blair, but
there were major reservations within the US Administration about the wisdom
of that approach.
973.  Mr Blair confirmed that he was “solidly with the President and ready
to do whatever it took” to disarm Saddam Hussein.
974.  But President Bush was not prepared to agree a timetable which would
preclude US military action in early March.
975.  Mr Blair’s proposed approach to the discussion with President Bush was
discussed in a meeting of Ministers before Cabinet on 30 January and then
discussed in general terms in Cabinet itself. But no detailed and in depth analysis
of the strategy and its advantages and disadvantages, including the likelihood
of success, was prepared or discussed collectively by either senior officials
or Ministers. Nor were alternative options, which might have been available
to the UK at that stage, identified and considered.
976.  A review of the strategy would inevitably have focused on the tension
between the military timetable of the United States and the UK view that the
inspections needed more time before it would be possible to secure international
support and a further UN Security Council resolution.
977.  In the event, the approach failed to secure majority support in the Security
Council in mid‑March for a resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final
opportunity offered by resolution 1441; that the inspections had run their course;
and that military action was necessary as a last resort to disarm Saddam Hussein
of his weapons of mass destruction and the means for their delivery. That is
addressed in subsequent Sections of the Report.

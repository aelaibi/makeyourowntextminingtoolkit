3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

Introduction and key findings
1.  This Section addresses the development of the UK position on Iraq between
Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush on 31 January 2003, at which he sought US
support for a further, “second”, Security Council resolution before military action was
taken, and the meeting of the Security Council on 7 March, at which the UK, US and
Spain tabled a revised draft resolution stating that Iraq would have failed to take the
final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 unless the Council concluded on or before
17 March that Iraq was demonstrating “full, unconditional, immediate and active
co‑operation” with its obligations to disarm.
2.  During that time, the UK Government was pursuing both intense diplomatic
negotiations with the US and other members of the Security Council about the way
ahead on Iraq and a pro-active communications strategy about why Iraq had to be
disarmed, if necessary by force, against the background of sharply divided opinion
and constant political and public debate about the possibility of military action.
3.  Development of UK strategy and options between 8 March and the start of military
action overnight on 19/20 March is addressed in Section 3.8.
4.  Other key developments in February and early March are addressed elsewhere
in the Report, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The provision of advice by Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, on the legal
basis for military action to secure Iraq’s compliance with its disarmament
obligations is addressed in Section 5.
The planning for military operations in southern Iraq and preparations to equip
the forces deployed are addressed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 respectively.
UK planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq is addressed
in Section 6.5.
Advice and briefings on Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile
capabilities and its intentions in relation to concealing them from inspections and
in response to military action are addressed in Section 4.3.

Key findings
•	

By the time the Security Council met on 7 March 2003 there were deep divisions
within it on the way ahead on Iraq.

•	

Following President Bush’s agreement to support a second resolution to help
Mr Blair, Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued during February and early March 2003
to develop the position that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating as required by
resolution 1441 (2002) and, if that situation continued, a second resolution should
be adopted stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by the
Security Council.

179

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

On 6 February, Mr Blair said that the UK would consider military action without a
further resolution only if the inspectors reported that they could not do their job and
a resolution was vetoed unreasonably. The UK would not take military action without
a majority in the Security Council.

•	

Mr Blair’s proposals, on 19 February, for a side statement defining tough tests for
Iraq’s co-operation and a deadline of 14 March for a vote by the Security Council,
were not agreed by the US.

•	

The initial draft of a US, UK and Spanish resolution tabled on 24 February, which
simply invited the Security Council to decide that Iraq had failed to take the final
opportunity offered by resolution 1441, failed to attract support.

•	
•	

Throughout February, the divisions in the Security Council widened.

•	

The reports to the Security Council by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
reported increasing indications of Iraqi co-operation. On 7 March, Dr Mohamed
ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, reported that there was no indication
that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able to provide the
Security Council with an assessment of Iraq’s activities in the near future.

•	

Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), reported to the Security Council on 7 March
that there had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did
not constitute immediate co-operation, they were welcome. UNMOVIC would be
proposing a work programme for the Security Council’s approval, based on key
tasks for Iraq to address. It would take months to verify sites and items, analyse
documents, interview relevant personnel and draw conclusions.

•	

A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix
and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March and proposing a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to
demonstrate full co-operation, also failed to attract support.

•	

China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution authorising
the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its efforts to find a
peaceful solution.

•	

Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in
New York, advised that a “side statement” with defined benchmarks for Iraqi
co-operation could be needed to secure support from Mexico and Chile.

•	

Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the
Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action.

France, Germany and Russia set out their common position on 10 and 24 February.
Their joint memorandum of 24 February called for a programme of continued and
reinforced inspections with a clear timeline and a military build-up to exert maximum
pressure on Iraq to disarm.

1 to 13 February 2003
Parliamentary debates on Iraq, 3 February 2003
5.  Reporting on his visit to Washington on 31 January 2003, Mr Blair told
Parliament on 3 February that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating as required
by UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1441(2002) and, if that continued,
a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach.
6.  Mr Blair continued to set the need for action against Iraq in the context
of the need to be seen to enforce the will of the UN and to deter future threats.
7.  Following his meeting with President Bush in Washington on 31 January 2003,
Mr Blair made a statement to Parliament on Monday 3 February.1
8.  Mr Blair described Iraq as the “immediate focus of the visit” although he and
President Bush had also discussed the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP),
Afghanistan, and global poverty and development. Mr Blair also reported that he had
had meetings and discussions with other Heads of State and Government.
9.  Stating that, “We are entering the final phase of a 12-year history of the disarmament
of Iraq”, Mr Blair said that Saddam Hussein had “consistently flouted” 27 “separate and
categorical obligations” in a series of 17 resolutions. That was why a sanctions regime
had been in place, which “because of the way in which Saddam has applied it, has
caused wholly unnecessary suffering for the Iraqi people”.
10.  Mr Blair stated:
“Eight weeks have now passed since Saddam was given his final chance.
Six hundred weeks have passed since he was given his first chance. The
evidence of co-operation withheld is unmistakable. Saddam has still not answered
the questions concerning thousands of missing munitions and tons of chemical and
biological agents unaccounted for.”
11.  Mr Blair reported the recent finds by the weapons inspectors and drew attention
to the report published by No.10 the previous weekend, which made clear that Iraq had
“a huge infrastructure of deception and concealment designed to prevent the inspectors
from doing their job”.
12.  That report, the No.10 dossier, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception
and Intimidation’, is addressed in Section 4.3.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

13.  Referring to the report by Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of the UN
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), to the Security Council
on 27 January, including his comments that Iraq did not appear to have come to a
genuine acceptance of the disarmament demanded, and that the discovery of chemical
rocket warheads could be the “tip of an iceberg”, Mr Blair added:
“The situation therefore could not be clearer. There is a duty on Saddam to
co‑operate fully. At present, he is not co-operating fully. Failure to do so is a material
breach of resolution 1441. Should Dr Blix continue to report Iraqi non-co‑operation,
a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach. President
Bush and I agreed that we should seek maximum support for such a resolution,
provided, as ever, that seeking such a resolution is a way of resolving the issue,
not delaying or avoiding dealing with it at all.”
14.  Mr Blair also drew attention to the “powerful evidence of the continuing terrorist
threat” which had appeared over the past few weeks. Terrorist groups were “actively
seeking to use chemical or biological means to cause as much death and injury and
suffering as they can”.
15.  Mr Blair stated that Iraq was not alone in developing weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) and repeated his warning that:
“… unless we take a decisive stand now as an international community, it is
only a matter of time before these threats come together. That means pursuing
international terrorism across the world in all its forms. It means confronting nations
defying the world over weapons of mass destruction. That is why a signal of
weakness over Iraq is not only wrong in its own terms. Show weakness now and
no one will ever believe us when we try to show strength in future. All our history,
especially British history, points to this lesson. No one wants conflict. Even now,
war could be avoided if Saddam did what he is supposed to do. But if having made
a demand backed up by a threat of force, we fail to enforce that demand, the result
will not be peace or security. It will simply be returning to confront the issue again
at a later time, with the world less stable, the will of the international community less
certain and those repressive states or terrorist groups that would destroy our way
of life emboldened and undeterred.”
16.  Mr Blair concluded that he hoped that conflict with Iraq could be avoided and that
Saddam Hussein “can come to his senses, co-operate fully and disarm peacefully”.
But if he did not:
“… he must be disarmed by force. If we have to go down that route, we shall do
all we can to minimise the risks to the people of Iraq, and we give an absolute
undertaking to protect Iraq’s territorial integrity …
“Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction and the threats they pose to the world must
be confronted. In doing so, this country and our Armed Forces will be helping the
long-term peace and security of Britain and the world.”
182

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

17.  In response, Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, stated that his party
fully supported the UN route and he hoped a second resolution would be possible:
“Although it is not a prerequisite for future action, it is highly desirable.” He stated that
the “fundamental problem is not lack of time, but the attitude of Saddam Hussein”.
He agreed with Mr Blair that “if the international community backs away from dealing
with Saddam Hussein now, that will be seen as a green light by every rogue state and
terrorist group around the world”.
18.  Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, referred to the extent of
public anxiety about developments and “a sense that we seem to be hastening into war
ahead of the events”. He stated that the Government had “still to make a credible case”,
and: “That case, for any fair-minded person viewing it, has to be based on credible
evidence, which has not so far been forthcoming.”
19.  Mr Blair responded that, after 12 years of trying to get disarmament, resolution
1441 offered Saddam Hussein a final opportunity. That was “hardly hastening into a
war”. It was a response to Saddam Hussein’s “point blank” refusal to do what the United
Nations had asked. If, as Dr Blix had said, Saddam Hussein was “carrying on in breach
of his obligations, that was “credible evidence” that he was not co-operating. The United
Nations had decided that Saddam Hussein was in breach of its resolutions and he had
“got to produce the evidence that he is now co-operating fully – and he is not doing so”.
20.  Mr Blair added that the inspectors’ task was “not to engage in an elaborate game
of hide and seek”. That was the game Saddam Hussein had been playing for 12 years;
and it was “unacceptable”. The US had chosen to go through the UN process, “but that
process should be a way of dealing with this issue once and for all, not of kicking it into
the long grass again and avoiding it altogether”.
21.  In response to a question from Mr Donald Anderson, Chairman of the Foreign
Affairs Committee (FAC), about whether he feared that Russia, France or China might
“unreasonably” veto a second resolution, Mr Blair responded that he was:
“… working on the basis that people hold to both the spirit and the letter of resolution
1441. The process has integrity. Saddam has a final opportunity and he must
co-operate fully. If he does not, a fresh resolution will be issued. The logic of that
will take people along with us, especially when there are further inspectors’ reports
to come.”
22.  Asked by Mr David Heath (Liberal Democrat) whether he disagreed with a view that
war would be a potent recruiting tool for terrorist groups, Mr Blair responded: “If we are
taking action where we are obviously and clearly enforcing the will of the UN”, that view
was “not right”.

183

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

23.  Mr Blair added:
“… the people who will be most delighted to see the end of Saddam are the people
who are his first and primary victims – his own people. In those circumstances, I do
not believe that it will recruit people to the cause of terrorism … what will recruit
people to the cause of terrorism is a belief among these fanatics that the will of the
international community is weak, that it does not have a determination to confront
these issues, and that, when faced with the challenge, we will fail to meet it.”
24.  In response to a question from Mr James Paice (Conservative) about the need to
explain to the British public “the conjunction between the Iraqi situation and international
terrorism”, Mr Blair stated that “we have constantly tried to explain to people” that the
two issues of WMD and terrorism were “not separate”. Both represented “the threats
of the fanatical over the rational … [T]hreats to the civilised world from acts of barbarity.”
The fact was that the two issues were:
“… intimately linked … without a doubt, if we do not deal with both these issues at
some point … [they] will come together. It is simply not possible to have a situation
in which states are developing and trading in this stuff, with their scientists being
hired by the top bidder, and in which terrorist groups are well-financed and able to
recruit … It is not possible to have those two threats operating and for them not to
come together at a certain point, and the consequences would then be devastating.”
25.  Mr Blair stated that he was taking a risk politically on Iraq because he did not “want
to be the Prime Minister to whom people point the finger in history and say, ‘You knew
perfectly well that these two threats were there, and you didn’t do anything about it.
In the end, you took the easy way out …’ We know that those threats are there and
we have got to deal with them.”
26.  Asked by Mr Ian Lucas (Labour) to confirm that he would support military action
against Iraq only if the UN weapons inspectors certified that there was a continuing
material breach of UN resolution 1441, Mr Blair responded: “That is exactly the position
I have outlined. If the inspectors continue to certify that Iraq is not co-operating fully, that
is a material breach. It is precisely so that the inspectors can make those findings a fact
that we put them there.”
27.  Mr Blair’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords by Lord Williams of
Mostyn, the Lord Privy Seal.2
28.  Lord Strathclyde (Conservative) supported the need for action, stating that a second
resolution was highly desirable but it “should not be used as an excuse for delay”.
He also asked for further information about the specific danger Saddam Hussein posed
to the UK. He concluded that Saddam Hussein had been given “a second chance once

too often”; and that while no one wanted to go to war, “the dangers of stopping now may
be greater than going ahead”.
29.  Lord Wallace of Saltaire (Liberal Democrat) stated that the Liberal Democrats
supported Mr Blair’s efforts “to ensure that containment of Iraq” continued to be
managed multilaterally, and noted the “very careful balancing act” with the unilateral
language used by the US Administration. Questioning a linkage between rogue states,
WMD and terrorism, Lord Wallace concluded:
“What worries us most on these Benches is the extent to which the questions
of rogue states, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism are conflated, as they
are again in this statement. Terrorism is a real, long-term problem, and it will not
be resolved by military intervention in Iraq or by disarming Iraq. What worries many
of us about what we hear from Washington at the moment is what we perceive as
a lack of understanding about the long-term nature of the terrorist problem in the
Muslim world. We need to be sure that we are standing up for universal values and
not simply Western values, let alone American values … An upsurge of terrorism
after an invasion of Iraq is a possibility for us.”
30.  Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote
that Mr Blair “felt … we had finally got the focus where it needed to be, on the issue
of co-operation with Blix”.3

3 and 4 February 2003
31.  When Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet
Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), spoke to Dr Condoleezza Rice,
President Bush’s National Security Advisor, on 3 February. They agreed that a second
resolution should be “pursued energetically”.4 The UK and US approaches should be
carefully co-ordinated. Following a discussion of the positions of various members
of the Security Council, Dr Rice agreed with Sir David’s conclusion that, “we would
undoubtedly have to work hard to get our nine votes; but it did not look impossible”.
32.  Mr Blair told Mr José María Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, that President Bush
favoured a second resolution “in principle”.5 They agreed that the UK and Spain should
work together on a resolution.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

33.  Mr Blair telephoned Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President and Mr Silvio
Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister (who was in Moscow).6 Mr Blair also spoke
to a number of his other counterparts, with similar messages.
34.  On 4 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative to the
UN in New York, told Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, that the UK “had not
won as much further time as we wished” in the meeting between Mr Blair and President
Bush on 31 January, but “we still had the whole of February and a bit of March to work
with” and “the Americans would work actively for a second resolution”. The UK wanted
the UN inspectors to “deliver further results, because this would make it more likely that
the international non-proliferation system remained in control”.7
35.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice on 5 February that, while the UK would want
Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice before taking a firm view, his preference was
to start discussing a second resolution after the report to the Security Council
on 14 February by Dr Blix.8
36.  At the Franco-British Summit on 4 February, Mr Jacques Chirac, the
French President, made clear that inspections should continue unless the
inspectors reported that they could not do their job. War would be the worst
possible solution.
37.  Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, reported on 1 February that,
in a conversation about the forthcoming summit, Mr Maurice Gourdault-Montagne,
President Chirac’s Diplomatic Adviser, had emphasised that France had never been
a pacifist country, and was certainly not one now, and it was not anti-American and
never would be.9 But it was:
“… not acceptable for Europe simply to be dragged along in the US wake when our
interests did not fully coincide. In the case of Iraq, there was no disagreement on the
need to disarm Iraq, but all the options short of war had not been explored properly
yet, and we were being forced to march to an artificial US timetable which was not in
our interests. It remained to be seen whether Powell [Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary
of State] would produce much … [at the Security Council meeting on 5 February].
For the moment the French were still not convinced there were really major things
for the inspectors to find, or that Iraqi non-co-operation was sufficient to say they
were in breach of 1441.”
38.  Sir John wrote that he judged President Chirac was “finally beginning to think that
France is in danger of finding herself in a false position”, but he was “not yet ready to
move towards us very significantly”.

39.  Mr Blair told President Chirac on 3 February that he had agreed with President Bush
that if Dr Blix continued to report Iraqi non-co-operation there should be a second UN
resolution “within weeks”.10
40.  There was little movement on Iraq at the Franco-British Summit on 4 February.
Mr Blair stressed the value of uniting around a second resolution to put pressure on
Saddam Hussein to go without war. President Chirac’s view was that the inspectors
should be allowed to continue their work, with more resources if they said they needed
them. The issue of a second resolution would not arise until the inspectors said they
could no longer do their work. He was concerned about the regional implications of any
military action and the potential consequences of trying to introduce democracy in Iraq.11
41.  The No.10 record of the discussion reported that President Chirac doubted that
Secretary Powell’s presentation the following day:
“… would contain anything new. If it did, the inspectors should verify it … A second
resolution would be necessary for a war, but one was not needed yet since the
inspections should continue. If the inspectors said they could not continue their
work, there could then be a second resolution. If the inspectors reported continued
non-co-operation, perhaps a High Commissioner for Disarmament could visit
Baghdad, and the inspections could be strengthened.”12
42.  President Chirac’s public comments focused on the need to let the inspectors
do their job; he stated that war was the worst possible solution.13
43.  Mr Campbell reported that, after the meeting, Mr Blair said his strategy was
to get Saddam Hussein out without a war, by obtaining a second resolution then
persuading him to go.
44.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had called him late on 4 February,
following the Franco-British Summit, to say that “he could now see a way of getting to
the same place as Chirac”. In response to Mr Campbell’s comment that the “best thing”
for President Bush “was to get Saddam out without a war”, Mr Blair had replied:
“… that was his whole strategy, get the Blix report, then a second resolution, then
get the Arabs to press him to go.”14

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council,
5 February 2003
45.  Secretary Powell gave a long and detailed presentation to the Security Council
on 5 February setting out the US position on the threat posed by Iraq and its
failure to comply with resolution 1441.
46.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that he had agreed to pursue a second
resolution if Mr Blair wanted one at their meeting in Washington on 31 January; and
that “the best way to get a second resolution was to lay out the evidence”.15 He asked
Secretary Powell to make a presentation to the UN:
“He had credibility as a highly respected diplomat known to be reluctant about the
possibility of war. I knew he would do a thorough, a careful job. In early February,
Colin spent four days and nights at the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] personally
reviewing the intelligence to ensure he was comfortable with every word in
his speech.”
47.  In his presentation to the Security Council on 5 February, Secretary Powell stated
that he had asked for the meeting for two purposes:

•	

The first was to support the “core assessments” made by Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei on 27 January that:
{{ “…

Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance – not even
today – of the disarmament that was demanded of it”; and

{{ “…

•	

did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that
have been outstanding since 1998”.

The second was to provide “additional information and to share … what the
United States knows about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, as well [as]
Iraq’s involvement in terrorism”.16

48.  Secretary Powell stated that the information, “when combined with what all of us
have learned over the years,” was “deeply troubling”. There was “an accumulation of
facts and disturbing patterns of behaviour” that demonstrated that Saddam Hussein and
his regime had “made no effort to disarm as required by the international community”
and was “concealing their efforts to produce more weapons”.
49.  Secretary Powell provided tapes of intercepted conversations and satellite imagery
which he interpreted as demonstrating Iraq’s attempts to conceal activity to “clean up”
facilities before visits by the inspectors.

50.  Secretary Powell also stated that human sources had told the US that:

•	
•	

•	

The Iraqis were moving “not just documents and hard drives but also weapons
of mass destruction to keep them from being found by inspectors”.
“In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the
serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed
any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents
acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.”
“Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave
Iraq. Anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as
a spy.”
A “false death certificate” had been issued for one scientist, and he was sent into
hiding, and a “dozen experts have been placed under house arrest … at one of
Saddam Hussein’s ‘guest houses’.”

51.  Secretary Powell added that the “information and intelligence” pointed to “an active
and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep materials and people from
the inspectors”.
52.  Secretary Powell stated that Iraq had failed the test of providing an honest
declaration and the conclusion that Iraq was now in further material breach of its
obligation was “irrefutable and undeniable”. Iraq had “placed itself in danger of the
serious consequences called for in resolution 1441”. The Council placed itself “in danger
of irrelevance” if it allowed “Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively
and immediately”.
53.  Secretary Powell set out the “real and present dangers” posed by Iraq’s WMD,
in particular its ability using mobile production facilities to produce biological agent
and its ability to disperse biological agents “indiscriminately” (see Section 4.3).
Secretary Powell also described intelligence and information on Iraq’s chemical
weapons, nuclear weapons and long range missile programmes.
54.  Secretary Powell concluded by setting out the US position on the activities in Iraq
of Al Qaida and Ansar al-Islam. Iraq’s denial of those links and its support for terrorism
was “a web of lies”. The US was not prepared to run the risk of Saddam Hussein using
his weapons of mass destruction.
55.  Secretary Powell said that Iraq was not taking its last chance and the Council had
an obligation to ensure that its resolutions were complied with.
56.  During his presentation, Secretary Powell also drew attention “to the fine paper
that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi
deception activities”.
57.  Secretary Powell was referring to the No.10 document, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure
of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’, which is addressed in Section 4.3.

189

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

58.  Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, stated that Iraq was now in further
material breach of resolution 1441. If that continued, the Security Council should
meet its responsibilities.
59.  In a discussion of 29 January about the Security Council on 5 February, Mr Straw
told Secretary Powell that he had considered the idea that the UK should publish a
dossier alongside the US presentation but he “did not think it was a good idea since
it could only be an echo of his”.17 They also discussed how to address Iraq’s human
rights record.
60.  In his statement to the Security Council, Mr Straw described Secretary Powell’s
presentation as “a most powerful and authoritative case against the Iraqi regime” and
thanked him for “laying bare the deceit practised by the regime of Saddam Hussein,
and worse, the very great danger which that regime represents”.18
61.  Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 had given Iraq “a final opportunity to rid
itself of its weapons of mass terror, of gases which can poison thousands in one go;
of bacilli and viruses like anthrax and smallpox which can disable and kill by the tens
of thousands; of the means to make nuclear weapons which can kill by the million”.
62.  Resolution 1441 had strengthened inspections but without Iraq’s “full and active
co-operation” they could never be sure of finding all WMD in a country the size of Iraq.
But the inspectors’ reports on 27 January and Secretary Powell’s presentation could
leave “no illusions”. Saddam Hussein held resolution 1441 in contempt and was defying
the Council. He was questioning “our resolve” and was “gambling that we will lose our
nerve rather than enforce our will”.
63.  The resolution had “set two clear tests for a further material breach by Iraq”:

•	
•	

not to make “false statements” or “omissions” in its declaration; and
“to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation” of resolution 1441.

64.  In relation to the first, Mr Straw stated that Iraq’s declaration of 7 December was
“not full, nor accurate, nor complete”:

•	
•	
•	

It was “a false statement. Its central premise – that Iraq possesses no weapons
of mass destruction – is a lie.”
“The declaration also has obvious omissions, not least a failure to explain
what has happened to the large quantities of chemical and biological weapons
materiel and munitions unaccounted for by UN weapons inspectors in 1998.”
There was “no admission of Iraq’s extensive efforts to develop WMD since the
last round of UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] inspections ended”.

65.  Mr Straw stated that it was “clear that Iraq has failed” the second test. The briefings
to the Council had:
“… confirmed our worst fears, that Iraq has no intention of relinquishing its WMD,
no intention of following the path of peaceful disarmament set out in UNSCR [UN
Security Council resolution] 1441. Instead of open admissions and transparency,
we have a charade, where a veneer of superficial co-operation masks wilful
concealment, the extent of which has been devastatingly revealed this morning
by Secretary Powell.”
66.  Mr Straw stated that there was “only one possible conclusion … Iraq is in further
material breach” of resolution 1441. The Council faced a difficult choice. It would be
“Easy but wrong” to hope for a change of heart by Iraq. That would be “repeating the
mistakes of the last 12 years and empowering a dictator”.
67.  Commenting on Secretary Powell’s description of reports about the presence in Iraq
of “[Abu Musab] al- Zarqawi [Leader of Al Qaida in Iraq], and other members of Al Qaida,
and their efforts to develop poisons”, Mr Straw stated that: “It defies the imagination
that all of this could be going on without the knowledge of Saddam Hussein. The recent
discovery of the poison ricin in London has underlined again that this is a threat that all
of us face.”
68.  Mr Straw concluded:
“… time is now very short. The Council will have further reports from the
inspectors on … 14 February. If non-co-operation continues, the Council must meet
its responsibilities.
…
“This is a moment of choice for Saddam and the Iraqi regime. But it is also a
moment of choice for … the United Nations … the League of Nations … failed
because it could not create actions … It could not back diplomacy with the credible
threat and, where necessary, the use of force … At each stage good men said,
‘Wait. The evil is not big enough to challenge’. Then before their eyes, the evil
became too big to challenge. We slipped slowly down a slope, never noticing how
far we had gone until it was too late. We owe it to our history, as well as our future,
not to make the same mistake again.”
69.  In response to Secretary Powell’s presentation, most members of Council
stated that the information presented would require serious and thorough study
and encouraged Iraq to co-operate with the inspectors and provide answers to
the outstanding questions.
70.  Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, stated that the information Secretary
Powell had provided required “very serious and thorough study”. It should be handed
immediately to UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for on-site

191

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

verification. Baghdad must give the inspectors answers and inspections should continue;
they alone could provide answers on the extent of Iraqi compliance.
71.  Addressing the question of whether time was running out, Mr Ivanov stated
that resolution 1441 contained no concrete timeframe: “The inspectors alone” could
advise on how much time they needed “to carry out the tasks entrusted to them”.
Further resolutions could not be ruled out, but efforts should continue to do “everything
possible to facilitate the inspection process. That had “proven its effectiveness” and
made it “possible to implement Council decisions by peaceful means”.
72.  The international community was confronting new global threats and challenges,
and “The unity of the world community” would “continue to be the principal guarantee
of the effectiveness of the world’s action”.
73.  Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, stated that the UN had
chosen a policy based on:
“… three fundamental points: a clear objective on which we cannot compromise –
the disarmament of Iraq … a rigorous system of inspections that requires Iraq’s
active co-operation and that affirms the Security Council’s central role at each
a stage; and finally a requirement … our unity.”
74.  Inspections had already achieved “important results”. There had been good
progress in understanding Iraq’s nuclear capacity and no chemical or biological agents
had been detected, including in the empty warheads discovered on 16 January.
75.  There were “still grey areas in Iraq’s co-operation” and the inspectors had “reported
real difficulties”. The uncertainties reported by Dr Blix were “not acceptable”. France
had evidence of Iraq’s capacity to produce chemical agents and the possible possession
of significant stocks of anthrax and botulism toxin, and possibly a production capability.
The absence of long range delivery systems reduced the threat of those weapons,
but there were “disturbing signs of Iraq’s continued determination to acquire ballistic
missiles” beyond the range permitted.
76.  Mr de Villepin called for a “demanding démarche anchored in resolution 1441”
from the Council. France did not rule out recourse to force but, before going down that
road, consideration had to be given as to whether the nature and the scope of the threat
justified force. The United Nations had to be “at the centre of the action to guarantee
Iraq’s unity, ensure the region’s stability, protect civilians and preserve the unity of the
world community”.
77.  Mr de Villepin proposed arrangements to strengthen the inspections regime and
to agree a list of unresolved disarmament questions and a “demanding and realistic
timeframe” to address them. Iraq needed to do more. But France was convinced
disarmament could succeed if the international community devoted all its energy
to it and maintained its unity and cohesion.

192

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

78.  Mr Mohammed Aldouri, Iraqi Permanent Representative to UN, challenged the
“incorrect allegations” in Secretary Powell statement and reiterated that Iraq had no
weapons of mass destruction. He stated that inspectors had visited the sites identified
in US and UK reports in September and October and “none of the allegations” were true.
He also rebutted statements made by President Bush in his State of the Union Address
on 28 January (see Section 3.6).
79.  Mr Aldouri reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to pro-active co-operation with the
inspectors so that they could verify that Iraq was free of weapons of mass destruction,
sanctions could be lifted, and progress could be made on regional security by ridding
the whole Middle East of WMD.
80.  Reporting on the discussion, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that Mr Straw
and Ms Ana Palacio, the Spanish Foreign Minister, had strongly supported
Secretary Powell’s presentation and Mrs Soledad Alvear, the Chilean Foreign Minister,
had made a “noticeably stronger intervention”.19 Most other countries had, however,
argued for more time.
81.  Sir Jeremy commented:
“A dramatic day. Powell’s presentation was impressive – at the higher end of
expectations. It has pushed the rock further up the hill. It has also helpfully raised
the bar of inspections by underlining that the Iraqis will need to answer real
questions about their activities if they are to satisfy the inspectors …
“But I do not think it was decisive. Most Council members reiterated familiar
positions. The most significant shift was the … Chileans. French ideas … had an air
of desperation about them. But they could be the straw which many in the Council
attempt to grasp as the option other than war.”
82.  Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that Secretary Powell had given:
“… an extremely impressive presentation of the evidence we had of Iraqi WMD, but
it was not decisive. There wasn’t a smoking gun there in the presentation. There
hadn’t been a smoking gun presented by the inspectors to the Security Council, and
it seemed to many members of the Security Council that Secretary Powell was trying
too hard to establish a case for which there was no clear proof … it didn’t convert
the unconverted.”20
83.  President Bush wrote:
“Colin’s presentation was exhaustive, eloquent and persuasive. Coming against
the backdrop of Saddam’s defiance of the weapons inspectors, it had a profound

impact on the public debate. Later, many of the assertions in Colin’s speech would
prove inaccurate. But at the time, his words reflected the considered judgement
of intelligence agencies at home and around the world.”21
84.  In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote:
“… I was impressed with his delivery but I was most concerned about the substance.
He did not produce any evidence of the ‘smoking gun’ variety, despite effectively
claiming to possess such evidence. Worse, I was not alone in thinking that Powell
himself did not appear as though he entirely believed his own case.”22
85.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in private discussions over lunch, Mr Annan
commented that the forthcoming visit to Baghdad by Dr Blix and Dr Mohamed ElBaradei,
Director General of the IAEA, could be used to tell Iraq that the Security Council
“unanimously insisted on much improved co‑operation”.23
86.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had said he was grateful for the information
provided by Secretary Powell, which he would study carefully. If there were things
hidden in Iraq, the inspectors would try to find them. He had welcomed the Council’s
wish to stay united and the message that Iraq must co-operate actively:
“This could not be a game of catch-as-catch-can. Co-operation had to be
spontaneous. UNMOVIC could do a lot with more resources and improved
equipment. But Iraq was a big country. What really counted was active
co-operation on the South Africa model.”
87.  Dr ElBaradei had “echoed” most of what Dr Blix had said: “There were plenty of
things to be clarified by the Iraqis … Iraqi co-operation must improve in a dramatic way.”
88.  Asked by Secretary Powell to explain his idea of reinforced inspections, Sir Jeremy
reported that Mr de Villepin stated he believed:
“… there was space between fully active co-operation and war for other options …
The Middle East was complex. A broader strategy was needed. Force had to be
the very last resort, and then only with the legitimacy of the UN. To win the peace
after the war, the involvement of the UN was essential. The inspection regime under
1441 allowed the Council this further possibility. Only if they [the inspectors] met
a deadlock would we need to come back to 1441. We could not afford to go to a
bloody, long, expensive war on the basis of impatience. Other states would draw the
conclusion that you needed nuclear weapons to avoid attack: compare North Korea.
Such crises had to be solved by the international community collectively.

“So the answer … was to use 1441 fully. Reinforce the inspectors. If after a time
it did not work, then force could be considered. The problems of the world had
to be solved through collective responsibility … If the route he had set out proved
unsuccessful, then France would assume its responsibilities with the rest.”
89.  Other points made during the discussion included:

•	
•	
•	

•	

Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister,
supported Mr de Villepin’s proposals for strengthened inspections.
Ms Palacio said that it was the message to Saddam Hussein that a change
of will was needed that had to be strengthened, not the inspections.
Mr Straw said that more inspectors and equipment would not solve anything.
The fundamental point was that “Iraq was not complying. If there was
co-operation, there was no need for greater numbers. If there was
no co-operation, higher numbers could not help.” The inspectors needed
intellectual evidence, “Yet Iraqi scientists had been terrorised into silence.”
Mr de Villepin’s proposal was “a chimera, a false message. And it would lead
to split in the Council.” The key was co-operation.
Mr Ivanov stated that there were complaints, but the inspectors had to continue
and Russia would help. President Putin had asked him to set out a list of the
current problems and work with the Iraqis to solve them. “Baghdad could hardly
change overnight … Pressure would be needed. But the opportunities for
a political settlement were far from being exhausted.”

90.  Sir Jeremy reported that, as Council President, Mr Fischer had tried to sum up that:
“There was agreement the Council should send out the message that a very serious
point had been reached. This was a major crisis with widespread consequences.
War would be very damaging. 1441 had to be implemented fully. Inspections must
continue: there was no contradiction between that and the presence of sharp
instruments. The message to Baghdad had to be that they now had to deliver.”
91.  Secretary Powell had not, however allowed that to stand. He had listened to the
arguments for a peaceful solution but the Council had “so far been denied that”. The US:
“… was not fixated on war … But he would not accept the premise that the world
could not accept the risks. He hoped it would not come to war. But war could even
produce good results. If it came to that point, the US would be happy to act with
a coalition of the willing under the authority of the UN, in the full understanding
of the risk of unintended consequences and of the overall situation in the Middle
East. Too much time had already gone by.”

195

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

92.  In his memoir, Mr Annan recounted the exchanges during that lunch in some detail,
commenting that it captured:
“… as few other moments do in that year of extraordinary drama and diplomatic
maneuvering [sic], the depth of passions, and the way in which the question of Iraq
became about something far larger: the foundations of peace and security, and the
place of the United Nations as the sole legitimate authority to endorse the use of
force except in cases of self-defense.”24
93.  Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, reported that the
US Administration:

•	
•	
•	

was satisfied with the impact of Secretary Powell’s presentation;
hoped that it might help to capture the swing vote in the Security Council; and
believed that the session had shown that the US had gone the extra mile along
the UN route.25

94.  President Bush had announced that the US would welcome and support a new
resolution “which made clear that the Security Council stood behind its previous
demands”; and that he had “repeated his resolve to lead a coalition of the willing
if necessary to disarm the Iraqi regime”.
95.  Sir Christopher also reported that support for action was growing. An NBC poll
published on 5 February showed that 60 percent of Americans supported military
action in Iraq, and the number of Americans who would strike without UN support
had increased from 29 percent in January to 37 percent.

Cabinet, 6 February 2003
96.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 February that if Iraq’s non-compliance continued,
a fresh resolution would be sought from the Security Council.
97.  Mr Straw told Cabinet it should be possible to gain consensus on such
a resolution.
98.  Cabinet agreed that Ministers should actively make the case for the
Government’s position on Iraq.
99.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 February that “the Government’s policy on Iraq was
on track”.26 If the UN inspectors continued to report Iraqi “non-compliance with its
obligations”, a fresh resolution would be sought from the Security Council. There was
“mounting impatience on the part of Arab countries” with Saddam Hussein and their
opinion would be “more favourable to military action if the US pushed the Middle East

Peace Process forward so that the agenda of the international community did not appear
one-sided”. Following his discussion with President Bush, on 31 January, Mr Blair
reported US willingness to re-engage.
100.  Mr Blair said that the next step was for Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to return
to Baghdad:
“It was possible that Saddam Hussein would show some movement towards
compliance; the Coalition military build-up would continue in the Gulf; and
planning for the aftermath of military action and humanitarian relief needed
greater emphasis.”
101.  France had “proposed more resources to support the inspectors”, but Mr Blair said
that “the issue was rather the lack of Iraqi co-operation, including their failure to explain
the weapons of mass destruction material which had been logged as missing in 1999,
and the intimidation of scientists whom the inspectors wished to interview”.
102.  Mr Blair also stated that it was important to use the UN process to address the
agenda of the international community more broadly, such as on North Korea and the
proliferation of WMD more generally. The “likely identity of interest between rogue states
and terrorists who wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction” was “of particular
concern”. The “presence of Al Qaida terrorists in Iraq was a reality which was part of
the changing picture”.
103.  Mr Straw said that Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council had
been made “forensically and calmly, with well chosen examples from intelligence of Iraqi
mendacity”. The “true colour and substance of the Iraqi regime had been highlighted”.
104.  Mr Straw’s view was that “it should be possible to gain consensus for a further
resolution” if the inspectors returned “without real concessions on Iraqi compliance”.
The  focus “had to remain” on the UN route: “We could now be entering the final phase”
with the next report to the Council on 14 February.
105.  Mr Straw also said that the aftermath was “being discussed intensively” with
Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, and Mr Geoff Hoon, the
Defence Secretary.
106.  The points made in discussion included:

•	
•	

The use of the word “aftermath” was “ill-chosen: it incorrectly implied that Iraq
would be utterly destroyed by military conflict whereas we should gear our
thinking around the future of the people of Iraq and their interests”.
The reconstruction and development of Iraq would “provide opportunities
for British companies to be involved”.

197

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	
•	
•

•	

The focus after hostilities “had to be on civil society which had suffered 35 years
of tyranny that had reduced the country to the point where 60 percent of the
population relied on United Nations food programmes”.
The US inter-agency process to address Iraq’s redevelopment after any military
action was being led by the Pentagon.
It was “essential” that the UN should be involved in Iraq’s redevelopment after
any military action “to avoid the military coalition being viewed as an army of
occupation”.
The nature of a further resolution “would depend on the circumstances at the
time, but it was likely that there would be a period between the adoption of
a resolution and the start of any military action so that a final ultimatum could
be given for the departure of the current Iraqi regime”.
International consensus in support of military action would “encourage public
support” in the UK.
Some people “did not recognise the lessons we had learned from not
confronting tyranny in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and now Iraq”.
Briefing on the Government’s position on Iraq “should be improved and
disseminated widely; it was clear that colleagues were operating at different
levels of knowledge, and it would be helpful if the best possible information
about the facts were available to enable them to advance the best possible
arguments”.
Parliament would need an opportunity to debate any further UN resolution.

107.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that:
“… Ministers needed to be active with their supporters, both inside and outside
Parliament, to make the case. Briefing material had to be improved so that the
facts were drawn together in a coherent form under various headings: the Iraqi
regime; the United Nations’ involvement; non- compliance by Iraq with the weapons
inspectors; the humanitarian angle, all of which would need to be updated regularly.”
108.  The UK would continue to pursue the UN route. That was “important in respect
of Iraq, but it was also necessary in dealing with a dysfunctional world where a broad
agenda had to be addressed to deal with poverty, the Middle East Peace Process,
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction”.
109.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that:

•	
•	

Mr Blair had “put a pretty optimistic face” on the reports of his meetings with
President Bush and President Chirac.
Mr Robin Cook, then Leader of the House of Commons, had quizzed on the
Parliamentary process.

198

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

•	
•	

Dr John Reid, Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party Chair, “said he was
troubled about the lack of domestic consensus, that there was a sense of people
losing their moral compass about the nature of the Iraqi regime”.
Ms Tessa Jowell, the Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, “didn’t know anyone
under twenty five who supported action and we had to do better at countering
the scepticism”.27

110.  Following Cabinet, Mr Blair asked Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the Joint
Intelligence Committee (JIC), “to provide a confidential and intelligence based briefing
on Iraq for small groups of Ministers attending Cabinet”. The briefing would “take as its
starting point Part 1 of the Government’s dossier published last September” and cover:

•	
•	
•	

the “latest assessment of Iraq’s holding of weapons of mass destruction”;

•	

“Iraq and terrorism”.28

the Iraqi response to resolution 1441;
“recent developments in Iraq and our current assessment of the cohesion
of the regime”;

Four “briefing sessions” were offered the following week.
111.  The content of those briefings is addressed in Section 4.3.

Meetings with Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei, 6 February 2003
112.  In meetings on 6 February, Mr Blair told Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei that he
doubted Saddam Hussein would co-operate. He argued that a second resolution
would provide a basis for mobilising the international community to persuade
Saddam Hussein to leave. A tough line was the best way to avoid conflict.
113.  Mr Straw told Dr ElBaradei that Saddam Hussein would choose exile only
if he thought it was his last chance of survival.
114.  Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC’s next quarterly report, due on 1 March, would
identify “clusters” of issues that could be used to pose sharp questions for Iraq,
possibly as part of an ultimatum.
115.  Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair that the material described as “unaccounted for”
in UNSCOM’s report of 1999 was not necessarily present in Iraq; and that it would
be “paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn out to be very little”.
116.  Dr Blix told Mr Straw he thought Iraq had prohibited programmes, and
it “definitely possessed the ability to jump-start BW programmes”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

117.  Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei met Mr Blair and Mr Straw on 6 February, before a visit
to Baghdad on 8 to 9 February.29
118.  The FCO briefing note stated that:
“Since the Prime Minister last saw Blix on 17 January, he has hardly put a foot
wrong. His statement to the UN Security Council (UNSC) on 27 January was
stronger than many expected: in particular he helpfully made clear that Iraq was
not offering the full and active co-operation that the UNSC expected, and there
were serious unanswered questions, and that Iraq still did not accept that it had
to disarm.”30
119.  In the meeting with Mr Blair, Dr Blix registered a number of questions about
Secretary Powell’s briefing to the Security Council the previous day.31 He also said
that intelligence leads had so far produced only one success.
120.  The record of the meeting stated that Dr Blix:
“… would seek to resolve three relatively minor points related to process:
U2 overflights, interviews, and Iraqi domestic legislation. His approach would be
that the Iraqis had better come up with co-operation on substance … If Saddam
decided to be as helpful on substance as he was on process, fine.”
121.  Mr Blair doubted that Saddam Hussein would co-operate:
“He would try some trick to divide the Security Council. Retaining his WMD was
essential to his own view of his grip on Iraq.”
122.  Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair that: “UNSCOM had not reported that the 1999
left-overs were present in Iraq, just that they were unaccounted for.” UNMOVIC was
more cautious than the UK, but Dr Blix agreed that if Iraq did not have documents it
should be more eager to allow interviews to go ahead. There was a stalemate on the
issue. The inspectors might have to ask for interviews without minders, but Dr Blix was
uneasy about risking people’s lives.
123.  Dr Blix was reported to have informed Mr Blair that his report to the Security
Council on 14 February would probably contain a “balance sheet”. His last assessment
had been “honest but harsh”; the next might have to say that the inspectors “had not
found any WMD”.

124.  Dr Blix suggested that the next quarterly report under resolution 1284, due
on 1 March:
“… might be the moment to set out clear, crisp questions based on the clusters …
If he surfaced those … questions now, Iraq would simply demand six months
to answer them. It would be better to use them as part of an ultimatum …”
125.  In response to a comment by Mr Blair that containment “was not a long term policy,
and sanctions caused misery to the Iraqi people”, Dr Blix “commented that it would
be paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn out to be very little”. Mr Blair
replied that “if Saddam had no or little WMD he should prove it”.
126.  Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, reported that
Sir David Manning had:
“… underlined we were confident of our judgements on Iraq’s CBW. If the inspectors
had difficulty finding it, this was because Saddam was not co-operating.”
127.  In response to a question from Dr Blix about when Saddam Hussein might crack,
Mr Blair:
“… thought the moment of maximum pressure might be after a second resolution
(following a clear Blix report) when the Arab world might encourage Saddam and
his immediate entourage to leave Iraq. The logic was that Iraq was not co-operating;
we should have a second resolution saying he was in breach; and then we should
mobilise the international community to try and get him to leave so that we did not
have to resort to military action. The best way to avoid a conflict would be to take
a very tough line.”
128.  Mr Campbell wrote that Dr Blix felt that Secretary Powell had done well but was
avoiding comment.32 Dr Blix was “pretty cagey” and had “made clear his job was to be
sceptical”. Dr Blix was talking to Iraq about enhanced co-operation and trying to resolve
the issues of anthrax and VX: “On the remnants of old programmes they should be able
to tell us.”
129.  Dr Blix had told Mr Blair that South Africa was sending a delegation to Iraq
to tell them how to give up WMD. The inspectors had been to some of the places
named in the dossier, “and it could be that they had been sanitised, but they found
nothing”. By 14 February, Dr Blix “would be saying they had not found WMD but there
was no real co-operation. He didn’t want to name scientists for interview for fear that
they would be killed.” Dr Blix “felt … 14 February was a little early to report to the
UN [Security Council]”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

130.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair “said he felt Iraq would come up with some
surprise to split the international community, that intelligence showed he would regard
giving up WMD as a total humiliation, and it was essential to his internal grip”.
131.  Mr Campbell commented that Dr Blix “was a lot less bullish than last time and
clearly fed up with the feeling he was being bullied by America”.
132.  In his subsequent meeting with Mr Straw, Dr Blix was reported to have told
Mr Straw that his next report to the Security Council might include what the Iraqis
had not yet proved they did not have, rather than much evidence of what UNMOVIC
had found.33
133.  Dr Blix had clear indications that anthrax had been weaponised and his personal
judgement was that Iraq did have programmes and definitely possessed the ability
to jump-start BW programmes. The trick would be to find evidence.
134.  Dr Blix also told Mr Straw that if the Al Samoud missiles were found to be illegal,
they would be destroyed. That could force a real confrontation with the Iraqis who were
not keen to lose billions of dollars of armaments at a time when they were threatened
with military action.
135.  Dr ElBaradei was reported to have told Mr Straw that he would press Iraq hard on
possible uranium imports and interviews. He did not expect much movement from Iraq
and tough messages from the international community could only help the inspectors.
136.  When Dr ElBaradei raised the possibility of building an option for exile into the
second resolution, Mr Straw responded that Saddam Hussein would “choose exile
(if at all) only if he was convinced that was his only chance of survival”. Mr Straw did
not favour including it in a second resolution. If a strong resolution was passed, there
would be “enough time [for Saddam Hussein] to consider his options” and for “high level
envoys to help him make the right choice”.
137.  Mr Straw encouraged Dr ElBaradei to focus on interviews; the UK had portable
“safe rooms” and could provide them to the IAEA and UNMOVIC if it helped.
Dr ElBaradei reported that the scientists he had interviewed were clearly extremely
nervous, but he saw great difficulties with conducting interviews overseas.
138.  The record of the discussion with Mr Blair reported that Dr ElBaradei thought
opinion was moving towards a second resolution.34

139.  Dr ElBaradei told Mr Blair:
“Not all members agreed with the US timing … Iraq was not co-operating. Unless
there were clear signs of an Iraqi change of heart on co-operation, (both process,
including interviews, and substance), UNSCR 1441 would have to be implemented.
Not allowing interviews was a lack of full co-operation … dribbling out concessions
was not full co-operation … His 14 February report would be a clear as possible.”
140.  In Dr ElBaradei’s view, CBW was the key.
141.  On nuclear issues, the inspectors continued to assess the aluminium tubes.
Reports of the possible import of uranium were: “Much more disturbing … There could
only be one reason for such an import.”
142.  Dr ElBaradei told Mr Blair:
“If satisfactory co-operation was not forthcoming, the next best outcome would
be to force Saddam … out … [He] did not oppose more time for inspections. Any
war would risk radicalising the region. It should be UN-controlled. As should the
future Iraq …”
143.  The No.10 record stated that Mr Blair had made clear to both Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei “the importance of putting Iraqis on the spot with some sharp questions,
to show whether they were co-operating fully or not”. He had “also emphasised the
importance of interviews”.
144.  In Mr Blair’s view: “Our best chance of avoiding war was a clear verdict from the
inspectors followed by a massive international effort to get Saddam to go.”
145.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had told Dr ElBaradei that:
“… we had to sort out Saddam in as peaceful way as possible, but above all sort out
MEPP. Saddam’s duty was one hundred per cent co-operation, not hide and seek …
[I]f there was a breach, there would be second resolution and then we could build
pressure on him to go.”35
146.  Mr Campbell also wrote that Dr ElBaradei:

•	
•	
•	

had said the Iraqis claimed they never tried to get uranium but it wasn’t true;

•	

felt it would be better if Mr Blair and President Bush could say it was part
of a vision of a zone free of nuclear weapons;

did not think many tears would be shed in the Arab world if Saddam went;
was worried that Iraq would claim it was being attacked not because of weapons
but because they were a Muslim country;

said the IAEA strategy was to force Saddam Hussein into co-operation, though
he doubted it was possible;
came back again and again to the theme that American public diplomacy wasn’t
working; and
said we needed intrusive inspections but it could not be done without active
co‑operation.

147.  At the FCO Iraq morning meeting on 7 February, it was reported that Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei had both expressed concern that plans for a second resolution should
factor in the need to allow the weapons inspectors time to get out of Iraq.36

President Bush’s statement, 6 February 2003
148.  In a statement on 6 February, President Bush said that Saddam Hussein was
throwing away his final opportunity to disarm voluntarily.
149.  President Bush reiterated that he would “welcome” a second resolution,
as he stated in the press conference with Mr Blair on 31 January, “which made
clear the Security Council stands behind its previous demands”.
150.  The “game” was “over” and the US was resolved to take whatever action
was necessary to defend itself and to disarm the Iraqi regime.
151.  On 5 February, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed President Bush’s
statement and the possibility that he might “lean forward” on a second resolution.37
President Bush would not seek a second resolution for its own sake, but he was open
to one if others wanted it.
152.  In a statement on 6 February, President Bush emphasised the challenges of
uncovering secret information in a totalitarian society.38 He stated that Iraqi violations
of Security Council resolutions were “evident, and they continue to this hour”.
The Iraqi regime had “never accounted for a vast arsenal of deadly biological and
chemical weapons” and it was “pursuing an elaborate campaign to conceal its weapons
materiels, and to hide or intimidate key experts and scientists”, directed “from the very
highest levels”.
153.  President Bush set out examples of Iraq’s violations, including:

•	

“Firsthand witnesses have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile
factories for the production of biological agents” that “could produce within just
months hundreds of pounds of biological poisons”.

•	
•	

The possibility of unmanned aerial vehicles with spray tanks for biological agents
being “launched from a vessel off the American coast” which “could reach
hundreds of miles inland”.
Iraq might pass weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, had “provided
Al Qaida with chemical and biological weapons training”, and was “harbouring
a terrorist network, headed by a senior Al Qaida terrorist planner”. That network
ran “a poison and explosive training center in northeast Iraq”, was “responsible
for the murder … of an American diplomat”, and “was caught producing poisons
in London”.

154.  President Bush stated that resolution 1441 had given Saddam Hussein a final
chance, and that he was “throwing that chance away”. Having made its demands, the
Security Council “must not back down, when those demands are defied and mocked
by a dictator”.
155.  Referring to a second resolution, President Bush stated:
“The United States would welcome and support a resolution which makes clear that
the Security Council stands behind its previous demands. Yet resolutions mean little
without resolve. And the United States, along with a growing coalition of nations,
is resolved to take whatever action is necessary to defend ourselves and disarm
the Iraqi regime.
“… We will not wait to see what terrorists and terrorist states could do with chemical,
biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein can now be expected
to begin another round of empty concessions, transparently false denials. No doubt,
he will play a last-minute game of deception. The game is over.
“All the world can rise to this moment … The United Nations can renew its purpose
and be a source of stability and security in the world. The Security Council can affirm
that it is able and prepared to meet future challenges … And we can give the Iraqi
people their chance to live in freedom and choose their own government.
“… Saddam Hussein has the motive and the means and the recklessness and
hatred to threaten the American people. Saddam Hussein will be stopped.”

Mr Blair’s interview on Newsnight, 6 February 2003
156.  In his interview on Newsnight on 6 February 2003, Mr Blair said that the UK
would act without a second resolution only if the inspectors reported that they
could not do their job and a resolution was vetoed unreasonably.
157.  Mr Blair also stated that the UK would not take military action without
a majority in the Security Council.

205

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

158.  Mr Blair gave an extended interview about Iraq and public services
on BBC Television’s Newsnight on 6 February.39
159.  During the interview Mr Jeremy Paxman challenged Mr Blair on a number
of issues, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

whether Iraq posed a clear and imminent danger to the UK or was a potential
future threat;
what had changed since Mr Blair had stated in November 2000 that Saddam
Hussein was being effectively contained;
that the inspectors had not been “thrown out” of Iraq in 1998, but had withdrawn;
whether, if the inspectors were present in Iraq, it would be “impossible for
Saddam Hussein to continue developing weapons of mass destruction”;
what evidence there was of Iraqi concealment;
how much time and space the inspectors needed to do their job;
whether Mr Blair would “give an undertaking” that he would “seek another
UN resolution specifically authorising the use of force”;
the absence of links between Baghdad and Al Qaida; and
why action against Iraq was the priority, not other states with WMD.

160.  The key elements of Mr Blair’s responses to Mr Paxman and related questions
from a panel of voters are set out below.
161.  Explaining his position on a second resolution, Mr Blair stated that “the only
circumstances in which we would agree to use force” would be with a further resolution
“except for one caveat”. That was:
“If the inspectors do report that they can’t do their work properly because Iraq is not
co-operating there’s no doubt that under the terms of the existing United Nations
resolution that that’s a breach of the resolution. In those circumstances there should
be a further resolution.
“… If a country unreasonably in those circumstances put down a veto then I would
consider action outside of that.”
162.  Pressed whether he considered he was “absolutely free to defy the express will
of the Security Council”, Mr Blair responded that he could not “just do it with America”,
there would have to be “a majority in the Security Council”:
“[The] issue of a veto doesn’t even arise unless you get a majority in the Security
Council. Secondly, the choice … is … If the will of the UN is the thing that is
most important and I agree that it is, if there is a breach of resolution 1441… and
we do nothing then we have flouted the will of the UN.”

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

163.  Asked if he was saying that there was already an authorisation for war,
Mr Blair responded:
“No, what I am saying is … In the resolution [1441] … we said that Iraq … had …
a final opportunity to comply.
“The duty of compliance was defined as full co-operation with the UN inspectors.
The resolution … say[s] any failure to co-operate fully is a breach of this resolution
and serious consequences i.e. action, would follow … [W]e then also put in that
resolution that there will be a further discussion in the Security Council. But the clear
understanding was that if the inspectors say that Iraq is not complying and there
is a breach … then we have to act.
“… if someone … says … I accept there’s a breach … but I’m issuing a veto
I think that would be unreasonable … I don’t think that’s what will happen. I think
that … if the inspectors do end up in a situation where they’re saying there is not
compliance by Iraq, then I think a second resolution will issue.”
164.  Asked whether he agreed it was “important to get France, Russia and Germany
on board”, Mr Blair replied, “Yes … That’s what I am trying to get.”
165.  Asked if he would “give an undertaking that he wouldn’t go to war without their
agreement”, Mr Blair replied:
“… supposing in circumstances where there plainly was breach … and everyone
else wished to take action, one of them put down a veto. In those circumstances it
would be unreasonable.
“Then I think it [not to act] would be wrong because otherwise you couldn’t uphold
the UN. Because you would have passed your resolution and then you’d have failed
to act on it.”
166.  Asked whether it was for the UK to judge what was “unreasonable”, Mr Blair
envisaged that would be in circumstances where the inspectors, not the UK, had
reported to the Council that they could not do their job.
167.  Asked if the US and UK went ahead without a UN resolution would any other
country listen to the UN in the future, Mr Blair replied that there was “only one set of
circumstances” in which that would happen. Resolution 1441 “effectively” said that if the
inspectors said they could not do their job, a second resolution would issue: “If someone
then … vetoes wrongly, what do we do?”

207

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

THE UK’S POSITION, 7 FEBRUARY 2003
168.  The FCO sent guidance on “key UN aspects” of the UK’s policy on Iraq
to diplomatic posts on 7 February.40 Extracts from the guidance are summarised
in the Box below.

FCO guidance on the UK’s position, 7 February 2003
Can anyone launch military action without a further Security Council resolution?

•	

Mr Straw had said that, if there was a material breach, the Government’s
preference was for a second resolution. So far the Security Council had “faced
up to its responsibilities”. The UK believed it would continue to do so, but had to
“reserve our position in the event it does not”.

•	

Any failure by Iraq to comply would have serious consequences. The action
necessary to bring Iraq into compliance would “depend on the circumstances
at the time”.

Does Iraq’s declaration of 7 December mean that Iraq is co-operating?

•	

The declaration did not contain “any new evidence that would eliminate the
outstanding disarmament questions or reduce their number”; and it was “not the
full and complete declaration required by resolution 1441”.

•	

Mr Straw had published a list of “10 outstanding questions, identified by Dr Blix,
that Iraq must answer”.41

•	

“Saddam and his officials would do well to remember that concealment is not
compliance. Only declarations supported by evidence will give confidence in
a country with such a long history … of avoiding disclosures.”

Is Iraq co-operating with inspectors?

•	

Dr Blix’s update of 27 January had “highlighted a number of instances of Iraqi
non-co-operation …: failing to answer outstanding issues, identified by UNSCOM;
obstructing U2 reconnaissance flights; hindering interviews; some instances of
harassment of the inspectors”.

Is Iraq in material breach?

40 
41 

•	

Resolution 1441 was clear: “false statements or omissions in the declaration and
failure to co-operate fully with the inspectors shall constitute a further material
breach of Iraq’s obligations”.

•	

Mr Straw had made clear “Iraq has failed both tests”. The “inescapable
conclusion” was that Iraq was “now in material breach”. War was “not inevitable.
But the responsibility to avoid conflict rests with Saddam Hussein.”

The National Archives, 28 January 2003, Iraq is in Material Breach of Resolution 1441.

208

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

Did Mr Straw’s judgement that Iraq is in material breach mean the UK is taking the
issue to the Council under paragraph 4 of the resolution and “going for a second
resolution authorising military action”?

•	

“The Council, through its meetings last week, and in future meetings such
as those scheduled for 5 and 14 February, is continuously assessing Iraq’s
compliance.”

•	

“Resolution 1441 warned that Iraq would face ‘serious consequences’ if it failed
to comply. We expect the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities.”

How much time is left?

•	

“It is not a matter of time it is a matter of attitude. And the attitude we’re getting
from the Iraqis at the moment is just not sufficient for the eradication of the
programmes we know about.”

What chance is there of Security Council agreement to authorise the use of force?

•	

The unanimous adoption of resolution 1441 showed the “clear determination” of
the Council to ensure Iraq fulfilled its obligations; it was “the toughest resolution
on Iraq for years. Iraqis and others should be in no doubt that members of the
Council are determined to ensure its implementation.”

UNMOVIC’s powers/chances of success?

•	
•	

The UK Government was “committed” to giving UNMOVIC the necessary support.

•	

“Inspectors are not meant to be detectives. While they will verify the accuracy,
completeness and credibility of Iraq’s declarations, the onus is on Iraq to show
they have no WMD. It is up to them to co-operate … and to demonstrate to the
international community they that they are committed to eliminating the threat
of WMD …”

Iraq was “concealing WMD programmes … including through the use of mobile
facilities and hindering inspectors’ efforts to interview personnel”.

Timetable?

•	
•	

Iraq had submitted its declaration by the deadline required.
Inspections had started on 27 November, “ahead of the 23 December deadline
required by resolution 1441” and Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had updated the
Council 60 days later. They had offered another update on 14 February.

Mr Annan’s speech, 8 February 2003
169.  In a speech on 8 February, Mr Annan stated that Iraq had not yet satisfied
the Security Council that it had fully disarmed, and that success in getting Iraq to
disarm by inspections would be a great prize.
170.  Mr Annan also stated that the United Nations had a duty to exhaust all the
possibilities for a peaceful settlement before resorting to the use of force; but if
that time came the Council “must face up to its responsibilities”.

209

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

171.  Mr Annan called for unity and warned of the consequences of the use of
force without the legitimacy provided by the Security Council.
172.  In a speech in Williamsburg, Virginia, on 8 February 2003, Mr Annan addressed
the “anxiety, in this country and throughout the world about the prospect of war in Iraq”.42
He stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	

•

•	
•

•	

The UN had been founded “to save succeeding generations from the scourge
of war”, which “We all – and, first and foremost, the leaders of Iraq itself – have
a duty to prevent it if we possibly can.”
But “there would be times when force must be met with force”; and there were
provisions in the UN Charter “to enable the world community to unite against
aggression and defeat it”.
Iraq had “not yet satisfied the Security Council that it has fully disarmed itself
of weapons of mass destruction”.
That was “an issue not for any State alone, but for the international community
as a whole. When States decide to use force, not in self-defence but to deal with
broader threats to international peace and security, there is no substitute for the
unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations Security Council. States and
peoples around the world attach fundamental importance to such legitimacy,
and to the international rule of law.”
It was “vitally important” that the whole international community acted in a
“united way – so as to achieve greater security by strengthening, and not
weakening or undermining, the multilateral treaties on disarmament and nonproliferation. Only a collective, multilateral approach can effectively curb the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and make the world a safer place.”
The UN had “the duty to exhaust all the possibilities of peaceful settlement,
before resorting to the use of force”.
It was “thanks in large part to the firm challenge issued by President Bush – and
the pressure that followed it – that the inspectors are back in Iraq”.
There was “total unanimity” that “Iraq must disarm, and must do so pro-actively”.
Success in getting Iraq to disarm “by effective and credible inspections” would
be a great prize.
If Iraq failed to make use of the “last chance” provided in resolution 1441, and
continued its defiance, the Council would “have to make another grim choice,
based on the findings of the inspectors … And when that time comes, the
Council must face up to its responsibilities.”
In his experience, the Council met its responsibilities “best and most effectively
when its members work in unison. The Council should proceed in a determined,
reflective and deliberate manner. Its measures must be seen as firm, effective,

credible and reasonable not only by the Council members, but by the public
at large.”
What happened in Iraq would “not take place in a vacuum”; it had “implications
– for better or worse – for other issues of great importance to the US and
to the world. For instance, it will greatly affect the climate in which we conduct
our struggle against international terrorism.”
The UN and the US were successful when there was “strong US leadership,
exercised through patient diplomatic persuasion and coalition-building”. The UN
was “most useful to all its Members, including the US” when it was “united, and
works as a source of collective action rather than discord”.

Discussions in Baghdad, 8 to 9 February 2003
Dr Blix’s account of the discussions in Baghdad on 8 and 9 February recorded that they
had been “professional and had shed some new light, but had not really brought any new
evidence”.43 He and Dr ElBaradei had been given new assurances that people would
be “encourage[d]” to provide interviews without minders or recording equipment and the
mandate for the special commission appointed to search for any remaining chemical
weapons was extended to cover any prohibited items, but the questions about U-2 flights
remained unresolved until shortly after the visit.
Dr Blix concluded that they “had obtained much less than we felt was needed” but their
“overall impression” had been that the Iraqis were genuinely rattled”. The Iraqis continued
to do “too little, too late”.
Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei reported the discussion to the Security Council on 14 February.

The impact of military action on the terrorist threat to the UK
173.  The Security Service warned on 6 February that Al Qaida would use an attack
on Iraq to step up activity in the UK.
174.  Mr Blair had a meeting with Mr Hoon, Mr Straw, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (Chief
of the Defence Staff (CDS)), Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of the Secret Intelligence
Service (SIS)), Ms Eliza Manningham-Buller (Director General of the Security Service),
Mr Scarlett, Air Commodore Mike Heath (Head of the MOD Directorate of Targeting
and Information Operations), and No.10 officials on 6 February, during which he was
briefed on the targeting aspects of an air campaign, for his meetings with Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei, and on the terrorist threats to UK interests.44
175.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] reported that Blix was making clear there could be no
aggressive inspections in mosques and cemeteries. He also said that no serious
interviews had taken place at all because there had been so much intimidation.

“Eliza [Manningham-Buller] gave a very gloomy picture of the terrorist scene here,
said that even though Al Qaida were not directly linked to Iraq, they would use
an attack on Iraq to step up activity here. TB [Mr Blair] was looking really worried
at that point.”45
176.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair had “said he had no doubt that trying to
remove Saddam quickly in the event of action was the best way, but he wanted to
know what he was in for”. C and Mr Scarlett had “said that there were suggestions that
the Republican Guard were to be kept out of Baghdad because Saddam didn’t trust

JIC ASSESSMENTS, 10 AND 19 FEBRUARY 2003
177.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment of 10 February reiterated
earlier warnings, described in Section 3.5, that:

•	
•	

Al Qaida and associated networks would remain the greatest terrorist
threat to the UK and its activity would increase at the onset of any military
action against Iraq.
In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological
material could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida.

178.  At the request of the MOD and the FCO, on 10 February the JIC assessed
“broader terrorist activity that would be triggered by war with Iraq”.46
179.  The JIC’s Key Judgements were:
“•	 The threat from Al Qaida will increase at the onset of any military action
against Iraq. They will target Coalition forces and other Western interests in
the Middle East. Attacks against Western interests elsewhere are also likely,
especially in the US and UK, for maximum impact. The worldwide threat from
other Islamist terrorist groups and individuals will increase significantly.

•	

•	

Al Qaida associates and sympathisers may well attempt chemical or biological
terrorist attacks in the Gulf, including against UK civilian targets there, in the
event of war with Iraq. While individual attacks are likely to be small-scale they
may be numerous. Individual attacks might inflict relatively few casualties, but
will cause significant alarm.
Al Qaida associated terrorists in Iraq and in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone
in Northern Iraq could conduct attacks against Coalition forces and interests
during, or in the aftermath of, war with Iraq. But Al Qaida will not carry out
attacks under Iraqi direction.

•	
•	
•	
•	

Saddam’s own capability to conduct terrorist attacks is limited, especially
outside the Middle East. But the threat of terrorism conducted or directed by
Iraqi Intelligence, including the use of chemical or biological material, cannot
be discounted.
In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material
could be transferred to terrorists including Al Qaida, whether or not as deliberate
regime policy.
Al Qaida and associated networks will remain the greatest terrorist threat to the
UK. The risk of attacks will increase following any Coalition attack on Iraq.
Hizballah’s terrorist wing will not conduct attacks in support of Saddam. But
it may attack US forces in Iraq following a campaign, if it judges that the US
intends to act against Hizballah, Syria or Iran. […] Individual Palestinian
terrorists may attack Western interests, without sanction from parent groups.”

180.  Other key elements from the Assessment are set out in the Box below.

JIC Assessment, 10 February 2003:
‘International Terrorism: War with Iraq’
Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists

•	

There was “continuing determination by Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists
to attack Western interests around the globe”.

•	

The JIC had “previously judged that Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists may
initiate attacks in response to Coalition military action against Iraq, and that Al
Qaida will use an attack on Iraq as further justification for terrorist attacks in the
West and Israel”.

•	

Some reports indicated that Usama Bin Laden had “instructed that there should
be no terrorist attacks before the start of a conflict”.

•	

Al Qaida intended “to exploit both anti-Western sentiment within the Muslim world,
and the preoccupation of the US and UK that would come from action against Iraq”.

•	

Al Qaida or associated groups might “also seek to conduct attacks against Israel,
intended to provoke a reaction that would further inflame feeling within the Islamic
world”.

•	

The JIC believed that Islamist terrorists had manufactured and stockpiled
chemical and biological (CB) material intended for attacks against both UK
and US targets in the Gulf, and that: “Instructions for production of similar CB
materials” had been “distributed by Gulf-based terrorists to extremists”.

•	

The JIC had “some doubts about the viability of the proposed attack
methods”, but judged there was “a serious intention to use CB weapons”.

•	

“Even if successful, individual attacks might inflict relatively few casualties.
But attacks could be numerous and cause significant alarm.”

•	

The use of CB materials was “an increasing aspiration of Islamic extremists
globally, including in Europe”.

•	

“Such material may be manufactured locally or provided by production facilities
such as that operating in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) in Northern Iraq.”

213

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

There was “no intelligence” that Iraq had “provided CB materials to Al Qaida”.

•	

The JIC also judged that Al Qaida retained “its long-standing interest in acquiring
a nuclear device”, but had “no convincing intelligence that it has done so”.

The JIC continued “to judge that in the event of imminent regime collapse
there would be a risk of transfer of such material, whether or not as
deliberate Iraqi regime policy”.

Al Qaida in Iraq

•	

There was “no intelligence” to suggest that Al Qaida planned to carry out attacks
under Iraqi direction.

•	

Intelligence showed “the presence of Al Qaida associated extremists in
Baghdad. […] We do not know what the current presence is, its purpose, or what
relationship it has to Saddam’s regime, if any.”

•	

The JIC judged that it was “unlikely that the Iraqi regime” were “unaware” of the
Al Qaida presence but it did not know whether those terrorists planned to conduct
activities in or from Iraq.

•	

Intelligence suggested “the presence of […] Al Qaida-linked terrorists in North
Eastern Iraq, in the KAZ, with safe haven provided by Ansar al-Islam, an Al Qaidaassociated extremist group”.

•	

“Some of these individuals” were “involved in production and distribution
of CB materials”.

•	
•	

Intelligence showed that extremists continued to arrive in the region.
The terrorists might “re-locate in the event of imminent Coalition action” but
“equally they could conduct terrorist activities (including possible use of CB
materials) or guerrilla actions against Coalition forces in Iraq”.

Iraqi terrorism

•	

The JIC had previously judged that Saddam Hussein “would aspire to conduct
terrorist attacks against Coalition interests in the event of military action against
him, or possibly if he believed an attack was inevitable”.

•	

Authoritative reporting suggested that “Iraqi Intelligence (DGI) has little reach
or capability outside Iraq”.

•	

The JIC had “no intelligence of Iraqi intentions to conduct CB terrorist attacks
using DGI or its agents; but such activity remains a possibility”.

•	

Iraqi plans for terrorist activity in the event of conflict would be:
“… dependent on individual operatives’ willingness to implement them, which
will be in doubt if they perceive regime change to be certain. But the threat
from terrorism conducted or directed by DGI cannot be discounted.”

181.  Addressing the prospects for the future, the JIC Assessment concluded:
“Despite a significant body of intelligence on Iraq’s preparations to conduct
terrorism against Western interests, […], we have seen no persuasive evidence
that these efforts will be effective. Al Qaida and associated groups will continue
to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that

214

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

threat will be heightened by military action against Iraq. The broader threat from
Islamist terrorists will also increase in the event of war, reflecting intensified anti-US/
anti-Western sentiment in the Muslim world, including among Muslim communities
in the West. And there is a risk that the transfer of CB material or expertise, during
or in the aftermath of conflict, will enhance Al Qaida’s capabilities.”
182.  On 11 February, Usama Bin Laden issued a call for Muslims everywhere to take
up arms in defence of Iraq.47 That was followed on 16 February by a call for “compulsory
jihad” by Muslims against the West.
183.  A Security Service report in February 2003 concluded:
“Iraq is unlikely to use terrorism to attack the worldwide interests of the US and
its allies prior to military action.”48
184.  A further JIC Assessment on 19 February predicted that the upward trend
in the reports of threats to the UK was likely to continue.
185.  On 19 February, the JIC updated the December 2002 Assessment of the
continuing threat posed by Al Qaida and associated extremists, including to the UK.49
186.  The JIC’s Key Judgements were that:
“•	 A high impact, spectacular, attack is a priority for Al Qaida, most likely against
American or British interests in the Gulf, US or UK. Al Qaida will also seek to
conduct frequent, perhaps multiple, small-scale attacks.

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The threat from Islamist terrorists, including Al Qaida, will increase in the event
of war with Iraq.
Attacks in the UK could include use of chemical and biological agents, probably
on a small-scale (though potentially causing significant alarm). But conventional
attacks remain more likely. UK interests are now on a par with US targets for
some Islamist terrorists, although the US is likely to remain the priority for most.
Both large and small-scale attacks overseas could include use of chemical,
biological (or radiological) materials.
Bin Laden’s 11 February statement is probably linked to Al Qaida’s intent
to attack Coalition targets in the event of war with Iraq, rather than intended
to trigger attacks before then.
There are differences within the leadership of Al Qaida over strategy, although
these do not so far appear to indicate any diminution of the threat.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

187.  Other key elements from the Assessment were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

There were suggestions that UK interests were “on a par with US targets
for some Islamist terrorists” although it was “likely that the US” would “remain
the priority for most”.
The threat of a “conventional’ attack” in the UK remained “a major concern”.
The “threat of CB attacks in the UK” remained; they “would probably be
small-scale (but potentially high impact)”.
There had been “a particularly high number of threat reports” during the previous
“two months”, although “only a small proportion” would “materialise into terrorist
action”.
The “upward trend” was “likely to continue” as a possible conflict with Iraq
approached.
Usama Bin Laden’s statement of 11 February was “unlikely to be the trigger
for attacks by Islamist extremists”, although it would “enable him to take credit
for attacks conducted in response to a war with Iraq”.

188.  An update of the 10 February Assessment, of terrorist activity which would
be triggered by military action in Iraq, was produced by the JIC on 12 March.50 That
is addressed in Section 3.8.

UK consideration of the timing and tactics for a second resolution
189.  The FCO advised No.10 on 10 February that only four votes in the Security
Council could be counted on for a second resolution. It would be impossible
to obtain support for a resolution explicitly authorising the use of “all necessary
means” to disarm Iraq.
190.  The key element in the resolution would be a sufficient link to resolution
1441 to establish that the Security Council has concluded that Iraq had failed
to take its final opportunity.
191.  The FCO identified three options and planned to discuss the approach with
the US before tabling a draft resolution following Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei’s report
to the Security Council on 14 February.
192.  On 7 February, Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, reported to Mr Straw
that the UK’s strategy on Iraq was approaching “the critical phase”.51 Sir Jeremy
Greenstock had advised that here was “no prospect” of getting an explicit “all necessary
means” provision in a resolution. Lord Goldsmith had been consulted about more
implicit options.

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

193.  Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw that possible elements for a resolution included
an ultimatum (to allow the possibility of persuading Saddam Hussein to leave to be
explored) and a possible reference to a further resolution authorising post-conflict work.
194.  Mr Ricketts suggested that the right channel for discussing text with the US
would be through the UN Missions in New York, and highlighted the need for an
intensive campaign, in close co-ordination with the US, to lobby other members
of the Security Council.
195.  Mr Straw endorsed the recommendations.52
196.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had reassured Mr Annan that it was
unlikely that the UK would circulate a draft resolution the following week.53 There were
likely to be difficulties in the Council.
197.  In a discussion with Ambassador John Negroponte, US Permanent Representative
to the UN, Sir Jeremy had emphasised the importance of a draft which “helped bring
people on board”. That would determine whether to include an ultimatum and whether
to mention “serious consequences” or “all necessary means”.
198.  Mr Straw’s Private Office forwarded advice on the timings and tactics for a second
resolution to Sir David Manning on 10 February.54
199.  The FCO advised:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Only four votes in the Security Council (the US, UK, Bulgaria and Spain) could
be “counted on” for a second resolution.
Russia, Chile and Pakistan could be “moving in our direction” and China also
seemed “to be moving away from a veto”.
France, Germany and Syria remained “strongly opposed” and Mexico was
“highly sceptical”. The position of France and President Chirac was described
as “heavily dependent on strength of evidence”.
Guinea, Cameroon and Angola might be “coming round to supporting a second
resolution but needed working on”.

200.  The FCO provided a more detailed matrix summarising the positions of the UN
Security Council members with proposals for further lobbying by the UK and others, but
concluded that “without more dramatic evidence of Iraqi non-compliance, most members
of the UNSC will remain non-committal”.
201.  On the text of a second resolution, the FCO advised that it would be “impossible
to obtain support for a second resolution explicitly authorising ‘all necessary means’”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

202.  The FCO identified three options which, it believed, met the legal requirements
and reflected Lord Goldsmith’s advice, that “the key element of any resolution would
be a sufficient link back [to] resolution 1441, to establish that the [Security] Council has
concluded that Iraq has failed to take its ‘final opportunity’”.
203.  All three options included a first operative paragraph (OP) stating that the Security
Council decided that:
“Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it in resolution 1441 (2002) by
submitting a declaration pursuant to that resolution containing [false statements and]
omissions and by failing to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation
of, that resolution”.
204.  The options also included a final OP determining that the Council had decided
“to remain seized of the matter”.
205.  The difference between the three options was whether to include an additional
OP containing an “ultimatum”, “couched in general terms”.
206.  To avoid the risk of opening up the debate about whether a further determination
that Iraq had failed to comply with the ultimatum was needed from the Security Council,
the FCO proposed “a formula which would, in effect, authorise action against Iraq unless
the Council took the decision that Iraq had decided to come into compliance”.
207.  The FCO draft proposed: “unless … the Council concludes before 5 March that the
Government of Iraq has taken an unconditional and irreversible decision [at the highest
levels] to come into compliance with its obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and
previous relevant resolutions” either:

•	
•	

“the final opportunity granted to Iraq in resolution 1441 (2002) will expire on
5 March 2003”; or
“Iraq will face the serious consequences it has been repeatedly warned of,
including in paragraph 13 of resolution 1441 (2202)”.

208.  The draft provided for the decision to be “based on” reports from Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei.
209.  The FCO explained that it was:
“… possible to imagine more explicit options, particularly those which include an
explicit finding that Iraq is in ‘material breach’. This would not be strictly necessary
from a legal point of view. But, as a matter of tactics, we will need to consider with
the Americans whether we should start with a more ambitious text …”

218

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

210.  The FCO aim was to agree the text and tactics with the US in New York “in the
course of next week”, but not to “float” the ideas with other Council members until after
Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 14 February, although that might depend
on events.
211.  Copies of the letter were sent to Lord Goldsmith and to Mr Hoon’s Private Office
as well as to Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Christopher Meyer.
212.  Lord Goldsmith’s advice, that the key element of a second resolution would be the
provision of a sufficient link back to resolution 1441 to establish that the Security Council
had concluded Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity to disarm provided by the
resolution,55 is addressed in Section 5.

Tripartite declaration, 10 February 2003
213.  Der Spiegel published an article on 10 February, entitled The Mirage Project,
reporting that French and German officials had been holding secret talks aimed at
installing a disarmament regime in Iraq monitored by aircraft patrolling Iraqi airspace
and “thousands” of armed UN peacekeepers to “secure a victory without bullets”.56
214.  Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, sent a translation of the article
to Mr Blair suggesting that the UK needed to produce an ultimatum in a UN resolution
along the lines that:

•	
•	

Iraq was not co-operating or disarming.

•	

Iraq would face serious consequences if by 28 February it did not accept and
begin full implementation of the following steps:

The international community intended to ensure that resolution 1441 was
“implemented in full”.

{{ a

“No-Fly Zone covering the whole country”, patrolled by international
aircraft;

{{ an

international ground force to “enforce disarmament”, comprising
an “international coalition of the willing headed by a British general with
approx 40,000 troops”;

{{ a

“UN mandate for governance of Iraq while the international force is there
making Iraq a UN protectorate under a UN permanent co-ordinator”; and

{{ establishment

of a “special UN court of justice” to “punish infringements
of the resolutions and human rights infringements”.57

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

215.  France, Germany and Russia issued a tripartite declaration on 10 February,
reaffirming the objective of disarming Iraq as soon as possible but stating that
potential of resolution 1441 for peaceful disarmament had not yet been fully
explored.
216.  Sir John Holmes described the declaration as “a symbolic act” which
was “significant”.
217.  In a press conference in Paris on 10 February, President Chirac and President
Putin issued a tripartite declaration on behalf of the Governments of France, Germany
and Russia which stressed the alternatives to the use of force, and the need to give
peaceful disarmament every opportunity.58
218.  The main points of the declaration were:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Reaffirmation that disarmament of Iraq in accordance with a series of resolutions
following resolution 687 (1991) remained the common aim of the international
community and must be achieved as soon as possible.
The solution “must be inspired” by the principles of the UN Charter as stated
recently by Mr Annan in his speech of 8 February.
Resolution 1441 (2002) offered a framework but its “possibilities” had “not yet
been fully explored”.
Inspections had “already yielded results”.
The three countries favoured “the continuation of the inspections and the
substantial strengthening of their human and technical capacities by all possible
means”.
There was “still an alternative to war”.
The use of force could “only be considered as a last resort”.
The three countries were “determined to give every chance to the peaceful
disarmament of Iraq”.
Iraq had to “co-operate actively” with the inspectors and “face up to its
responsibilities in full”.
The position expressed reflected that “of a large number of countries, particularly
within the Security Council”.

219.  Sir John Holmes, told the Inquiry that the tripartite declaration was: “a symbolic act
… to say something very different from what we and others were saying at the time”,
which “was, of course, significant”.59

220.  The British Embassy Moscow reported on 13 February that, during the visit to
France, President Putin had said “so far we see no need to exercise our right of veto”;
and it was also reported that he had then said that “with France or alone”, Russia would
veto an “unreasonable use of force”.60 He had described the tripartite declaration as
“the first attempt since the Second World War to settle a serious and acute international
issue outside the regime of blocs”; and “if we want the world to be more predictable, and
easier to forecast, and therefore a safer place, it should be a multipolar world”.
221.  The Embassy also reported that, referring to the veto in a subsequent conversation
with journalists in Bordeaux, President Putin had said: “We have used this right more
than once, and we can do it again.” He had also warned against “fuelling controversy
over this issue”, and stressed that “Russia will never return to the state of conflict with
its partners either in Europe or North America.”
222.  The Embassy commented that President Putin’s remarks in France had “had a
harder edge to them. But this is probably in part a negotiating tactic in advance of the
series of key events … over the next few days; and in part a desire to please his host.”
The French Embassy in Moscow continued to “believe that Russia would not veto”
a second resolution.

The US position, 10 and 11 February 2003
223.  After consultations in New York on 10 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
reported that the US priority was to “pour cold water” on the tripartite proposals.
224.  The US was “very hesitant” about the UK’s ideas for an ultimatum.
225.  Following discussions in New York on 10 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
reported that the US had agreed there should be no action in the Security Council
until after 14 February; the immediate priority was “to pour cold water on the latest
Franco-German ideas”.61
226.  Sir Jeremy also reported that France had written to Dr Blix to expand its ideas
for strengthening the inspection regime, drawing on the tripartite declaration, but had
declined to share the text until Dr Blix had responded.
227.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the US was “still very hesitant about any
variant of the ultimatum”, because it would give the Security Council a second chance
to consider whether the ultimatum had been implemented. By putting the onus on the
reports of the inspectors, it could also give them an effective veto. Sir Jeremy had
informed Ambassador Negroponte that the UK needed “a second stage of Council
action beyond 1441, and a determination, even implicit, of material breach. After further

discussion, Negroponte had “conceded the possibility of issuing an ultimatum provided
that we had the lock in our favour”.
228.  Separately, Sir Jeremy Greenstock provided a revised draft resolution.62 The draft,
which had been agreed with the US, recalled the provisions of previous resolutions
including resolution 1441 and, anticipating the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei
on 14 February, added a draft preambular paragraph (PP) suggesting that the Security
Council was “Deeply concerned” that the reports had “made clear” that Iraq had “not
co‑operated fully with inspections nor addressed deficiencies in the declaration”
submitted pursuant to resolution 1441.
229.  The draft resolution proposed that the Security Council should decide that “Iraq’s
submission of a declaration containing false statements and omissions and continuing
failure to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of, resolution 1441
(2002)” constituted “a further material breach of Iraq’s obligations under relevant
resolutions of the Council and that Iraq accordingly has failed to take the final
opportunity afforded to it by the Council in resolution 1441 (2002)”.
230.  The draft did not contain a deadline, but stated that “Iraq alone” was “fully
responsible for the serious consequences it must now face as a result of its continued
violations of its obligations under the resolutions of the Council”; and that the Council
had decided “to remain seized of the matter”.
231.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that President Bush would not tolerate
another two months of negotiations. Washington was getting ready for war
in mid- to late March, although it did not want to act alone.
232.  In preparation for a visit to Washington by Mr Hoon (see Section 6.2),
Sir Christopher Meyer advised overnight on 10/11 February that: “Washington is getting
ready for war.”63
233.  Sir Christopher wrote:
“For the Administration and the Hill the time has come to go to war. Powell’s
presentation to the UNSC has boosted public support for war, including support
for action without UN approval, provided that some Allies join in. In Congress it
has silenced most of those who were asking for more evidence. The cautious
multilateralists of both parties now accept that the case has been made …
“The Administration would go to war without a further UNSCR, but knows that
others need one. For the time being Bush is following the UN route and has said
publicly that he would support a second resolution. But he will not tolerate another
two months’ negotiation. Everything points towards early action, possibly by

mid- to late March. The military will be fully in place, and, the White House believes,
political support, both domestically and within the region, will wane, the longer Bush
is seen to prevaricate.”
234.  Sir Christopher commented that the US Administration considered that Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei’s visit to Baghdad had achieved “next to nothing”. It knew:
“… full well that some in the UNSC will seize on the faintest glimmer of hope of Iraqi
co-operation as a reason to delay decisions. The US bottom line remains full Iraqi
co-operation …”
235.  Sir Christopher also commented:
“Although militarily capable of doing so, the US does not want to go it alone. On the
Sunday talk shows, Powell and Rice highlighted the support of eighteen European
allies and of Turkey and Jordan …”
236.  Referring to the “shenanigans in NATO over precautionary planning for the defence
of Turkey”, Sir Christopher added:
“These tussles with the international system will only deepen US scepticism about
a role for the UN in managing the aftermath in Iraq.”
237.  Mr Blair suggested to President Bush on 11 February that a second
resolution might include a decision that Iraq was in material breach, an ultimatum
that Saddam should leave, and a timeline.
238.  When he telephoned President Bush on 11 February, Mr Blair discussed opinions
in the UK and international community, including the reports of a Franco-German “plan”
which had appeared in Der Spiegel and the forthcoming European Council.64
239.  Mr Blair suggested that a second resolution might include three main points:

•	
•	
•	

a decision that Iraq was in material breach of UNSCR 1441;
an ultimatum that Saddam should leave; and
a timeline.

Even if the ultimatum failed, it would show that the UK had been prepared to resolve
the issue peacefully right to the end.
240.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the need for US action if a second
resolution was to be achieved.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

241.  Mr Campbell wrote that, during the telephone call, President Bush had been “very
solicitous” about Mr Blair’s political position and had “said he was determined to help”
get a second resolution.65
242.  The record of the discussion confirms Mr Campbell’s comment.66
243.  Mr Campbell also wrote that President Bush had been “livid with the French and
Germans, less so with the Russians.67 But he was just as worried as TB was.” Mr Blair
“said the problem was everyone accepted Saddam was bad, evil, and a threat, but they
didn’t necessarily believe that gave you a reason to go to war. We had to be the people
putting forward one last push for peace.”
244.  In a subsequent conversation with Dr Rice, Sir David Manning said that in his
report on 14 February, Dr Blix would need to answer the questions which had been
raised at the end of January. They were central to the issue of non-co-operation.68
245.  In a discussion on public opinion, Sir David Manning said that the position
in the UK was:
“… a great deal more difficult … There was a strong wish to find a peaceful way of
disarming Saddam and avoid taking military action. French and German claims that
this was still possible were seized on eagerly, however implausible the proposals …”
246.  Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the possibility of public statements from
President Bush emphasising that resolving the Iraq crisis through the UN was critical
to the future of the Security Council. Sir David encouraged Dr Rice to consider whether
President Bush would be willing to speak out strongly about the need to give new
impetus to the MEPP: “That would have a great impact” on international opinion.
247.  Mr Campbell wrote that, on 11 February, Mr Blair had “decided that maybe we
took the wrong line” on the Der Spiegel report, “maybe we should say it was interesting
because it accepted conventional inspections wouldn’t work and was effectively arguing
for taking the country over without saying so”. Mr Blair and No.10 officials had “grasped
our way to a plan that was basically wait for Blix, then surface the elements of a second
resolution that included the ultimatum, then Saddam to go, and if he didn’t we were
going to go for it”.69

248.  Sir John Holmes reported that he had been informed that little more had been
discussed between Presidents Putin and Chirac than had appeared in the declaration;
the report in Der Spiegel was “extravagant”; and France had never raised the idea
of UN peacekeeping forces.70

Mr Straw’s speech, 11 February 2003
249.  Mr Straw set out a detailed case for confronting the challenge posed by Iraq
in a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies on 11 February.
250.  In a speech made at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) on
11 February, Mr Straw set out “the disturbing outcome of a failure to act decisively to
secure Iraq’s disarmament” and the need, “for the sake of the Iraqi people, long-term
stability in the Middle East, the credibility of the UN and the cause of international law
and collective security”, to confront the challenge posed by Iraq.71
251.  Mr Straw argued that international terrorism and the proliferation of WMD were
the “crucial strategic questions of our time” and the response to those threats would
“determine the stability of the world for generations to come”. That was “an awesome
responsibility” which called for “courageous leadership” and required “the vision and
foresight to act decisively and – if necessary – with military force before our worst
nightmares are realised”.
252.  Saddam Hussein’s regime typified the threat in which rogue regimes sheltered
individuals plotting “mayhem and mass murder in our streets”. Mr Straw stated:
“Weapons of mass destruction have been a central pillar of Saddam’s dictatorship
since the 1980s. He has amassed poisons and viruses both to suppress his own
people, and to threaten his neighbours. He has relentlessly pursued his ultimate
ambition, the acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability, in flagrant disregard
of SCRs and Iraq’s obligations as a non-nuclear weapons state under the
Non-Proliferation Treaty. His pursuit of these weapons has lain at the heart
of the UN’s stand-off with Iraq for the past 12 years.”
253.  Examining “six of the most commonly expressed arguments about the
UK Government’s approach”, Mr Straw argued that:

•	

70 
71 

The Iraqi threat to Europe and the US was not “overstated”. Resolution
1441 recognised the “singular menace” from Iraq’s weapons of mass
destruction. UNSCOM had had some successes, including overseeing the
destruction of “significant quantities” of weaponry, but when the inspectors left
in 1998, it was “clear that the regime continued to hold vast stocks of deadly
weaponry”. The absence of inspectors since 1998 had “allowed Saddam to

accelerate his weapons programmes”. The report published in autumn 2002 (the
September dossier) had “demonstrated determined efforts” to enhance Iraq’s
nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities. Dr Blix’s report to the Security
Council in January had “underlined these concerns”. Diplomacy, intelligence
co-operation, reinforced export controls, and interdiction and disruption of
supplies were options being used to “frustrate the ambitions” of other regimes.
But “in respect of Iraq”, those options had been “exhausted … over 12 long
years”. It was the “deadly combination of capability and intent” which made
Saddam Hussein “uniquely dangerous”. Rogue regimes which showed “total
disregard for the rule of law, and share the terrorists’ hatred of our values” were
the “most likely source of materials and know-how”. Given Saddam Hussein’s
“longstanding support for terrorist causes”, the “terrifying possibility that his
poisons and diseases” would “find their way into the hands of Al Qaida and
its sympathisers” could not be ruled out.
Backing diplomatic efforts with the credible threat of force did not
undermine international law. Law required enforcement and Iraq’s failure
to comply with “23 out of 27 separate obligations under Chapter VII of the
UN Charter” had “done great harm to the UN’s credibility”. Failure “to back
our words with deeds” would “follow one of the most catastrophic precedents
in history”: the failure of the League of Nations to face up to the challenges of
the 1930s. If the weapons inspectors confirmed “the behaviour which has put
Iraq in continuing material breach, then the case for a second resolution will
be overwhelming”.
Disarmament by force could be needed even if containment was working.
The key was Iraq’s immediate compliance with resolution 1441 and its active
co-operation to ensure its disarmament. The “proposals” for a No-Fly Zone
covering the whole of Iraq and for thousands of UN troops to assist and protect
the inspectors were “simply not feasible in the absence of complete Iraqi
co-operation” and “not necessary” if there was “co-operation”. If the weapons
inspectors were “unable to provide” a guarantee that Iraq was complying with
its obligations, Iraq would “have to face the ‘serious consequences’” defined
in resolution 1441; disarmament by force. The UK did not want war and hoped
that “Saddam Hussein would recognise the gravity of the situation and embark
on the pathway to peaceful disarmament”, but “the time had arrived to back our
demands with the credible threat of force”.
Military action would not have a disproportionate effect on the Iraqi people
or the wider region. The UK had to “strain every sinew, even at this late stage,
to avoid war; to force Saddam to face the fact that he has to comply; to offer,
as we have already, an escape route to exile for him and his entourage”. But
if military action did “prove necessary”, “huge efforts” would “be made to ensure
that the suffering of the Iraqi people” was “as limited as is possible”. The Iraqi
people deserved “the chance to live fulfilling lives free from the oppression
and terror of Saddam”; and to “choose their own destiny and government, and

226

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

•	

to pursue a prosperous life within a safe environment”. The UK’s first objective
was disarmament, but the “next priority would be to work with the United Nations
to help the Iraqi people recover … and allow their country to move towards one
that is ruled by law, respects international obligations and provides effective
and representative government”.
Control of Iraq’s oil was not the motivation for action. The mission was
disarmament. Iraq’s oilfields would be protected from any acts of environmental
terrorism, and the revenue generated would be used to benefit the Iraqi people.
The UK was not guilty of double standards in relation to the conflict
between Israel and Palestine. The UK was “working tirelessly” to achieve the
implementation of UN Security Council resolutions in respect of Israel/Palestine;
a conflict that had “long provided terrorists with a convenient rallying point”. As
long as that dispute was unresolved, collective security would “remain elusive”.

Discussions on the timing and content of a second resolution
254.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the UK wanted to delay tabling
a resolution until after a special European Council which would take place
on 17 February.
255.  The US continued to resist UK proposals for a draft resolution containing
either an ultimatum to Saddam to leave or a timetable for a decision.
256.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke three times on 11 February.
257.  In the first conversation, they discussed US reservations about including
an ultimatum in the resolution and the timing of a draft.72
258.  Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw telephoned Secretary Powell to set
out concerns that tabling a resolution before the European Council would be interpreted
as pre-empting the meeting.73 Mr Straw stated that the “critical thing” on both timing and
content would be “what tactically was most likely to ensure nine votes and no veto”.
He had asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock for a menu of options.
259.  Secretary Powell had asked whether Mr Blair really wanted an ultimatum
in the resolution; it might be better for it to be delivered personally by President Bush
or Mr Blair.
260.  The record of the FCO Iraq evening meeting on 11 February reported that Mr Blair
and Mr Straw had agreed that the UK would run with the text of a draft resolution agreed

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

between the US and UK Missions to the UN in New York which did not include any
ultimatum or deadline.74
261.  In a third conversation, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell again discussed the timing
and the US reservations about including an ultimatum.75
262.  Mr Straw reported that he had argued in favour of inclusion, but it had
subsequently occurred to him that it might be possible to table a simple resolution and
discuss the merits of an ultimatum with partners. If that attracted a consensus, it could
be adopted. That could be less difficult than starting off with an ultimatum and then
dropping it from a resolution.
263.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US wanted to keep the option
of tabling the resolution immediately after the reports to the Security Council
on 14 February to send the message that the US and UK were not going to
wait around.
264.  Sir Jeremy also stated that Security Council members would be very
reluctant to grant cover for military action within weeks and the draft resolution
might not secure nine positive votes.
265.  The FCO instructions to the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS
New York) on 11 February set out the questions the UK wanted Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei
to address: “to ensure that the 14 February update … is as uncomfortable as possible
for the Iraqis … and ensure the Iraqis cannot avoid the hard questions.”76
266.  Following consultations with Ambassador Negroponte on 11 February, Sir Jeremy
Greenstock advised that Washington was coming to the conclusion that it might be
necessary to table the draft resolution on 14 February to keep a priority place for the
US/UK language, provide an alternative to the Franco-German proposals and create
an “implication that the US/UK were not going to wait around”.77
267.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Rice’s response to the UK “ultimatum ideas” had
been “reluctant”.
268.  Sir Jeremy also reported that, in a conversation between Mr John Howard, the
Australian Prime Minister, and Mr Annan, Dr Blix had said “there was no evidence of
a fundamental shift in the Iraqi approach, though he ‘detected the possibility of a shift
in the future’”. Mr Annan was reported to have:
“… given … the impression that he accepted the inevitability of military action at
some point, but was focused on gaining more time: not for the inspectors, because

he realised the limitations; more for the Security Council, as he saw that more than
a few days would be needed to find language that brought people together.”
269.  Commenting on the debate in London on ideas for the final stages of diplomatic
activity, Sir Jeremy advised that the Franco-German proposals for reinforced inspections
would be:
“… recognised by the Security Council middle ground as a delaying tactic and
unlikely to make a difference on complete disarmament … But Council members
remain very reluctant to grant cover for military action within weeks … The
Americans may be upbeat about the likely effect of their lobbying and cajoling.
But I cannot say at this point that we would definitely get nine votes for a material
breach resolution on the basis of what seem to be the Blix/ElBaradei intentions
for the 14 February report.
“Injecting an ultimatum … might possibly help at the margins … though I would
hesitate to bank on it. If the ultimatum was directed at Saddam’s departure …
that would be a clearer criterion than offering up elements of WMD. But the
Americans are right that the Council majority are expressly opposed to the idea
of regime change …”
270.  Sir Jeremy suggested consideration of “a more radical halfway-house plan”:
“If the UK has to be sure of recapturing the initiative, we may have to think bolder.
We should test the Franco-German model to destruction. A Chapter VII resolution
authorising all necessary means for the specific purpose of hunting down hidden
WMD is worth considering. The objective has to be to place enough Coalition troops
on the ground, with No-Fly and No-Drive Zones declared by the Security Council
throughout Iraq, for mobile WMD transports etc to be tracked down, revealed and
destroyed. Baghdad and other major cities would be left to one side, at least for the
first stage. There could be arrangements for interviews offering greater protection
than the present.”
271.  Sir Jeremy thought that, when faced with the alternatives, Council members would
“rally to this approach”. But it might not “readily fit” the American “military preferences”.
Sir Jeremy wrote:
“… the most important aspect … would be Saddam’s reaction. He would bitterly
oppose a UN-authorised take-over of parts of Iraq. If it were imposed on him, he
might quickly break the no-resistance conditions. In that case, the ‘last resort’ would
have been much more clearly established.”
272.  Sir Jeremy concluded:
“This plan does not have to be used immediately. We could go through the stages
of presenting and arguing for the second resolution of the kind we have been
discussing, before coming to a final decision. But the prospects of a 15-0 SCR

229

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

(even the Arabs might see the advantages, provided the end-objective was an Iraq
for Iraqis), and of a stronger consensus in the EU and NATO, needs to be weighed
against all the lateral implications of the wave we are riding at present.”
273.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that there was a need to regain the political
and public relations initiative.
274.  Mr Blair was considering the approach to a second resolution.
275.  Mr Blair had also identified the need to make the case publicly that the
US and the UK were making ‘one last push for peace’.
276.  On 12 February, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed the progress of
inspections, including the outcome of the visit by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to Baghdad.78
Sir David commented that the inspectors only needed intelligence because Iraq was
not co-operating.
277.  Sir David Manning also gave Dr Rice an account of the UK’s current thinking on a
second resolution, which he described as “very much work in progress”. He reported that
Mr Blair had “yet to take any decisions”; the UK and US now had to regain the political
and public relations initiative.
278.  Mr Blair would be making a major speech that weekend to “set out the arguments
again, but to do so in the context of one last pitch for peace”. Mr Blair “would probably
say that the time had come to accept that Saddam was in breach of 1441 and
that we should now table a second resolution insisting that he must go or face the
consequences”. Sir David said that the ultimatum need not be in the resolution itself,
but that “we must indicate our readiness to allow to Saddam to leave within a short,
specified period so offering the chance of avoiding war”.
279.  Sir David also outlined Mr Blair’s plan to write to Mr Costas Simitis, the Greek
Prime Minister in advance of the European Council, and the need to generate
momentum to attract support.
280.  Commenting on the position after the call, Sir David wrote that the UK would need
to think further about the timing for tabling the draft resolution over the next 24 hours.
281.  The UK decided to continue to explore the possibility of including an
ultimatum in the resolution with the US.
282.  The FCO informed Sir Jeremy Greenstock on 12 February that Ministers were
“broadly content” with the draft resolution he had provided the previous day (following
discussions on 10 February) but had decided, before receipt of his later advice, that

78 

Letter Manning to McDonald, 12 February 2003, ‘Iraq: Conversation with Condi Rice’.

230

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

the UK should continue to explore with the US the possibility of adding an ultimatum,
aimed particularly at getting Saddam to step down, to the draft resolution.79
283.  Two possible options for an ultimatum in a draft resolution were set out:
“Decides that unless the Council concludes before x March 2003 that a government
has emerged in Iraq which [intends to] [has demonstrated its intention to] [has
taken an unconditional and irreversible decision to] come into compliance with its
obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and previous relevant resolutions, Iraq
will face the serious consequences it has been repeatedly warned of, including in
para 13 of resolution 1441 (2002).”
Or:
“Decides that unless the Council concludes before x March 2003 that the
government of Iraq has taken an unconditional and irreversible decision to come into
compliance with its obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and previous relevant
resolutions, Iraq will face the serious consequences it has repeatedly been warned
of, including in para 13 of resolution 1441 (2002).”
284.  The telegram also set out the option, identified by Mr Straw following his third
conversation with Secretary Powell on 11 February, of taking soundings before tabling
an ultimatum.
285.  In relation to Sir Jeremy’s own suggestions, the FCO took the view that there
would be “serious obstacles”. It did not think that authorising all necessary means
to hunt down WMD would meet the disarmament objectives, particularly if Baghdad
and other cities were left aside. The key was:
“… co-operation rather than resources. For example work on BW can be very
easily concealed under legitimate guises … Without full access to documents and
full co-operation from personnel, it would be impossible to guarantee success.”
286.  The FCO also identified difficulties with providing scientists “adequate protection
while they remain under Saddam’s regime”, and practical problems with assembling
and protecting a UN force.
287.  The record of the FCO Iraq evening meeting on 12 February reported concerns
that some members of the US Administration were “increasingly inclined” to table the
resolution straight after Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 14 February.80
288.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Dr Blix that the US was worried about
losing backing and momentum and saw only one way to deal with Iraq’s
non-co-operation.

231

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

289.  Sir Jeremy recommended that in the Security Council meeting on
14 February, the UK should seek to draw out the truth about non-co-operation.
290.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had told Dr Blix on 12 February that an
ultimatum remained an option and that they had discussed how to create a concrete
ultimatum which required Iraqi co-operation on substance.81
291.  Sir Jeremy had set out the UK position that:
“… pushing for reinforced inspections was a mistake. The Security Council needed
to realise that Saddam was in denial of 1441 and there had to be a firm decision that
he either gave up his WMD or left Iraq, or faced military action.”
292.  In response to Dr Blix’s questions about the issue coming to a head after only two
and a half months and the timing of military action, Sir Jeremy had replied that, “more
than the climate”, the “US was worried about losing backing and momentum and saw
only one way to deal with Iraqi non-co-operation. That was why we were running out of
time”. He had “added” that he had “always felt that the best way to keep the UN together
was through a WMD find which demonstrated the Iraqi lie”. In Sir Jeremy’s view, “by
distracting from the main issue of Iraqi co-operation and giving the Iraqis false hope,
the French ideas could make war more likely”.
293.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had also raised the possibility of using UNMOVIC
expertise in a post-war scenario.
294.  Commenting on the conversation, Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix “genuinely
believes that inspections still have something to contribute, but could not claim that
he had acquired anything of substance out of the recent period”. Dr Blix was:
“… torn between time for more peaceful disarmament through inspections and
helping to pile on the pressure to make the Iraqis crack. He would have been
more inclined to follow the latter course if he felt less certain that the Americans
were hell-bent on war anyway.”
295.  Sir Jeremy suggested that Mr Straw should use his intervention in the Council
meeting on 14 February to pose questions for Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei “that draw out
the non-co-operation truths”.
PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 12 FEBRUARY 2003
296.  Mr Blair told the House of Commons on 12 February that the Security
Council should be the judge of whether there was full and complete co-operation
from Iraq with the inspectors.

81 

Telegram 247 UKMIS New York to FCO London, 13 February 2003, ‘Iraq: Conversation with Dr Blix’.

232

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

297.  Mr Blair also emphasised the costs to the Iraqi people of continuing
the policy of containment.
298.  Mr Blair was asked several questions on Iraq during Prime Minister’s Questions
(PMQs) on 12 February.82
299.  In response to questions about whether he would support Dr Blix if he asked
on 14 February for more time for inspections, Mr Blair said that the UK would “take full
account of anything” Dr Blix said, but the issue was about Iraq’s co-operation and the
time needed to make a judgement about whether that was happening:
“… the judgement that has to be made in the end is one by the Security Council
as to whether there is full and complete co-operation by Iraq with the United
Nations inspectors.”
300.  Mr Blair warned that there was a:
“… danger that we get sucked back into delays of months then years, with the
inspectors playing a game of hide and seek with Saddam and we are unable then
to shut down the weapons of mass destruction programme … that everyone accepts
is a threat and a danger to the world.”
301.  Asked whether military action would make peace in the Middle East more likely
and Britain less of a target for terrorists, Mr Blair replied that if Saddam Hussein had
“complied fully” with resolution 1441, conflict would not be an issue. The choice was
Saddam’s, but:
“… if we fail to implement resolution 1441, and if we lack the determination and
resolution to make sure that that mandate is carried, the consequence will be that
Saddam is free to develop weapons of mass destruction. Also there will be an
increasing risk that the threat of those weapons of mass destruction and the existing
terrorist threat will join together. This country will then be less secure and safe.”
302.  Asked why people were not persuaded of the threat, Mr Blair replied that it would
“be different if there is a second resolution”. People believed that Saddam Hussein was
“evil” and that there was “a threat to this country from his accumulated weapons of mass
destruction”, but they asked if there was an alternative to war. That alternative was “full
and complete co-operation”.
303.  Asked what new, proven or imminent threat there was to justify war, Mr Blair said
that had been identified in resolution 1441 and the preceding 12 years and that there
were two ways to deal with it, disarmament or sanctions. If there was a decision to go
to war, the morality of that “should weigh heavily on our conscience because innocent
people die as well as the guilty in a war”. But the way in which Saddam Hussein had

82 

House of Commons, Official Report, 12 February 2003, columns 857-860.

233

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

implemented the policy of sanctions meant that too was “a moral choice with bad and
devastating consequences for the Iraqi people”.
304.  Asked about the origins and accuracy of the dossier produced by No.10, (‘Iraq –
Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’ – see Section 4.3),
Mr Blair said that the part of the document that dealt with intelligence was from
intelligence sources and was accurate, as was the document as a whole.
305.  In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote:
“What was novel … was the way in which Tony has shifted the terms in which
he justifies military intervention. For the first time he argued that war would be
preferable to sanctions because of the suffering and malnutrition that comes
in the wake of sanctions.”83

UK views on UNMOVIC inspections
306.  At Sir Richard Dearlove’s request, his Private Secretary sent an update
on the progress of inspections to Sir David Manning on 12 February.84
307.  Sir David was told that the strike rate in relation to the UK intelligence-led
inspections was low, but it had been responsible for two out of three UNMOVIC finds
to date, from more than 550 inspections. In addition, “even where there is no WMD,
something else has often been concealed […] Our inspections have revealed the
Iraqi game.”
308.  Sir Richard’s update also stated that “we needed to keep going in the expectation
that an intelligence-led inspection would lead to a find or a solid refusal of entry”.
309.  Sir David sent the letter to Mr Powell with the comment: “More inspections ahead –
but time getting very short.”85
310.  The UK used about 30 separate pieces of intelligence from human sources and
satellite imagery covering 19 sites to provide leads for the UN inspectors. UNMOVIC
visited seven of those sites, made a partial examination of one more and subjected one
further site to an inspection by ground-penetrating radar.86
311.  In a ‘Note’ produced on 12 February, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) Counter
Proliferation Support Group reported that UNMOVIC and the IAEA had conducted over
550 site visits or inspections.87

312.  UNMOVIC had moved more quickly to establish the inspection process than
originally envisaged. It had begun work on 27 November 2002, almost a month earlier
than the deadline of 23 December in resolution 1441. It had also been able to establish
the Baghdad Ongoing Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Centre (BOMVIC) and
a temporary centre at Mosul more quickly than the 60 days it thought would be needed
before entering Iraq.
313.  Most of the site visits conducted during the first six weeks were “intended [to]
familiarise inspectors with the sites, and inspection techniques”. In addition, inspectors
checked the equipment which had been tagged by UNSCOM, examined remote
cameras and asked about work carried out at sites since 1998. Some visits had been
superficial. From early January, “the inspections had become longer and more intrusive”.
314.  Initially UNMOVIC had been hampered by a lack of support equipment, personnel
and experience. It had taken UNMOVIC until mid-December to get to near full strength
with 100 inspectors. The inspectors were on short contracts with “a consequent loss of
expertise” and “few” had experience of operating in Iraq.
315.  UNMOVIC had acknowledged the problems. By the beginning of February, it
had “visited or inspected all but one of the UK’s recommended sites”, and continued
to be receptive to UK advice on potential targets. “Fatigue” was, however, “becoming
a significant factor” which had been “reflected in an increasing number of accidents”
during inspections. Fatigue was the result of:
“… a combination of the pace of the inspection programme; Iraqi pressure; the
perceived need for a ‘success’; and concern for personal safety in the event of war.”
316.  During January and early February, “a total of 22 biological associated scientists
and missile experts refused to meet inspectors in private”. The three scientists who had
agreed to interviews were “selected by the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate”. Even
if Baghdad did concede interviews, all the scientists would be “concerned that anything
they say will become known to the Iraqi authorities”.
317.  Finds had included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“nuclear-related documents hidden at the home of […] an Iraqi scientist” on
16 January, although “the general perception has been that these do not
constitute a ‘smoking gun’”;
“CW associated rocket warheads at Ukhaider ammunition depot” the same
day. The liquid in one warhead was “awaiting the delivery of chemical sampling
equipment”. That had arrived but was “not yet operational”;
a “small quantity of … CW precursor chemicals at a Laboratory”;
“aluminium nozzles for 80mm rockets that Iraq had recast, but not declared”
were discovered by the IAEA on 31 January; and
“parts” from a “suspected … biological or chemical sub-munition” were found
“at the al-Numan factory”.
235

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

318.  The Iraqis realised that some inspections had “been mounted on the basis of
intelligence,” and had “increased even further” the measures being taken to prevent
damaging material being uncovered by either UNMOVIC or the IAEA. That included
“ensuring that WMD material only remains at a particular location for an absolute
maximum of 24 hours, and contingency plans to ensure that ‘crowds’ will always
be available to disrupt an inspection that might prove successful”.
319.  The DIS report concluded that:
“While UNMOVIC is gaining in confidence, the inspectors are under increasing
pressure at a time when consideration is having to be given to a possible
evacuation. Internally, despite the full inspection programme having been under
way for only some five weeks, there is already a sense that time is running out.
“UNMOVIC and the IAEA are capable of conducting thorough inspections;
however, mistakes have resulted in at least two inspections failing to uncover
concealed material …
“UNMOVIC and IAEA remain very receptive to UK intelligence. On balance,
however, in the absence of Iraqi cooperation, we assess that the discovery
of a ‘smoking gun’ will probably be the result of intelligence information, skill
on the part of the inspectors, an Iraqi mistake, and an element of luck.”
320.  Mr Blair told Mr John Howard that the inspectors’ reports of 28 February
should be the final reports to the Security Council.
321.  A BBC poll published on 13 February found that 60 percent of people questioned
thought that the UK and US Governments had failed to prove their case that Iraq had
WMD, and 45 percent said that the UK should play no part in a war on Iraq, whatever
the UN decided. Fewer than 10 percent said that they would back a war with Iraq without
a second resolution.88
322.  Mr Blair and Mr Howard discussed Dr Blix’s forthcoming report and the prospects
for a second resolution in a breakfast meeting on 13 February.89
323.  Sir David Manning advised that there would be a need to challenge
Dr Blix’s likely assessment that there had been some movement on process
and some movement on interviews; and to focus in public “on the underlying
message that there was no fundamental change in attitude, and the key questions
remained unanswered”. International opinion should not be allowed “to be distracted
by nuances about process”.

324.  Other points which Mr Blair and Mr Howard discussed included:

•	
•	
•	

Dr Blix was writing his report on the presumption that there would be more time
and it was implicit in his approach that there would be more time.
Concern that the report would be critical of Secretary Powell’s presentation
to the UN on 5 February.
Russia and China were likely to abstain in a vote on a second resolution and
France and Germany might put forward a rival text.

325.  Mr Blair told Mr Howard that:
“… people in the UK were suspicious that the US were eager to use force and did
not want the inspections to work. They could accept the need for war, but not for war
now. If Blix came up with a firm report that could change. The report on the 28th [of
February] should be the final report. The US needed in parallel to ensure the support
of the Security Council.”
326.  In response to Mr Howard’s assessment that a second resolution was not needed
for legal reasons, Mr Powell said that UK lawyers were studying the issue. Mr Blair said
it was needed for political reasons.
327.  In the subsequent press conference, Mr Blair stated that the discussion had been
“dominated” by Iraq.90 He and Prime Minister Howard had agreed that Iraq needed to
disarm and resolution 1441 had to be upheld.
328.  Prime Minister Howard praised Mr Blair’s “strong and principled stance” and his
“strong and effective leadership” and stated that he believed:
“… very strongly that if the whole world speaking through the United Nations
Security Council said with one clear voice to Iraq that it had to disarm then that
would more than anything else be likely to bring forth the faint hope of a peaceful
solution.”
329.  In reply to a question, Mr Howard stated that the problem was not time, it was
Iraq’s attitude.
330.  Mr Blair was asked whether Iraq’s ballistic missiles were enough to justify military
action; and whether the news overnight of a North Korean threat that its missiles could
hit US targets anywhere in the world “presented a more urgent and larger threat to
international stability”. He replied that the judgement on Iraq had to be “made in the
round” in the context of resolution 1441. In relation to the need to confront the threat
from North Korea, albeit “by different means”, Mr Blair emphasised that the United
Nations would be “tremendously weakened and undermined” if it showed “weakness
and uncertainty over Iraq”. That was “the key issue”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Cabinet, 13 February 2003
331.  Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced on 12 February
that he was allocating a further £750m to help meet the costs of potential military action
in Iraq.91
332.  Mr Blair convened a meeting on humanitarian issues with Mr Straw, Mr Hoon,
Ms Short, Adm Boyce and No.10 officials in the margins of Cabinet on 13 February.92
That meeting is addressed in Section 6.5.
333.  In Cabinet on 13 February, Mr Straw stated that Iraq was not co-operating
on substance and its Al Samoud missiles and engines could be further evidence
of a material breach of resolution 1441. The authority of the UN was at stake.
334.  Mr Hoon stated that the second resolution needed to provide straightforward
legal justification for taking military action.
335.  Mr Blair concluded that there was no point in conceding more time for
inspections if the lack of co-operation did not permit the inspectors to do their
job. The “best course was to keep our nerve and persevere”.
336.  Mr Straw told Cabinet on 13 February that the UN inspectors were likely to tell
the Security Council on 14 February that:
“… the Iraqis were co-operating a bit more on the process but not on the substance.
One issue of significance could be the inspectors’ attitude to the Al Samoud missiles
and the 223 new Volga engines, which they could decide were in breach of Iraq’s
obligations. That would be further evidence of material breach.”93
He would report to the House of Commons later that day that Iraq had been, and
continued to be in material breach; and that further confirmation of the facts by the
inspectors “would lead logically to a Security Council resolution”.
337.  Mr Straw also reported difficulties in NATO over a request from Turkey for support.
That was “a serious situation which was pulling NATO apart”. The Presidency of the EU
had called a summit [meeting of the European Council] for 17 February.
338.  Mr Straw told his colleagues that:
“… the authority of the United Nations was at stake. There was a parallel with the
failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s to enforce international law … The best
chance of avoiding military action was to hold our nerve in keeping to the United
Nations process.”

339.  Reporting on his visit to the US, Mr Hoon told Cabinet that the US Administration
“had a good appreciation” of the Government’s political situation. In his view, it would
be “important politically” that any further resolution “should be simple” and “provide
straightforward legal justification for taking military action”; “obscurity or justification
relying on bureaucratic references back to earlier resolutions” should be avoided.
340.  The points made in discussion included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the authority of the UN “could be undermined both by a failure to act and
by action taken without its sanction”;
the tone of public communications “should not give the impression of a rush
to war: there was a benefit in a distinctively British approach”;
while public opinion “did not seem persuaded of the necessity of war,
it appeared to support military action when combined with a further
Security Council resolution”;
emphasis had to be given to the future welfare of the Iraqi people as well
as the re-invigoration of the MEPP;
work “had started” in the US to “put in place structures for the recovery
and reconstruction of Iraq in the event of military conflict”.

341.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that the Government “should maintain
the integrity” of the UN process. That “did not mean allowing Iraq to prolong inspections
indefinitely”. Iraq had:
“… been given a final chance to comply and full co-operation was required,
otherwise the issue returned to the Security Council for discussion. There was no
point in conceding more time for inspections if the lack of co-operation did not permit
the inspectors to do their job.”
342.  Mr Blair expected public opinion “to shift before we got to the point of military
action. Some polling showed that there would be support both in the event of a further
Security Council resolution and if the majority of the Security Council supported action
despite a veto”. Strenuous efforts were being made to avoid the alienation of France and
Germany. The UK would stand up for itself and had support in Europe. The international
community need to be engaged in dealing with the humanitarian consequences of
Saddam Hussein’s rule in Iraq. The “best course was to keep our nerve and persevere”.
343.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Cook had “really played up the extent of the opposition”
on Iraq, and that he might be “putting down a marker” about his departure: “He was
clearly very offside and had become more so.”94

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

344.  In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote that he had offered three suggestions for how
“we should conduct ourselves if we are going to reconnect with the public”:
“We could stop appearing to force the pace on the war. The public will only follow
us if they believe we are reluctant about conflict …
“We need to find a distinctive British tone in which we address the Iraq crisis.
We should stop appearing as the US and UK axis.
“We should stick to the UN like glue. If tomorrow Hans Blix asks for more time
for inspectors, he must get it. If we depart from the UN process we shall be
committing suicide …”95
345.  Mr Campbell wrote that there was also a meeting with Mr Straw on tactics for the
second resolution and whether it should be tabled before the European Council.96
346.  Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed the next steps and tactics and timings
on 13 February, including concerns about a possible Franco-German initiative.97
347.  Sir David told Dr Rice that the UK preference was to wait to table a second
resolution until after the special EU Council on Iraq, unless circumstances dictated
an earlier date.
348.  In the meeting of the Security Council the following day, the UK aim was to move
the discussion away from process and focus it on substance: “The best bet seemed to
be to put a series of very tough questions to Blix about Iraqi performance and insist on
very clear answers.” The UK did not want “Saturday’s headlines being about calls in the
Security Council to give the inspectors more time”.
349.  In his record of the discussion, Sir David commented: “We should also have a draft
resolution in our back pockets, ready to put down at a moment’s notice.”
350.  Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Washington,
wrote to Sir David Manning on 13 February stating:
“Sitting in on Mr Hoon’s meetings with Condi Rice and Don Rumsfeld [Mr Donald
Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense] yesterday I was very struck by how the military
timetable is now driving the diplomatic end game.”98

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

Mr Straw’s statement, 13 February 2003
351.  Mr Straw told the House of Commons on 13 February that the conclusion
that Iraq was in further material breach of resolution 1441 was “inescapable”.
352.  A peaceful outcome to the crisis depended on maintaining unrelenting
pressure on Saddam Hussein to disarm, and a decision by him to co-operate.
353.  Because the House of Commons would be in recess the following week, Mr Straw
made a statement on 13 February.99
354.  Mr Straw said that the reports presented by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on
27 January had “painted a disturbing picture”. “Most damning of all” was Dr Blix’s
observation that Iraq appeared “not to have come to a genuine acceptance” of the
demand for disarmament. Mr Straw added that the central premise of Iraq’s “so-called
disclosure”, that Iraq possessed no WMD “was, and remains, a lie”. “Nor was there any
admission of Iraq’s extensive efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction since …
December 1998” when the inspectors were “effectively excluded from Iraq”.
355.  Mr Straw stated that the briefings on 27 January and Secretary Powell’s
presentation to the Security Council on 5 February left “no doubt that Iraq had
failed to meet” the “two clear tests for further material breach” set out in resolution
1441. Mr Straw added : “The conclusion is therefore inescapable: Iraq is in further
material breach …”
356.  The points made by Mr Straw included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

99 

He still hoped and prayed “for a peaceful outcome to the crisis”, but that would
only be possible if “unrelenting pressure” was maintained on Saddam Hussein,
“including the threat of force, rather than casting around for excuses to delay”.
If the international community “lost its nerve”, that would “significantly undermine
the UN’s authority and make the world a much more dangerous place, as
dictators got the message that international law consisted of mere words and
nothing else”.
French and German calls to “bolster the inspections regime” would not
“deliver the assurance the world needs” and were “unrealistic and impractical”.
They shifted “the burden of proof from Iraq … to the inspectors”; and sent
“Saddam the signal that defiance pays”.
Armed intervention was not inevitable and a peaceful resolution of the crisis
remained in Saddam’s hands. But the inspectors would “not be able to fulfil their
mandate to verify Iraqi disarmament” without Iraq’s compliance. In that event,
resolution 1441 warned Iraq to expect “serious consequences”: “By now, even
Saddam Hussein must be under no illusions: that can only mean disarmament
by force.”

House of Commons, Official Report, 13 February 2003, columns 1056-1071.

241

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

357.  The points made by Mr Alan Duncan (Conservative) included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Diplomatic relations between the US and France and Germany were “to put it
mildly, scratchy”, but relations between Western democracies should not “slide
into disarray”.
The Conservative Party shared the judgement, enshrined in resolution 1441,
that the cost of doing nothing was greater than the cost of doing something”.
The UK should not resile from implementing resolution 1441.
Given “the doubting mood of public opinion”, the Government should focus
on Saddam Hussein’s arsenal of weapons, not other issues such as links with
terrorism and the publication of an “utterly substandard dossier” which diverted
attention from the main issue and dented the Government’s credibility.
Was a second resolution, which a “fortnight ago” had “seemed a dead cert”,
now touch and go?

358.  Mr Mark Oaten (Liberal Democrat):

•	
•	

Expressed concerns about the impact on the unity of the international
community of ignoring a veto by one of the Permanent Members of the
Security Council.
Asked why Mr Straw was dismissing the options of further UN inspection and
containment. If the inspectors believed that “with more time, co-operation and
space, progress could be made, they should be given more time”.

359.  In response to those points, and subsequent questions, which included both
support for action and concerns, points made by Mr Straw included:

•	
•	

•	

It would be the Government’s decision whether or not to move a resolution.
It would make decisions after the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council the
following day; decisions would be reported to the House of Commons as quickly
as possible.
The Government was asking all the members of the Security Council, when
they assessed the inspectors’ reports, “to follow through the true meaning of
the language to which every single member … signed up”. The UK and other
members of the Security Council could not be in a position where they believed
the “conclusions following from the true meaning of 1441” were “inescapable,
but one member, for example”, sought “to avoid those conclusions”.
Resolution 1441 was “a sufficient mandate” for military action because it spelled
out “with complete clarity” that there were “obligations on Iraq that it must follow
through”, which were “very straightforward”.

It had been suggested during the negotiation that a requirement for a second
resolution “if military force was to take place” should be written into resolution
1441. That had been “dropped from the final draft”.
The UK should “seek to lower, not raise the temperature of relations” with
friendly nations. It did not want to be, and would not be, involved in
recriminations between friendly members of UN.
If the inspectors asked for more resources, that would be considered, but the UK
could not “be drawn into the argument from outside the inspectors’ ranks, which
seeks to imply that, in the absence of co-operation, more inspectors will resolve
the matter. They will not. Procrastination is not the solution to the problem;
co‑operation is.”
The evidence in respect of Iraq’s possession of “chemical and biological
weapons and weapons programmes, and its readiness to develop a nuclear
programme” was “overwhelming”. Iraq had been “found guilty” in 1991 and had
to “prove its innocence”. The “absence of evidence in a huge country where
there are only 100 inspectors” did “not prove the absence of a programme
… other circumstantial evidence” had to be examined. Iraq had had a highly
developed nuclear programme in 1991.
No one was “exaggerating the problem” and “no one had invented the fact that
Iraq had the programme [of weapons of mass destruction]”. Until Iraq proved
otherwise, the evidence suggested that Iraq continued to have “the programme”.
There was no evidence of links between Al Qaida and Iraq in respect of the
attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, although he “would not be surprised
if such evidence came forward”. There was “some evidence of links between the
Al Qaida organisation and Iraq, in terms of the Iraq regime allowing a permissive
environment for Al Qaida operatives”.
There had been “very active co-operation between the intelligence agencies
in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the weapons inspectors”.
He “shared the anxieties” about military action which “should only ever be a last
resort”, but “on occasions” it was “essential to enforce law by force, otherwise
the world becomes extremely dangerous”.
It “would have been better, in a way” to include the words “disarmament by
force” in the resolution, “but in diplomatic speak the choice was between ‘all
necessary means’ and ‘serious consequences’. Everybody in the diplomatic
community knows that ‘serious consequences’ means the use of force”.100

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Security Council, 14 February 2003
360.  The third Ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council to discuss Iraq took
place on 14 February.

Dr Blix’s report, 14 February 2003
361.  Dr Blix reported that UNMOVIC had not found any weapons of mass
destruction and the items that were not accounted for might not exist, but Iraq
needed to provide the evidence to answer the questions, not belittle them.
362.  Dr Blix pointed out that the evidence that Iraq had prepared for inspections
by cleaning up sites and removing evidence, presented to the Security Council
by Secretary Powell on 5 February, could have a different interpretation.
363.  Dr Blix told the Security Council that:

•	
•	
•	
•

101 

The total number of UNMOVIC staff in Iraq had increased to more than 250.
The regional office in Mosul was “fully operational” and plans for a regional
office in Basra were “being developed”. UNMOVIC had conducted more than
400 inspections covering more than 300 sites.
“All inspections were performed without notice, and access was almost always
provided promptly. In no case have we seen convincing evidence that the Iraqi
side knew in advance that the inspectors were coming.”
Inspections were “effectively helping to bridge the gap in knowledge” that had
arisen because of the absence of inspectors between December 1998 and
November 2002.
UNMOVIC had informed the Iraqi authorities that it planned to start U-2
surveillance flights early the following week and was still expanding its
capabilities.
Intelligence information provided to UNMOVIC had been “gradually increasing”.
But there were “limitations” and “misinterpretations” could occur.
Three persons who had previously refused interviews on UNMOVIC’s terms
had given “informative” interviews just before the visit to Baghdad by Dr Blix
and Dr ElBaradei. Dr Blix hoped that Iraq’s commitment to encourage persons
to accept interviews would mean further interviews would be accepted.
UNMOVIC had begun the process of destroying approximately 50 litres
of mustard gas declared by Iraq.
More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples had been
collected. Three-quarters of the samples had already been tested and the
results were consistent with Iraq’s declarations.101

UN Security Council, ‘4707th Meeting Friday 14 February 2003’ (S/PV.4707).

244

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

364.  Addressing how much, “if any” was left of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction,
Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC had not found any so far, “only a small number of empty
chemical munitions, which should have been declared and destroyed”. UNMOVIC had
destroyed the “laboratory quantity” of a “mustard gas precursor” that had been found.
Many proscribed weapons and items had not been accounted for, but:
“One must not jump to the conclusion that they exist. However that possibility
is also not excluded. If they exist they must be presented for destruction. If they
do not exist, credible evidence to that effect should be presented.”
365.  Referring to his warning on 27 January that Iraq should not brush aside questions
on significant outstanding issues of substance, including on anthrax, the nerve agent
VX and long range missiles, Dr Blix stated that the fact that Iraq had, in its declaration
of 7 December 2002, “missed the opportunity to provide the fresh material and evidence
needed to respond to the open questions” was “perhaps the most important problem
we are facing”. He added:
“Although I can understand that it may not be easy for Iraq in all cases to provide
the evidence needed, it is not the task of the inspectors to find it. Iraq itself must
squarely tackle this task and avoid belittling the questions.”
366.  Some papers had been provided in Baghdad on 9 February. Dr Blix stated that
“could be indicative of a more active attitude” but there were problems verifying the
quantities of anthrax and two precursors for VX which Iraq had unilaterally destroyed:
“Documentary evidence and testimony by staff who dealt with the items still appears to
be needed.” Iraq’s initiative to identify 83 participants “in the unilateral destruction in the
chemical field” appeared “useful and pertain[ed] to co-operation on substance”. Dr Blix
trusted that Iraq would put together a “similar list of names of persons who participated
in the unilateral destruction of other proscribed items”.
367.  Dr Blix also welcomed the extension of the mandate of an Iraqi commission to
look for any proscribed items and the appointment of a second commission to search
for documents relevant to the elimination of proscribed items and programmes. But they
would “evidently need to work fast and effectively to convince us, and the world, that it is
a serious effort”.
368.  Experts had “concluded unanimously” that the two variants of the Al Samoud 2
missile declared by Iraq were capable of exceeding the range of 150km. Those, and
any of the 380 SA-2 (Volga) engines which had been imported in contravention of
resolution 687 (1991) and converted for use in the Al Samoud missile system, were
proscribed. The casting chambers for missile motors were also proscribed. Clarifications
were needed before decisions could be made on the capabilities of the Al Fatah missile
and the al-Rafah engine test stand.

245

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

369.  In response to urgings that Iraq should implement the requirement in resolution
687 to enact legislation implementing the UN prohibitions on WMD, Iraq had told
UNMOVIC and the IAEA earlier that day that it had issued a Presidential Decree.
The text was being studied.
370.  Addressing the role of intelligence, Dr Blix stated that in the closed society of
Iraq, and the history of inspections, “other sources of information, such as defectors
and government intelligence agencies” were “required to aid the inspection process”.
International organisations then needed to analyse such information critically.
371.  Dr Blix added that intelligence had been useful for UNMOVIC, and in one case
had led to the discovery of documents relating to laser enrichment of uranium:
“In other cases, intelligence has led to sites where no proscribed items were
found. Even in such cases, however, inspection of these sites were useful in
proving the absence of such items and in some cases the presence of other
items – conventional munitions. It shows that conventional arms are being moved
around the country and their presence is not necessarily related to weapons of
mass destruction.”
372.  Referring to Secretary Powell’s presentation on 5 February, and in particular the
suggestion that “Iraq had prepared for inspections by cleaning up sites and removing
evidence of proscribed weapons programmes”, Dr Blix stated that he wanted to
comment on “the trucks identified by analysts as being for chemical decontamination
at a munitions depot”. That depot was a declared site, and one that Iraq would have
expected UNMOVIC to inspect. Dr Blix stated that: “We have noted that the two satellite
images of the site were taken several weeks apart. The reported movement of munitions
at the site could just as easily have been a routine activity as a movement of proscribed
munitions in anticipation of imminent inspection.” He added that: “Our reservation on this
point does not detract from our appreciation of the briefing.”
373.  Concluding his report, Dr Blix commented that:
“UNMOVIC is not infrequently asked how much more time it needs to complete its
task in Iraq. The answer depends on which task one has in mind … the disarmament
task – or the monitoring that no new proscribed activities occur …
“… Regrettably the high degree of co-operation required of Iraq for disarmament
through inspection was not forthcoming in 1991 …
“If Iraq had provided the necessary co-operation in 1991, the phase of disarmament
… could have been short and a decade of sanctions could have been avoided.
Today, three months after the adoption of resolution 1441 (2002) the period of
disarmament through inspection could still be short if ‘immediate, active and
unconditional cooperation’ with UNMOVIC and the IAEA were to be forthcoming.”

246

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

374.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that Dr Blix’s presentation had been “more
equivocal than 27 January, highlighting progress on process and other ‘hopeful’ signs
(e.g. new documents, the Iraqi commissions and the Iraqi decree on WMD)”.102
375.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that it paid to re-read Dr Blix’s reports of 14 February:
“It was clear that compliance was stepped up significantly as the prospect of military
action became more real, but it was also clear that the problem was unlikely to
be resolved unless those running Iraq had a genuine and not transitory change
of heart …
“They [UNMOVIC] were hopeful that Iraq could be disarmed; but the report still
concluded compliance had yet to conform to the requirement of the UN resolution
[1441] …”103

Dr ElBaradei’s report, 14 February 2003
376.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence of ongoing
prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities in Iraq, although a number
of issues were still under investigation.
377.  Dr ElBaradei reported that:

•	
•	
•	

•	
•	

The IAEA had conducted an additional 38 inspections at 19 locations since
his report to the Council on 27 January.
Iraq had continued to provide immediate access at all locations.
The IAEA had continued to interview key personnel and had recently been
able to conduct four interviews in private, although the interviewees had
recorded their interviews. In the meeting in Baghdad, Iraq had “reconfirmed its
commitment to encourage its citizens to accept interviews in private, both inside
and outside of Iraq”.
Iraq had expanded the list of relevant personnel to more than 300 to include
higher-level key scientists; IAEA continued to ask for information about
personnel of lesser rank.
The IAEA intended to increase the numbers of inspectors and support staff and
to “expand and intensify the range of technical meetings and interviews”.104

378.  Iraq had provided documentation relating to the reported attempt to import
uranium, the attempted procurement of aluminium tubes, the procurement of magnets
and magnet production capability, and the use of HMX. The IAEA was pursuing the

acquisition of uranium and examining issues in relation to aluminium tubes and magnets.
On HMX, the IAEA might be unable to reach a final conclusion:
“While we have no indication that this material was used for any application
other than declared by Iraq, we have no technical method of verifying … the
declared use …”
379.  In relation to “documents found on 16 January in the private residence of an Iraqi
scientist”, the IAEA had “completed a more detailed review”. The documents related
“predominantly to lasers, including the use of laser technology to enrich uranium”.
“Nothing” in the documents altered “the conclusions previously drawn by the IAEA”
about the extent of Iraq’s laser enrichment programme.
380.  Iraq had also provided documentation about questions and concerns which
had remained since 1998 about weapons and centrifuge design, but the documents
contained “no new information”. Dr ElBaradei hoped that “the new Iraqi commissions
… will be able to discover documents and other evidence that could assist in clarifying
remaining questions and concerns”.
381.  Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA would continue to expand its capabilities
to “strengthen and accelerate” its ability to investigate matters of concern, and to
“reinstate and reinforce” its monitoring and verification system.
382.  Dr ElBaradei had “reported on numerous occasions” that the IAEA had:
“… by December 1998 … concluded that it had neutralised Iraq’s past nuclear
programme and that therefore no unresolved disarmament issues remained …
Hence, our focus since the resumption of inspections … has been verifying whether
Iraq revived its nuclear programme in the intervening years.
“We have to date found no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related
activities in Iraq. However … a number of issues are still under investigation … we
intend to make full use of the authority granted to us … to build as much capacity
into the inspection process as necessary.
“In that context, I would underline the importance of information that States may
be able to provide to help us in assessing the accuracy and completeness of
information provided by Iraq.”
383.  Dr ElBaradei concluded that it was:
“… possible with an intrusive verification system, to assess the presence or absence
of a nuclear weapons programme … even without the full co-operation of the
inspected State.
“However, prompt, full and active co-operation by Iraq as required under resolution
1441 (2002) will speed up the process. More importantly, it will enable us to reach
the high degree of assurance required by the Security Council in the case of Iraq
248

in view of its past clandestine programmes of weapons of mass destruction and its
past pattern of co-operation. It is my hope that the commitments made recently in
Baghdad will continue to translate into concrete and sustained action.”

Security Council discussions, 14 February 2003
384.  In the discussion which followed the reports, significant differences between
members of the Security Council remained.
385.  Mr de Villepin stated that the inspectors should be given time to fulfil their
mission and a further meeting to assess the situation should be held on 14 March.
386.  France did not exclude a resort to force but it could be justified “only” if
inspections failed. The Council would “have to take a decision” if the inspectors
reported it was impossible to continue.
387.  The reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei were followed by a discussion in the
Security Council on 14 February.105
388.  The points made by Mr de Villepin included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

105 

In adopting resolution 1441 the Council had collectively agreed two stages:
“disarmament through inspections and, if this strategy should fail, consideration
by the Security Council of all the options, including resorting to force”. A second
resolution could be justified “only” if inspections failed.
France did not believe the option of inspections had “been exhausted”, it could
“provide an effective response to the imperative of disarming Iraq”.
The use of force would “have such heavy consequences for the people,
the region and international stability that it should be envisaged only
as a last resort”.
Inspections were producing results, although each member of the Council
“would like more” and pressure on Baghdad should be maintained to
achieve that.
Real progress was being made. Aerial reconnaissance had been agreed. Iraq
had allowed interviews without minders. Draft legislation barring activities linked
to programmes for weapons of mass destruction was being adopted. Iraq was
providing a list of experts who witnessed the programmes of destruction in 1991.
France had set out proposals to enhance the efficiency of inspections and would
be providing additional resources.
War might seem to be the swiftest option in ensuring Iraqi compliance, but
building peace would be long and difficult. No one could maintain that war would
“lead to a safer, more just and more stable world”; war was “always the outcome
of failure”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

The inspectors should have “the time that is necessary for their mission
to succeed”. The Council should meet again at Ministerial level, on 14 March,
to “assess the situation”.
The use of force was “not justified at this time” and “premature recourse to the
military option would be fraught with risks”. It would call the unity of the Council
into question, and that would: “… remove its legitimacy and, in the long run, its
effectiveness. Such intervention could have incalculable consequences for the
stability of a scared and fragile region. It would compound the sense of injustice,
would aggravate tensions and would risk paving the way for other conflicts.”
The priority was fighting terrorism. France had no intelligence of the links
between Al Qaida and the Baghdad regime alleged by Secretary Powell
on 5 February. Military action would exacerbate the divisions that nurtured
terrorism.
France did not exclude recourse to force if the inspectors reported that it
was “impossible for inspections to continue”. In that case, the “Council would
have to take a decision, and its members would have to shoulder all of their
responsibilities”.

389.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that Mr de Villepin’s “impassioned plea
for continued inspections” had won “unprecedented applause from the gallery”.106
390.  Mrs Alvear called for the inspections process to be continued and enhanced.
391.  Chile was dismayed by the divisions in the Council and called for a return
to co-operation and unity to achieve Iraq’s disarmament.
392.  Mrs Alvear stated that indications of progress raised “some hopes for a decisive
change of attitude” from Iraq towards the demands of the international community, but
other attitudes revealed “an intention not to co-operate” and gave rise to “suspicions
about the presence of weapons of mass destruction”.107 Iraq was not fully implementing
the resolutions and pressure on Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be maintained
“relentlessly and without relaxation”.
393.  Chile believed that the “inspections process must be continued, strengthened and
expanded to make it accurate, intrusive and capable of thwarting any effort at deception
or evasion”.
394.  The Security Council had a “key role” and Chile had “noted with dismay over the
past month a growing division within the Council”. While that was “rooted in positions”
that were “legitimately different”, it had been “fuelled by a lack of willingness to listen and
to propose”. Chile wished to contribute to a “return to the path of debate and to a method

of work that combines conviction with respect for the concerns of others, the capacity
of persuasion with tolerance and, above all, patience”. Unity of the Council was:
“… the basis of any international action that seeks to be both legitimate and
effective. Only a united Council could credibly adopt the appropriate decisions for
achieving the objective of the disarmament of the Iraqi regime.”
395.  Chile wholeheartedly accepted Mr Annan’s invitation, in a recent speech, “to take
the necessary time to continue to seek the broadest possible consensus for achieving
a comprehensive solution”. That was the only way to exhaust all means to settle the
conflict peacefully and reserve the use of force “until the moment when it becomes clear
to all that peaceful means have failed”.
396.  China also called for the pursuit of a political settlement.
397.  Mr Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese Foreign Minister, urged Iraq to recognise the
importance and urgency of inspections and to co-operate more pro-actively. China,
“in agreement with the majority opinion among Council members”, believed that the
inspections process was working. The Council had to “step up its efforts”. “Only by
pursuing a political settlement” could the Council “live up to the trust and hope that
the international community places in the Security Council”.
398.  Spain questioned Iraq’s will to co-operate.
399.  Ms Palacio pointed out that active, immediate and complete co-operation from
Iraq was not yet forthcoming and all the areas of non-compliance and unresolved issues
mentioned in Dr Blix’s report of 27 January remained. Spain saw no need for more
inspections or an increase in capability. Peace and security were “ensured through
respect for and compliance with Security Council resolutions”. If there was no change
in the political will of Saddam Hussein to co-operate, the Council would be “obliged
to assume its responsibilities in the interests of the peace and security of the world”.
400.  Mr Straw also questioned whether Iraq had decided to co-operate and stated
that Iraq’s material breaches still existed.
401.  The authority of the United Nations and the responsibility of the Council
for peace and security were at issue from Iraq’s continued defiance.
402.  The UN Charter required the diplomatic process to be backed by the credible
threat of the use of force and its use if necessary.
403.  Mr Straw thanked Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei for “their great efforts in the face
of what I think is still very clear: Iraq’s failure, fully and actively to comply with
resolution 1441”.108

108 

UN Security Council, ‘4707th Meeting Friday 14 February 2003’ (S/PV.4707).

251

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

404.  Mr Straw stated that the issue, which “could not be graver”, was “about the
authority of the United Nations and about the responsibility of the Security Council for
international peace and security”. All the members of the Council knew that Iraq had
“had these weapons [of mass destruction and long-range missiles]”; Iraq had been
“found guilty” in 1991. The issue was whether Iraq was “actively co-operating to get
rid of them”.
405.  Mr Straw stated that Iraq had lied, had concealed weapons and played games.
As Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had:
“… spelled out in their report of 27 January, Iraq has failed to account for thousands
of tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, of shells and bombs for
anthrax, for mustard gas, for VX nerve agent. They have failed to make a full and
complete disclosure as required of them … They have failed to co-operate fully
and actively on substance, as well as on process with the inspectors, and failed
substantively to meet the obligations imposed on them.”
406.  Mr Straw added:
“… nobody who has spoken so far … has suggested for a second that Iraq is fully
and actively complying with the obligations that we imposed … So Iraq’s material
breaches … are still there.”
407.  Mr Straw posed a number of questions for the inspectors including:

•	
•	
•	
•	

What were Iraq’s motives for refurbishing prohibited equipment destroyed
by UNSCOM?
How many interviews had taken place, and how many could the inspectors
be sure were not subject to Iraqi surveillance?
Had the “outstanding material identified by UNSCOM” been “satisfactorily
dealt with”?
How many “open issues” in the nuclear dossier had the IAEA been able
to close?

408.  Mr Straw stated that he interpreted Dr Blix’s report as meaning that “Iraq has yet
to be forthcoming with … immediate, active and unconditional co-operation”. Picking up
a phrase from Dr Blix’s report of 27 January, Mr Straw asked whether Dr Blix believed
Iraq had “yet come to a genuine acceptance of the disarmament that has been
demanded of it”.
409.  “Like every other member” of the Council, Mr Straw hoped and believed that
a peaceful solution to the crisis might “still be possible”. But that would require
a “dramatic and immediate change by Saddam” which would be achieved only if the
Council held its nerve.

252

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

410.  Mr Straw concluded by stating that the period since resolution 687 (1991) had
been passed had “frankly been a period of humiliation” for the Council and the UN as
“games have been played with the Council’s authority”. The Charter required the Council
to “back the diplomatic process with a credible threat of force and also, if necessary,
to be ready to use that force”. If the Council decided to:
“… back away … to give unlimited time for little or no co-operation on substance –
then the disarmament of Iraq and the peace and security of the international
community, for which we are responsible, will not get any easier, but very
much harder.
“This issue is not just about Iraq … If we send out the message to proliferators … that
defiance of the United Nations pays, then it will not be peace that we have secured.”
411.  Secretary Powell stated that the Council should consider whether it was time
to consider the serious consequences intended by resolution 1441.
412.  The points made by Secretary Powell included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The inspectors had reported progress, but it was on process not substance, and
tricks were being played by Iraq.
Resolution 1441 was about disarmament, not inspections. It stated that Iraq was
in material breach of its obligations and must now come into compliance.
The requirement in the resolution for a full, complete and accurate declaration
of its activities had been “an early test of Iraq’s seriousness; the answer in its
declaration [of 7 December] was that it was not going to co-operate”.
Connections between Iraq and terrorist organisations were “now emerging”.
We could not wait for weapons of mass destruction to show up in our cities.
The weapons “could kill tens of thousands of people” if they “got into the
wrong hands”.
If Iraq had been co-operating, documents would be flooding in and there would
be a queue of interviewees.
Iraq did not need time to decide to co-operate. Iraq’s recent actions were not
responsible, they were “continued efforts to deceive, to deny, to divert, to throw
us off the trail”.
Resolution 1441 had anticipated Iraq’s response. The improvements in process,
more inspections and a longer inspection period would not move the position
that Iraq had “failed to comply”.
The threat of force “should always be a last resort”, but it “must be a resort”.
The process could not be “endlessly strung out”, as Iraq was trying to do, until
the world’s attention moved in other directions.
Iraq could not “be allowed to get away with it again”. The Council had
to think through the consequences of walking away or the reality of facing

253

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

the problem and the choice of whether or not it was time to consider the serious
consequences intended by 1441.
413.  Secretary Powell concluded that:
“The security of the region, the hopes for the people of Iraq, and our security rest
upon us meeting our responsibilities and, if it comes to it, invoking the serious
consequences called for in resolution 1441 …”
414.  Mr Igor Ivanov stated that Iraq should be set clear tasks to provide objective
criteria by which to assess progress and the threat posed by Iraq.
415.  The debate in the Council demonstrated that remedies other than the use
of force to achieve Iraq’s disarmament had not yet been exhausted.
416.  Mr Igor Ivanov stated that the Council should be guided by the professional
data provided by the inspectors to, “without making a mistake, come to the
correct conclusion”.
417.  Substantial progress had been made and could not be ignored. The Council should
urge Baghdad to increase co-operation and the work of the inspectors “must be made
more systematic and focused”. Iraq should be set clear tasks, including through the
submission of the UNMOVIC and IAEA work programme and the list of key disarmament
tasks required by resolution 1284 (1999). Adoption of such a programme would provide
“objective criteria” to assess both the degree of Baghdad’s co-operation and whether
Iraq was “a threat to international peace and security”.
418.  Russia’s position, “shared by the overwhelming majority of States in the world,
including within the Security Council”, was that inspections “must continue”. There was:
“… a unique opportunity to reach agreement on how to solve this … problem
through political means, in strict accordance with the UN Charter. This is a real
opportunity, and it must not be missed. Force may be resorted to, but only when all
other remedies have been exhausted. As may be seen from today’s discussion, we
have not yet reached that point …”
419.  Other members of the Security Council emphasised the need for Iraq
to co-operate actively and unconditionally to disarm; the need to exhaust
the inspections route; and the importance of Council unity.
420.  Mr Luiz Derbez, the Mexican Foreign Minister, stated that the Iraqi Government
continued to evade its international responsibilities and the Council was united about the
goal of disarmament. But the Council was “increasingly divided as [to] the most effective
and least costly manner by which it may be achieved”. Mexico’s view was that the
“Security Council’s primary task” was to ensure the inspectors fulfilled their mission.

254

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

421.  Mr Mamady Traoré, Guinean Permanent Representative to the UN and President
of the Council, advocated continued inspections although they “should not be continued
indefinitely”. Guinea was “concerned at the abrupt rise in tension within the international
community” over the Iraq crisis and appealed “for a swift beginning of direct and
constructive dialogue among Security Council members so that we can move beyond
this climate of tension which could deal a harsh blow to the United Nations system”.
Iraq must “finally agree” to co-operate and end its delaying tactics.
422.  Mr Munir Akram, Pakistani Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that it was
“understandable that the patience of some important members of the Security Council
is running out”. The call in resolution 1441 “was credible because it was unanimous”.
Pakistan believed that the “Security Council must maintain this unity of purpose and
action”. It could still unite around:

•	
•	
•	

“a general preference, even at this late stage, to secure the elimination of Iraq’s
weapons of mass destruction through peaceful means”;
Iraq’s “immediate, active and unconditional co-operation”; and
“a readiness to allow more time”.

423.  Mr Martin Belinga-Eboutou, Cameroonian Permanent Representative to the
UN, stated that Cameroon wished to “emphasise … the need for the Security Council
to continue to safeguard … its unity and cohesion”. He added: “The discord, the
cacophony, indeed the confusion surrounding us in recent days can only harm our
effectiveness.” Cameroon was “in favour of a peaceful settlement” and was “trying to
take a pragmatic and realistic approach”. It had “raised the possibility of more robust
inspections” which would require Iraq’s immediate, active and complete co-operation.
It was “clear that further non-compliance by Iraq with the demands of the Security
Council would be one violation too many”, which would leave the Council with “no other
choice but to adopt, in unity and cohesion, appropriate measures to have its decisions
respected within the provisions of the Charter”.
424.  Referring to Mr Annan’s speech on 8 February, Mr Belinga-Eboutou appealed
for unity and cohesion. He stated:
“The maintenance of peace and security is a very delicate and serious mission.
It requires at all times those who are responsible for it [to] transcend their
differences and act only in the interests of peace.”
425.  Mr Ismael Gaspar Martins, Angolan Permanent Representative to the UN,
stated that the Council was unable to say that Iraq was free from weapons of mass
destruction, but:
“… we are equally unable to state unequivocally that Iraq is fully armed with
weapons of mass destruction or other weapons that pose a clear and impending
threat to international peace and security.”

255

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

426.  Mr Gaspar Martins was “confident that the Council” represented “a unified
coalition of the willing to secure international peace and security”. Whatever decision it
reached, it was “pivotal” that it was “based on convincing and far-reaching information”.
He warned that:
“Whatever decision we collectively take must be proportionate to the gravity
of the issue before us. That decision need not be popular; but it must be justified.
The consequences of a war clearly outweigh its benefits …”
427.  Mr Stefan Tafrov, Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that
Bulgaria believed that Iraq’s co-operation was “unsatisfactory” and it was unfortunate,
“as the statements made by the chief inspectors have confirmed”, that the Iraqi
authorities were “still in material breach” of resolution 1441. Bulgaria hoped that France’s
ideas would be one element of the overall Security Council strategy to disarm Iraq and
believed that that goal could still be achieved through peaceful means. But the Council
had repeatedly warned Iraq of serious consequences if it did not comply. Bulgaria
appealed to the Council to “stand united”. That was “an essential condition for a peaceful
outcome to the crisis and for averting future threats”.
428.  Mr Fischer stated that Iraq “must not be allowed to possess any weapons of mass
destruction and must disarm completely”. The inspectors had made “headway” and their
presence had “substantially diminished the danger emanating from Iraq”. They “must be
given the time to successfully complete their mission”. That required Iraq to co-operate
fully, unconditionally and actively if a “looming tragedy” was to be averted.
429.  Mr Fischer concluded:
“All possible means for resolving the Iraqi crisis by peaceful means must be
thoroughly explored. Whatever decisions need to be made must be made by the
Security Council alone. It remains the only body internationally authorised to do so.
“Military action against Iraq would, in addition to the terrible humanitarian
consequences, above all endanger the stability of a tense and troubled region.
The consequences for the Near and Middle East could be catastrophic. There should
be no automatism leading to the use of military force. All possible alternatives need
to be exhaustively explored.”
430.  Iraq continued to state that it did not possess weapons of mass destruction.
431.  Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had agreed to act on resolution 1441 and had “provided
everything that might fall within the concept of pro-active Iraqi co-operation”. The
documents provided with the Iraqi declaration of 7 December 2002, required “in-depth
study” because they contained “updated relevant information responding to many
questions”. Iraq had “the right to wonder whether the declaration had been studied with
due diligence and thoroughness”. Iraq had “begun to co-operate pro-actively”, and many
speakers had called for that but there was a question about what that would mean.

256

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

432.  Mr Aldouri pointed out that there was an “Arabic proverb that an empty hand
has nothing to give. You cannot give what you do not have. If we do not possess such
weapons, how can we disarm ourselves? How can such weapons be dismantled if they
do not exist?”
433.  Iraq agreed that the “best way to resolve these issues is through continuing
pro‑active co-operation with the inspectors”. Mr Aldouri stressed that Iraq had:
“… chosen the path of peace. We have opted for solutions that would satisfy the
international community. We are prepared to provide all means to assist in making
clear the true picture …
“We hope the Security Council will heed the desire of the vast majority of States
Members of the United Nations and allow the inspectors to fulfil their role …”
434.  In the subsequent private discussion, Mr Straw stated that there was
overwhelming evidence that Iraq had had WMD; if there was no evidence to show
that it had been destroyed, we had to work on the basis that it existed.
435.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in response to points raised during the
private session of the Council:

•	

•	
•	

Dr Blix had clarified that it was too soon to say whether Iraq had come to a
genuine acceptance of the disarmament required – there were some signs but
no break through. Interviews were a mixed bag. In reality, the inspectors had
had no one accept their conditions, though some people they had asked had
subsequently come back and accepted. The Iraqi decree on WMD did not say
anything about what Iraq would do in practice. UNMOVIC had expanded as
much as it could; if it expanded too fast, there was a risk of mistakes.
Dr ElBaradei had voiced concerns about Iraq’s approach to interviews
and emphasised the importance of inspections as the cornerstone of the
international disarmament regime. He had also questioned whether Iraq needed
reassurance that a new item would not be regarded as a material breach.
Mr Straw had stated that the reason that the Council had said Iraq’s WMD posed
a threat was because there was overwhelming evidence that Iraq had had the
material. If we had no evidence it had been destroyed, we had to work on the
basis that it existed and that there was a danger to the region and to our national
security. Oral cross-examination was the best way to get the truth. Interviewees
were not saying anything and were insisting on tape recorders because they
wanted to stay alive. Until Iraq allowed interviews outside Iraq and in free
conditions, we would be naive to think that they were co-operating.

257

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

Ms Palacio commented that “Iraqi progress had always been last minute and
under pressure”. In her legal experience, she had “never seen a situation were
[sic] witnesses did not speak freely unless they were threatened”.
Secretary Powell questioned whether those who advocated reinforced
inspections were serious or afraid to step up to the challenge of Iraq’s lack
of compliance”.109

436.  Sir Jeremy commented that Dr Blix’s report was much more equivocal than that
of 27 January. His, and Dr ElBaradei’s, answers in the closed session were:
“… more indicative of their underlying suspicions, as though they knew their
prepared remarks had over-compensated. Tough exchanges with the Americans
the day before may have made Blix more determined to assert his independence.
“We have to go on hammering away at the logic of SCR 1441: it is about Iraq’s
approach, and not the inspections … When the Council middle ground … realise
they have to face up to hard and final decisions, they may take more account
of the responsibility they hold. So far, wishful procrastination continues to rule.”
437.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that, following his report on 27 January,
Dr Blix had “got a bit cross” with the US because they felt that might in itself amount
to a material breach. As a result, in his report on 14 February, Dr Blix had:
“… within the scope that he felt he had for interpretation … said, ‘They are actually
beginning to cooperate … So I feel I’m getting somewhere.’ The Americans were
quite cross about that …”110
438.  Sir Jeremy added that, “in the lunch after”, Dr Blix “was tougher on the Iraqis and
their lack of co-operation in private than he had been in public, and it was clear from my
conversations with him … that … was affected by the reaction of the Americans to what
he had said on 27 January”.
439.  Asked if that was because Dr Blix did not want to provide an automatic trigger
for action, Sir Jeremy replied: “Yes”.
440.  Asked what Dr Blix had said about pressure from the US or UK, Sir Jeremy replied:
“Hans Blix complained more than once to me about the pressures from the
Americans. … [H]e felt the relationship with the British was much more reasonable
and professional and we weren’t trying to distort the facts for political reasons.
“… I never heard a word of complaint from him about the pressure being put on him
by the British …”111

441.  Mr Annan concluded that there were real differences on strategy and timing
in the Security Council. Iraq’s non-co-operation was insufficient to bring members
to agree that war was justified; they would only move if they came to their own
judgement that inspections were pointless.
442.  The UKMIS New York record of a meeting between Mr Straw and Mr Annan
reported that they had discussed the fact that the majority of Council members
remained unpersuaded by the US and UK arguments.112 The strong probability of
Iraqi non-co-operation was not sufficient to bring them to agree that war was justified.
There were real differences on strategy and timing and Council members would only
move if they came to their own judgement that inspections were pointless.
443.  Mr Straw had commented that Saddam Hussein’s behaviour would be quite
different if he really had zero WMD. The UK and US would look at the timing of a
second resolution. The Council was more likely to be brought to a decision if we stuck
to the game plan, but we also had to do the political arithmetic. The Americans would
find it difficult to move forward if the Council majority really believed the inspections
were working.
444.  A separate record produced by the FCO reported that Mr Straw had commented
that the public saw 200,000 troops in the region and heard belligerent language and
thought we were determined to go to war tomorrow without good reason.113 He and
Mr Annan had discussed the need to keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein; and
that the threat of force could be more effective than its use. There was a possibility of
building a consensus with time but if the pace was forced there was a risk of one or
more vetoes. The problem was that the burden of evidence had shifted to those who
wanted military action. The fact that resolution 1441 required Iraqi compliance was lost.
Time was needed to get people to look at things differently, but different countries faced
different time pressures. American time was very expensive; others felt it was natural to
ask for more time. When asked to define “a little time”, Dr Blix had answered “one year”.
445.  Asked by the Inquiry whether, after the report on 27 January, he had expected
Dr Blix to be firm in his determination of a material breach, Mr Blair stated:
“… the whole point was that his [Dr Blix’s] view was that Iraq was complying
somewhat, but not fully and unconditionally, and as time went on, I became
increasingly alarmed … that we were just back into a game-playing situation with
Saddam … I think it is very clear from what we now know that he never had any
intention of his people co‑operating fully with the inspectors.”114

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

446.  Asked if he had been disappointed by Dr Blix’s report of 14 February,
Mr Blair replied:
“It wasn’t that I was disappointed. I was getting confused as to what he was
really trying to tell us … what particularly struck me … and this then had a huge
significance in what I then tried … to construct a final way of avoiding the war, is,
on page 26 of his briefing, he deals with the issue of interviews and he says that
the Iraqi side … are starting to move on interviews … they have made a commitment
that they will allow it, but then, when he actually comes to the interviews themselves,
people are reluctant …”115

Mr Blair’s speech to the Labour Party conference, 15 February 2003
447.  Mr Blair used his speech to the Labour Party conference on 15 February to
continue to link the timetable for decisions on Iraq to a judgement about whether
Iraq had decided to co-operate as required by resolution 1441.
448.  Mr Blair also continued to emphasise the moral case for removing
Saddam Hussein.
449.  On 15 February, as part of a weekend of worldwide protests against military action
in Iraq, a march organised by the Stop the War Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain took place in London. The police
described it as the UK’s biggest ever demonstration, estimating that at least 750,000
people took part. The organisers put the figure closer to two million. There were also
anti-war gatherings in Glasgow and Belfast.116
450.  In the entry in his diaries for 13 February, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had
decided to focus on a humanitarian theme to “at least give the marchers something
to think about and something to put them on the defensive”.117
451.  Mr Campbell wrote the following day that Mr Blair had said Dr Blix’s presentation
was “a total disgrace, that he should have just told the truth, and the truth was Saddam
was not co-operating”. Mr Blair was in “a tough place”, but “showed no signs of changing
tack … said we were doing the right thing. But whether we liked it or not, we were
moving towards a regime change argument.” Mr Blair “felt we had to make more of the
moral case but we agreed we could not really set out the forward plan he had devised
on the back of this, because it would look like weakness …”

452.  In the entry in his memoir for 14 February, Mr Cook wrote:
“The news from New York is electrifying. The latest report by Hans Blix registers a
lot of progress in co-operation from Iraq, fails to identify any evidence of weapons
of mass destruction and expresses confidence that with more time more progress
can be made. What Hans Blix was in effect confirming was that the UK strategy of
applying pressure on Saddam to co-operate on disarmament, through the dual track
of inspectors on the ground and the threat of force across his border, is working
rather well.”118
453.  Mr Cook added his view that Mr Blair needed the inspectors:
“… to prove that Saddam will not co-operate and that he is therefore justified
in going to war … The ghastly dilemma he now faces is that without Hans Blix
denouncing Saddam, there is little chance of getting a majority in the Security
Council for military conflict, and therefore even less chance of getting a majority of
the British people.”
454.  In his speech to the Labour Party conference in Glasgow on 15 February, Mr Blair
stated that the Labour Party would come through an uncertain time by holding firm to its
beliefs and the United Nations was one of those beliefs. He wanted:
“… to solve the issue of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction through the UN.
That is why last November we insisted on putting UN inspectors back into Iraq
to disarm it.
“Dr Blix reported to the UN yesterday and there will be more time given to
inspections. He will report again on 28 February. But let no one forget two things.
To anyone familiar with Saddam’s tactics of deception and evasion, there is a weary
sense of déjà vu. As ever, at the last minute concessions are made. And as ever it
is the long finger that is directing them. The concessions are suspect. Unfortunately,
the weapons are real.”119
455.  Mr Blair continued that the inspections regime in resolution 1441 was tough
because for 12 years Saddam Hussein had played a “game with the inspectors” and:
“The time needed is not the time it takes for the inspectors to discover the weapons.
They are not a detective agency. We played that game for years in the 1990s. The
time is the time necessary to make a judgement: is Saddam prepared to co-operate
fully or not. If he is, the inspectors can take as much time as they want. If he is not,
if this is a repeat of the 1990s – and I believe it is – then let us be in no doubt what
is at stake.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“By going down the UN route we gave the UN an extraordinary opportunity and
a heavy responsibility. The opportunity is to show that we can meet the menace
to our world together … The responsibility, however, is indeed to deal with it.”
456.  Referring to the failure of the League of Nations, Mr Blair stated:
“… Saddam would not be making a single concession without the knowledge
that forces were gathering against him. I hope, even now, Iraq can be disarmed
peacefully, with or without Saddam. But if we show weakness now, if we allow the
plea for more time to become just an excuse for prevarication until the moment for
action passes, then it will not only be Saddam who is repeating history. The menace,
and not just from Saddam, will grow; the authority of the UN will be lost; and the
conflict when it comes will be more bloody. Yes, let the United Nations be the way
to deal with Saddam. But let the United Nations mean what it says; and do what
it means.”
457.  Referring to the threats posed by the proliferation of WMD and the threat
from terrorism and their potential consequences, as well as Iraq’s past behaviour,
Mr Blair stated:
“That is why Saddam and Weapons of Mass Destruction are important.
“Every time I have asked us to go to war, I have hated it …
“At every stage, we should seek to avoid war. But if the threat cannot be removed
peacefully, please let us not fall for the delusion that it can be safely ignored. If we
do not confront these twin menaces of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism,
they will not disappear …
“When people say if you act, you will provoke these people … remember that
Al Qaida attacked the US …
“… Everyone agrees Saddam must be disarmed …
“No-one seriously believes he is yet co-operating fully. In all honesty, most people
don’t really believe he ever will … It’s not really an issue of timing … It is a moral
purpose, and I respect that.
“… I abhor the consequences of war.”
458.  Addressing the question of why he pressed “the case so insistently”, Mr Blair
stated that he had set out:
“… the “geo political reason – the threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its link
with terrorism. And I believe it.
“If I am honest about it there is another reason why I feel so strongly …

262

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

“The moral case against war has a moral answer: it is the moral case for removing
Saddam. It is not the reason we act. That must be according to the United Nations
mandate on weapons of mass destruction. But it is the reason, frankly, why if we
do have to act, we should do so with a clear conscience.
“Yes, there are consequences of war. If we remove Saddam by force, people will die
and some will be innocent. And we must live with the consequences of our actions,
even the unintended ones.
“But there are also consequences of ‘stop the war’.
“If I … did not insist on disarmament … there would be no war. But there would still
be Saddam … ruling the Iraqi people …
“This isn’t a regime with weapons of mass destruction that is otherwise benign.
This is a regime that contravenes every single principle or value anyone of our
politics believes in.
“There will be no march for the victims of Saddam …
“I rejoice that we live in a country where peaceful process is a natural part of the
democratic process …
“I do not seek unpopularity as a badge of honour. But sometimes it is the price
of leadership. And the cost of conviction.”
459.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair’s speech was heard “in near silence … It was well
received, not least because it was so serious”. Mr Blair had been “confident and felt we
had the right argument and we now needed a big strategy to put the case properly”.120
460.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that he had been determined that “people should
not be able to hide from the ghastly reality of Saddam continuing in power”.121

Decisions on the way forward
461.  After the discussions in the Security Council on 14 February, Dr Blix
proposed consideration of a “benchmark approach” using “clusters” of issues
being identified as part of the work programme required by resolution 1284.
462.  Mr Straw spoke briefly to Dr Blix about the next steps after the presentation
on 14 February. The report of the discussion stated that Dr Blix:

•	
•	

had decided that Iraq had to destroy the (Volga) missile engines;
did not think it worth pursuing any ultimatum which required Saddam to quit Iraq;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•

was compiling a list of explicit questions about outstanding issues to “pin the
Iraqis down”;
was looking at establishing a No-Fly Zone for the whole of Iraq; and
was looking at freezing movements in certain areas to improve the chances
of catching a mobile “bio-lab”.122

463.  Dr Blix recorded that he told both Mr Straw and Secretary Powell about the
document being prepared by UNMOVIC, as required by resolution 1284 (1999), which
“contained ‘clusters’ of unresolved issues and indicated precisely what was required of
Iraq” that could be used “as a basis for selecting key disarmament tasks for the work
programme” in a “‘benchmark’ approach”.123 Mr Straw and Secretary Powell were both
“most interested” in the idea.
464.  Dr Blix discussed the idea with both Dr Rice and Secretary Powell over the next
two days. When he asked whether a deadline of 15 April was acceptable, Secretary
Powell said that was too late.
465.  Dr Blix also wrote that there was a lack of smoking guns that would impress the
public; and that the British “who were most fervently in favour of a resolution embodying
an ultimatum” had felt the resistance stiffen and “came to think that a change of focus
might help. The new resolution could demand a declaration by Saddam showing that
he had had a change of heart.”
466.  Mr Straw and Sir David Manning agreed with Secretary Powell and Dr Rice
that, over the next few days, the US and UK should reflect on what the next steps
should be.
467.  Sir David Manning suggested that military action should not start before
late March.
468.  Discussing the next steps with Secretary Powell after the Council discussion,
Mr Straw raised the possibility of issuing an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and
expressed caution on the timing of a second resolution. The US and UK had been
on the back foot all day and needed to be clear about how they intended to play the
end game before it began.124
469.  Sir David Manning and Dr Rice agreed on 14 February to reflect over the next two
to three days on what the next move at the UN should be, including an ultimatum.125
Stressing that he was speaking personally, Sir David suggested that one possibility

would be to use the French demand for a further meeting in a month to ask for another
report from Dr Blix. It would also be important to leave time for an initiative to persuade
Saddam to leave. That would mean delaying the start of military action until late March.
470.  The British Embassy Washington reported that the US Administration
was disappointed with Dr Blix’s less than categorical verdict on Iraqi compliance.126
A White House spokesman had downplayed the importance of the new avenues of
co-operation identified by Dr Blix. The meeting had made securing a second resolution
more difficult, but the Administration was determined to press ahead.
471.  In the light of the position in the Security Council and the perception
that the US would push for a vote by the end of February, FCO and No.10
officials proposed using the French proposal for a Ministerial discussion
on 14 March to provide a deadline for a report from the inspectors on whether
Iraq was co‑operating.
472.  Mr Ricketts wrote to Mr Straw on 15 February stating: “I know you want to cogitate
over the weekend about how we adjust strategy.” He set out the FCO’s thinking “about
how we might rally opinion in the Council through some version of an ultimatum and
more time to give it effect”.127
473.  Mr Ricketts sent Mr Straw a minute from Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle
East and North Africa, of 13 February and a minute from Mr Stephen Pattison, FCO
Head of the UN Department, which set out ways to make specific demands of Iraq.
474.  Mr Chaplin had written that it was:
“… probably the last opportunity to reflect on whether we can extract … a better
outcome … than at present looks likely.
“The mood in Washington points to early tabling of a second SCR and a quick drive
to adoption. At best this will secure 9-10 positive votes and 5-6 abstentions. There
is a substantial risk … that the text will be vetoed, at which point the US … will go
for military action … I cannot imagine the Prime Minister then refusing to follow.
“… No SCR and a feeble, at best, legal basis for military action is a nightmare
scenario. The domestic consequences (and increased risk of terrorism to British
citizens and staff) are daunting enough for Ministers. But the … longer term damage
to UK interests would be more severe because longer lasting. The image of the
UK, lone ally […] of a rampant US in its assault on Iraq, will be the touchstone for
Arab and Muslim attitudes for a generation – this is the real Suez effect. A quick
collapse of the Iraqi regime (quite likely); subsequent clear proof, because we

find the stuff, that we were right all along about the Iraqi WMD threat (questionable –
what convinces the experts may not convince public opinion unless it is pretty
spectacular); and a smooth transfer to a democratic and stable government
(improbable, especially without UN cover) would reduce the damage. But this
is a high risk route.
“Before we go down this route, we should have a last look at alternatives,
as Jeremy Greenstock is urging.”128
475.  Mr Chaplin suggested that the UK should consider a deal with France, Germany
and Russia, insisting on full Iraqi compliance with a short list of key disarmament
tasks, backed by the maximum number of inspectors and increased air surveillance,
with a short deadline (15 March). There should be a signal in advance that, short of
full compliance, the five Permanent Members of the Security Council (P5) would vote
for an “all necessary means” text. This would come into force 10 days after the passage
of a Security Council resolution to give time for the Arabs to persuade Saddam Hussein
to stand down. The “goal would be one more last chance for Saddam Hussein”.
476.  Mr Chaplin and Mr Ricketts had agreed that the latter would discuss the idea with
Mr Straw on their way to New York on 14 February.
477.  Mr Pattison suggested two options to attract support from the “middle ground
members”:

•	
•	

encouraging Dr Blix to set specific tasks to demonstrate Iraqi compliance,
building on his own ideas; or
the Security Council to set specific tasks for Iraq with a deadline.129

478.  There would be difficulties with both approaches. The problem with the first option
would lie in “getting the US to accept further delay and the likelihood that Iraq would do
just enough to provoke future wrangling over the extent of their compliance”. In addition,
the US might be hesitant about giving Dr Blix a greater role. The problem with the
second option was that it “would create an expectation that the UNSC would need
to take a further decision to authorise serious consequences and we would expect Iraq
to do just enough to split the Council”.
479.  Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw:
“Each variant had pros and cons. The main difficulty could well be to bring the
Americans to accept any specific ultimatum given the scope it would leave for Iraq
to gain more time through minor concessions.”130

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

480.  Mr Ricketts wrote that he and Sir David Manning had discussed a variant of
the approach Sir David had set out in his conversation with Dr Rice on 14 February.
That was to use the French proposal for a ministerial discussion in the Security
Council on 14 March to provide a deadline for asking Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to
state whether Iraq was “in full and active co-operation”, including a demand that Iraq
destroy its prohibited rocket motors, which would then be taken as the basis for a
resolution. Dr Rice’s initial reaction had been maybe, but she had wanted a deadline of
28 February. Mr Ricketts and Sir David thought that was too soon and would not allow
sufficient time to rally middle-ground opinion. A 14 March deadline “should still fit with
other time lines and demonstrate that we are listening to those who call for more time”.
481.  Mr Ricketts conceded that the proposal was “not a brilliant strategy” but it “might
be a way forward avoiding signals of weakness”.
482.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that more time would be needed and that
the inspectors should be given the chance to deliver a judgement which would
convince the Council.
483.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the UK could table a resolution the following
week.131 The existing version would “not get nine votes, but it will signal the beginning
of the end game and Council minds will have to concentrate within a harder context”.
In his view, the “Best area for plan B options” was “some kind of loaded ultimatum”.
484.  Sir Jeremy’s view was that postponing the discussion to 14 March would not
be sufficient to secure support: “If the judgement is left to Blix, e.g. to say whether or
not Iraq has co-operated ‘immediately, actively and unconditionally’”, he “may not be
capable of taking the heat or Council members may try to alter the terms in their favour”.
485.  There would also be a problem with the US. Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador
Negroponte had told him that President Bush would not agree to anything which
changed the terms of 1441 (especially OP2), or altered their current legal foundation
for action, or ensnared the Council in endless argument about interpretation. The
current US thinking was to table their draft mid-week and to set a date (probably the
end of February) for a vote.
486.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte “in general terms”
that more would be needed:
“Ideally, we should not move to the use of force without a find, a smoking gun.
We should maximise the possibilities for that. We should expose the French
reinforcement proposals as clearly inadequate for the disarmament of Iraq: indeed,
no proposition other than war has yet been made which will realistically achieve that –
something I said in terms to EU HOMS [Heads of Mission] meeting this morning.”

131

267

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

487.  Sir Jeremy suggested that elements in the ultimatum should “either test the
French idea to destruction … or give the inspectors a real chance to deliver a judgement
which will convince six more Council members”. Dr Blix could play a role: “There
should be room to move him to a firmer approach which raises the chances of the
inspectors achieving more.” Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was interested in ideas
for more vigorous inspections “though downbeat about the amount of time available
from the US”.
488.  Sir Jeremy concluded:
“If we and the US are true to our pronouncements of force as a last resort, bringing
the Americans back to their mid-September approach as a last gasp before pressing
the plunger at least has a certain logical force.”
489.  Sir David Manning proposed a resolution setting a deadline of 14 March for
Saddam Hussein to demonstrate that he was complying fully with resolution 1441,
after which he would be in further material breach.
490.  Sir David envisaged that military action would not begin until late March,
giving 10 days for Arab leaders to persuade Saddam Hussein to depart.
491.  The resolution should specify what compliance meant. That would set
the bar at a level it would be difficult for Saddam Hussein to reach and prevent
equivocation in the inspectors’ reports.
492.  France would seek to block the resolution and to string out inspections
indefinitely.
493.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair on 16 February that Dr Blix’s careful “fence
sitting” in his report to the Security Council had:
“… encouraged the wishful thinkers and procrastinators. For the moment, there
is almost certainly a Security Council majority for letting the inspections run, not
for moving to early military action.”132
494.  Sir David advised that it would be necessary “to go on making the argument that
the issue is compliance. Our best bet may be to concede a little more time while issuing
an ultimatum.”
495.  Sir David set out a proposal along the lines suggested by Mr Ricketts to Mr Straw,
including a second resolution “stipulating that unless Blix reports on 14 March that
Saddam is in full, unqualified, unequivocal compliance with 1441, he will be in further
material breach”. There would then be an immediate vote after Dr Blix reported.

268

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

496.  Sir David suggested that, subject to advice from Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK
might “spell out, either in the resolution or orally … that full compliance includes:

•	
•	
•	

explaining satisfactorily what happened to all the BW and CW unaccounted
for when UNSCOM were forced out of Iraq in 1998;
full and unfettered access to, and co-operation from […] who were allegedly
involved in the destruction of Iraq’s chemical stocks;
full and unfettered access to, and co-operation from, all scientists UNMOVIC
wished to interview both inside and outside Iraq, as provided for in
UNSCR 1441.”

497.  Sir David added that those “conditions set the bar too high for compliance, yet are
fundamental to it”. Dr Blix would “find it hard to pretend otherwise, whatever marginal
improvements Saddam may go on making on process as opposed to substance”.
498.  In tabling the resolution, the UK:
“… should emphasise that we are giving the French the extra time they want; and
we are taking Blix at his word … ‘inspections could still be short if immediate, active
and unconditional co-operation … were to be forthcoming’.”
499.  Sir David identified a number of disadvantages:
“•	 The Americans will dislike it. As usual they are in a hurry. But the military
timetable can be adjusted if necessary. It would probably mean action in the last
few days of March i.e. after a vote on the second resolution on 15 March and
a further 10 days for the Arabs to press Saddam to leave.

•	
•	

Blix will dislike having to make a categoric judgement … We must draft the
resolution so that he cannot equivocate and cannot honestly give a verdict
of full compliance.
The French … will work to block it. Their game is to string things out
indefinitely …”

500.  Sir David also identified the advantages:
“•	 It gives us another month to find our secure nine votes. We can claim that we
have been reasonable; four months on from 1441 no-one should seriously
argue that it is impossible to tell if Saddam is complying. A deadline will also
focus minds …

•	
•	

We have another four weeks in which the inspectors just might get lucky.
A real find would have a major impact on Security Council opinion …
It will give Saddam four more weeks to make a mistake. He may do so, perhaps
reacting badly if Blix announces later this week that the Iraqis must destroy their
Al Samoud 2 missiles with their costly engines. If Saddam refuses to co-operate,
it will be a glaring example of Iraqi non-compliance.”

269

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

501.  Sir David concluded that it was “impossible to be certain” that the strategy would
work, “but it gives us a chance. The odds are against a successful second resolution
at the end of February … an extra couple of weeks could make the difference.”
502.  Sir David advised “saying nothing” until after the European Council, allowing
France a little more time, then hitting them with the draft resolution “probably
in mid-week”. Before that, Mr Blair would “need to do a heavy selling job” with
President Bush.
503.  Mr Blair agreed the proposals were worth exploring and asked for advice,
particularly on the proposed “tests” for Iraq’s compliance.
504.  Mr Blair agreed that the ideas in Sir David Manning’s advice of 16 February were
worth exploring.133 That is addressed later in this Section.
505.  Mr Straw was told that President Bush believed Mr Blair would commit
troops if the US took unilateral action.
506.  Mr Straw discussed developments with Secretary Powell twice on 16 February.
507.  In the first conversation at 1pm, Mr Straw set out his “emerging thinking”,
including the suggestion that a meeting might be held on 14 March at which Dr Blix
and Dr ElBaradei would be asked to report if Iraq was “actively and fully co-operating,
perhaps against a checklist”.134 Mr Straw added that he thought that Dr Blix:
“… would try to avoid responsibility for this. But whilst a further material breach and
what we did about it were matters for the Security Council, saying whether Iraq
was or was not co-operating had initially to be a matter for the inspectors since
the information … was theirs. After all, it was Blix’s statement … about further
co‑operation … on process which had put us on the back foot.”
508.  In a discussion about the content of any checklist, Mr Straw said that it was
important it:
“… did not become a ‘tick in the box for compliance’, but rather good evidence of
compliance and it had to be very comprehensive, so that if he [Saddam Hussein] did
all these things he was complying in reality.”
509.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell agreed that if Saddam Hussein was faced with a
choice, for example, of whether to destroy missile engines and the survival of his regime,
he would choose the latter. Mr Straw added that:
“… since the objective of HMG’s policy was … the disarmament of Iraq’s WMD if
possible by peaceful means, clear and continuing evidence of Saddam’s compliance

on substance would be bound to negate the case for the UK’s involvement
in military action.”
510.  Secretary Powell was reported to have responded that he understood that:
“… but he was not sure that was where President Bush was. He might still be
inclined to ‘go it alone’ for the removal of Saddam and the President believed that
the Prime Minister would commit British troops in any event.”
511.  Mr Straw said that Mr Blair’s “personal loyalty to the President was never in doubt;
but that alone would not answer the question whether there was adequate legal and
political justification for UK military involvement”.
512.  In response to Secretary Powell’s comment that he assumed the demonstration
on 15 February made a second resolution “even more necessary”, Mr Straw replied:
“… yes. If there were nine votes or more in the Security Council for a second
resolution, and this majority was subject to a veto by one only of the P5, I thought
we could carry the day in the Commons and the country but there would have
to be … clear evidence of substantive non-compliance by Iraq of 1441. Without
the latter, we could have no chance. Regime change per se had never been the
objective of HMG’s strategy however desirable it was.”
513.  Mr Straw added that:
“… even with a second resolution (or a majority and a veto but good case) the
political and public order consequences of the early stages of military action on
current plans would be hard to handle: without a very strong case, consistent with
our clear, already stated objectives, they could become unmanageable. Unless we
were very lucky, military action without an effective international consensus could
severely damage US as well as UK interests.”
514.  In a discussion of the timing for a second resolution, Mr Powell said he was still
thinking about tabling a resolution that week but stating that a vote was not being asked
for immediately. Mr Straw pointed out the disadvantages for the UK while Parliament
was in recess, adding that tabling a resolution without any commitment for an early vote
would be seen as a sign of weakness. It might also make it harder to secure the votes
of the elected members of the Council. It might also be seen as ignoring the outcome
of the inspectors’ reports on 28 February.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

515.  In their second conversation at 8.30pm, following a conversation between Dr Blix
and Secretary Powell, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell considered a list of particular
issues which could be used to judge compliance.135 Those need not be specified
in the resolution but could include:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles;
a push on interviews;
control of road traffic;
control of the Syrian pipeline; and
legitimisation of existing No-Fly Zones and their potential extension to cover
all of Iraq.

516.  The bar would need to be set high enough to ensure that there really was
compliance. Dr Blix had suggested a deadline of 15 April, which Secretary Powell
said “would be difficult for the US”, though it fitted with the deadline Mr Blair had
“originally suggested”.
517.  Secretary Powell also suggested that there would be a presentational problem for
President Bush if Saddam complied, and that “He would be unhappy publicly, but almost
certainly relieved in private.”

European Council, 17 February 2003
518.  On behalf of the European Union, the Greek Presidency had delivered a demarche
to Iraq on 4 February stating that it was “deeply concerned” about the crisis and that time
was “running out”. It called on Iraq “fully, unconditionally and immediately” to comply with
all resolutions and to co-operate pro-actively with the inspectors. If Iraq did not comply,
it would “carry the responsibilities for all the consequences”.136
519.  Mr Blair wrote to Mr Simitis,137 other EU Heads of State and Government,
Mr Romano Prodi, the President of the European Commission, and Mr Javier Solana,
the Secretary General of the Council of the European Union, on 12 February, welcoming
the decision to call an extraordinary European Council on 17 February and proposing
that the 10 new EU Accession Partners and three candidate countries should also be
invited “given their interests”.138

520.  Recognising that the debate would need to “take full account” of Dr Blix
and Dr ElBaradei’s reports to the Security Council on 27 January and 14 February,
Mr Blair set out a number of elements that “might form the basis for our debate
and the conclusions we draw”. Those included:

•	

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

Reaffirming the EU position agreed at the 27 January meeting of the General
Affairs and External Relations Committee (GAERC), “particularly the full
implementation of UNSCR 1441 to achieve the objective of Iraqi disarmament
of all its WMD. Iraq must comply fully, actively, immediately and unconditionally
with its international obligations”.
Clarity about the implications of resolution 1441. OP2 had given Iraq a final
opportunity to comply: “But Saddam had not taken that opportunity. His false
statements and omissions in the December declaration and failure to cooperate fully with the inspectors are a material breach of the resolution [OP4]”.
So, as OP13 made “explicit”, Saddam faced “serious consequences”.
Military action was a last resort, but the Council “must make it clear that no
Member State rules it out if needed to uphold the authority of the Security
Council. We should also be clear that in the absence of full and immediate
co‑operation, the UNSC should move quickly to a second resolution.”
Maintaining and increasing the pressure on Saddam: “Time is now running very
short. There is still a last opportunity for Saddam to co-operate unconditionally
with the international community’s demands or to leave. But failing that, we
should be clear Saddam faces immediate and serious consequences.”
The EU should ensure it was ready to contribute to humanitarian and
reconstruction issues.
Addressing the regional implications of the crisis by “underlining … the
importance we attach to early progress towards a lasting settlement between
Israelis and Palestinians on the basis of the Road Map”.

521.  Mr Straw wrote to his Cabinet colleagues on 14 February, reiterating the point
he had made in Cabinet on 6 February, about the importance of maintaining contacts
with members of the Security Council in “the crucial period leading up to consideration
of a new resolution on Iraq”.139 The position of the 10 elected Members of the Security
Council (the E10)140 would be crucial.
522.  Mr Blair discussed Iraq, including the different expectations of what would
constitute a material breach and the time required to bring people together and avoid
further polarisation, with Mr Annan on 16 February.141 Mr Blair said the time required
was the time needed to “make a judgement on whether Iraq was co-operating”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

523.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that, at the No.10 morning meeting
on 17 February, Mr Blair “was keen on a major upgrade of our communications
and believed we could win the argument as set out at the weekend”.142
524.  An extraordinary meeting of the European Council to discuss Iraq on
17 February pledged “full support” to Security Council efforts and to work with
partners, “especially the United States”, to disarm Iraq.
525.  Mr Annan appealed for transatlantic unity and patient persuasive diplomacy
behind closed doors. The UN would be seriously weakened if action was taken
without its authority.
526.  The discussion of Foreign Ministers addressed the objective of disarmament
rather than regime change, the need for a second resolution whilst the inspections were
continuing, the consequences of military action, and the role of the EU, its relationship
with the US and its credibility.143
527.  Mr Straw said:
“… what was at stake was the future of multilateralism in a unipolar world. France
emphasised the power of words but not the power of action. Europe was very
multilateralist in decision-making but not so when it came to action. There were
essentially three fundamental issues involved: Iraq remained a threat to international
security; the only reason that inspections were taking place was because of military
pressure on Saddam; and Iraq was not complying. The EU would not be having this
discussion unless the US and the UK were willing to pay for this military build up and
put their troops on the line. They could not stay there forever but that did not mean
that events were being driven by a military timetable.”
528.  Mr Annan’s address to the Council was reported as “uncompromising in putting
the onus on Saddam to implement resolution 1441; and to implement it swiftly”.144
If the Security Council managed the current crisis successfully, it would emerge with
its authority enhanced. But if it failed, and action was taken without its authority, the UN
would be seriously weakened. If Iraq were allowed to defy the Security Council because
the international community failed to impose itself, the foundations of collective security
would be gravely undermined. An effective international security system depended
on the Council and on its determination to take action in even the most difficult cases.
529.  Mr Annan had appealed for transatlantic unity and patient persuasive diplomacy
behind closed doors to build a common front. The greater the degree of consensus

in dealing with Iraq, the greater the chance of resolving other crises, particularly
Israel/Palestine.
530.  In the discussion over dinner, Mr Blair said there were three issues at stake:

•	

•	

•	

The authority of the UN. That was set out in resolution 1441 passed after
twelve years of Iraqi prevarication. The UN had made clear this was a final
opportunity requiring full compliance. In neither the December declaration nor
Dr Blix’s reports to the Security Council in January and February was there any
sign of full compliance on substance. If there were 100 percent Iraqi compliance,
the inspectors could take as long as they needed. But the inspectors were not
supposed to be a detective agency. Co-operation was key. If we were not careful
we would be back in the situation we were in in the nineties.
Iraq’s WMD. There was no intelligence agency of any member state which
did not know Iraq possessed these weapons. It was true that conflict meant
bloodshed. But it was not true that the absence of conflict meant the absence of
bloodshed. Thousands of Iraqis were dying under Saddam Hussein. Four million
were in exile. The rate of Iraqi infant mortality in areas outside Saddam’s control
was a quarter of that in areas under Baghdad’s rule.
EU/US relations. Iraq had to be resolved in a way which met the objective of
maintaining EU/US relations. That did not mean the EU had to do things simply
because the US wanted. The way Europe handled Iraq would have profound
implications for generations to come. The key was to ensure resolution 1441
was implemented. “The UN had to be the way of dealing with this issue, not
a way of avoiding it.”145

531.  The Council statement agreed at the dinner left the decision on inspectors’ time
and resources to the UN Security Council and made it clear that immediate action was
needed by Iraq.146 It was seen by the media as more robust than expected.
532.  The statement said that the European Council was “determined to deal effectively
with the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction”; and that it was
“committed to the United Nations remaining at the centre of the international order”.
The European Council recognised that “the primary responsibility for dealing with Iraqi
disarmament lies with the Security Council”; and it pledged its “full support”. It wanted
to achieve disarmament peacefully, and that was what the people of Europe wanted:
“War is not inevitable. Force should only be used as a last resort. It is for the Iraqi regime
to end this crisis …”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

533.  The European Council reiterated its:
“… full support for the … work of the UN inspectors. They must be given the
time and resources that the UN Security Council believes they need. However,
inspections cannot continue indefinitely in the absence of full Iraqi co-operation. This
must include the provision of all the additional and specific information on the issues
that have been raised in the inspector’s reports.
“Baghdad should have no illusions … The Iraqi regime alone will be responsible for
the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and
does not take this last chance.”
534.  The European Council would “work with Arab countries and The League of Arab
Nations … to bring home to Saddam Hussein the extreme danger of miscalculation”.
It also reiterated “its firm belief in the need to invigorate the peace process in the
Middle East and to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict”.
535.  The European Council concluded:
“The unity of the international community is vital in dealing with these problems.
We are committed to working with all our partners, especially the United States, for
the disarmament of Iraq, for peace and stability in the region and for a decent future
for all its people.”
536.  The UK had argued that the extraordinary meeting of the Council should have
been extended to include Accession Partners and candidates to allow them to contribute
fully to the debate.
537.  After the Council, Mr Blair wrote to the Heads of State and Government of
the Accession Partners and candidates setting out his impressions of the meeting.
The letter concluded:
“… it is essential that we keep the focus on Iraq and its obligation to disarm.
This is a defining moment for the multilateral system. It calls for unity and
unwavering determination on the part of the international community and,
in particular, for solidarity between Europe and the United States …”147
538.  The Partners and candidates subsequently agreed a statement supporting
the outcome of the Council.148

539.  In his monthly press conference the following day, Mr Blair made an opening
statement setting out the “basic case” for the international community’s response
to Iraq.149
540.  The points made by Mr Blair included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

•	

Saddam Hussein was “a threat” whose actions over the last 12 years made
him unique.
The stance taken by the world against Saddam was “not just vital in its own
right”, it was “a huge test of our seriousness in dealing with the twin threats
of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism”.
If the UN was “to keep credibility, it must act to implement its stated will”.
It was “plain in our judgement that Saddam” continued to be “in breach”.
No country at the European Council had disputed that his co-operation
was “neither unconditional nor complete”.
There was “no rush to war”. It was “over three months” since Saddam Hussein
had been given a final opportunity to comply. But without a change of heart, the
inspectors were “never going to be able to play detective to search out weapons
hidden in a country” the size of Iraq.
The basis for action was disarmament.
The demonstrators on 15 February had “a rightful hatred of the consequences
of war”, but they should “also listen to the voices of some of the four million Iraqi
exiles”. The nature of the regime could not itself provide justification for war, it
could “at least show why if we do have to take military action, we do so in the
sure knowledge that we are removing one of the most barbarous and detestable
regimes in modern political history”.
People were against a war which they felt was “rushed or unnecessary” and
wanted to know war was not inevitable. Saddam Hussein could avoid war if he
co-operated fully and that was the “reasonable and easily delivered requirement”
of the international community.

541.  Asked if he reserved the right to go to war without a majority in the UN, Mr Blair
stated that there were “certain situations in which you have simply got to say to people
look this is what I believe and this is what I think is right”. He added that there were
“certain issues, particularly where there are issues of life and death, where I think the job
and duty of the Prime Minister is to say to people what you honestly think, and then they
have got to make up their minds”.
542.  Mr Blair subsequently stated that he did not believe that he would be in a position
where there was no majority in the Security Council, and he did not want to indulge
in speculation on that point.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

543.  Asked about concerns that Washington was rushing unilaterally into action,
Mr Blair responded that people who wanted “to pull Europe and America apart” were
“playing the most dangerous game of international politics” he knew. That was “so
dangerous for the security of the world”. The US had listened to its allies and agreed
to go through the UN to give Saddam Hussein a final chance to disarm. But having done
that, if Saddam did not disarm, Mr Blair asked, “what prospect is there of persuading
America in the future to go down the multilateral route if having taken that route we then
just shy away from the consequences”?
544.  Asked why public opinion was moving against action, Mr Blair replied that in
relation to Kosovo and Afghanistan, there had been “a very immediate casus belli”.
It was “more difficult to persuade people of the link between a state like Iraq with
chemical, or biological, or nuclear weapons and the link with international terrorism”.
It was his job to try to “persuade people of that, and also to persuade people of the
moral case for removing Saddam”.
545.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that “the plan was to consolidate” on the success
at the European Council, and “restate the basic case and get going re Iraq exiles”.
In his meeting of the Iraq communications group on 18 February there was:
“… a clear understanding that we were widening [the communications strategy]
to take in the bigger dimension of the moral and humanitarian side, and we had
to be clear about whether this was shifting to a regime change position. We had
to be clear that it didn’t, that the basic rationale hadn’t changed, but equally we
were entitled to make the case that the world would be better off without him
[Saddam Hussein] in power.”150
546.  Mr Campbell also wrote:
“The US was still giving out the message that it was going to happen and the rest
was just giving us cover, eg saying that a second resolution wasn’t absolutely
necessary but they would try to get it. Maybe they were just getting irritated with
us for having taken them down the UN route in the first place.”

UK proposals for a draft second resolution
547.  On 17 February, Sir David Manning had sent his advice to Mr Blair, of 16 February,
to Mr Straw’s Private Office and to Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary
(PUS), Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Richard Dearlove.151 He wrote that Mr Blair had
asked if they “could look particularly at the tests” suggested for Iraqi compliance.

548.  Sir David asked:

•	
•	
•	

Were these the “right” tests?
Were there others that could added?
“Should the tests be included explicitly in a second resolution, or should this
take the form of a short text simply stating that Saddam Hussein is in breach
of 1441, while the conditions he must meet by 14 March are set out in an
accompanying statement?”

549.  Sir David asked for advice that day, stating that his letter and accompanying
minute should be held “very tightly”, handled “on a strictly need to know basis” and
the addressees should “keep the papers off main files”.
550.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice before the EU Council on 17 February.152
551.  In response to Dr Rice’s report that, in a conversation with Dr Blix over the
weekend, Dr Blix had “felt bad that he had given the Iraqis too much in his …
presentation to the Security Council”, Sir David said that Dr Blix had “overdone the
course correction, worried by the reaction to his earlier presentation on 27 January”.
552.  Sir David told Dr Rice that Dr Blix “had hinted” to Mr Straw “that he might be in
the market for an ultimatum” and they discussed his report which would summarise the
outstanding disarmament questions. They also discussed whether the Security Council
should instruct Dr Blix to destroy the Al Samoud missiles. Sir David commented that he
“strongly favoured” that: “Saddam would hate having to do it and might be provoked into
making a mistake.”
553.  Sir David said the UK was thinking about the shape and timing of an ultimatum:
“We did not have nine votes in the Security Council at present, and were very
unlikely to get there by 28 February … we needed time to shift three or four
abstentions … If it became clear that we could win, we could hope the French
would decide to abstain rather than veto. It was going to be a tough sell …
Once the ultimatum was down, and the deadline was clear, the dynamics would
change … We must take more time if we needed it.”
554.  In the subsequent discussion about how to increase the number of votes in favour
of a resolution and whether, if there was a majority, France would abstain rather than
veto, Dr Rice said that would be a “tough fight” in the US Administration about more
time. She thought 8 March, “exactly four months” after the adoption of resolution 1441,
might be better than 14 March as the French wanted. Sir David commented that he “saw
the attraction”, but: “We must take more time if we need it.”

152

279

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

555.  Sir David and Dr Rice discussed possible avenues to increase the diplomatic
pressure on Saddam Hussein to leave. Dr Rice’s view was that “there were still two
possible outcomes to the crisis: Saddam could step down; or the Security Council would
conclude that he was not complying with 1441 and that action must follow”. They agreed
it would be important to have a clear plan by the end of that week.
556.  Sir David asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock to “sound out” Dr Blix about a possible visit
to London “in the next few days” because Mr Blair “would like to see him, one on one, to
discuss ideas about an ultimatum”. He concluded that the evidence suggested Dr Rice’s:
“… thinking on the way forward is similar to ours. We shall have to think hard about
whether to press for 14 rather than 8 March as the date for a vote … but at least
Condi [Rice] has now moved away from 28 February. This is something the Prime
Minister will want to discuss with Bush when they speak later this week.”
557.  Mr Blair spoke to Dr Blix on 20 February.
558.  Separately, Mr Rycroft produced a list of possible elements for inclusion
in an ultimatum, drawing on the provisions of resolution 1441:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Full explanations of all the material unaccounted for in the last UNSCOM report,
and answers to all of UNSCOM’s questions.
A full list of those involved in the destruction of old chemical weapons stocks,
and full and unfettered access to them in interviews at the location of the
inspectors’ choice and without Iraqi government representatives.
Similarly full co-operation over the interviews of any other witnesses called
by the inspectors, inside or outside Iraq.
Full co-operation over any exclusion zones declared by the inspectors.
Full co-operation over the destruction of the Al Samoud rockets and all other
material identified for destruction by the inspectors.153

559.  Sir Richard Dearlove counselled against specifying the points on which
Saddam Hussein should comply; there was “ample evidence” that he was not,
and had no intention of, complying. There was no guarantee that inspections
would produce conclusive physical evidence.
560.  Sir Richard Dearlove stated that, in his view, the best course would be to stick
with a short text stating that Saddam Hussein was not complying with, and was
therefore in breach of, resolution 1441, backed by the available evidence that that was
the case.154 Listing the points on which we wanted Saddam Hussein to comply would
undermine the overarching argument of resolution 1441 that it was Saddam Hussein,
not the international community, who must do the work of disarmament. The UK should
avoid further moves which perpetuated an inversion of roles. Setting Saddam Hussein

an agenda would allow him to be seen to be making efforts to comply and therefore
to be co-operating with the UN; and that it would be difficult to act on a deadline
if Saddam Hussein was seen still to be co-operating.
561.  Sir Richard also wrote that there was ample evidence, including from Dr Blix, that
Iraq was not, and had no intention of, complying. Given the resources Saddam Hussein
had available to thwart inspections, and the scale of the task of uncovering something
“truly damning”, there was no guarantee that the inspections would produce conclusive
physical evidence.
562.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would have difficulty with any
language which renegotiated resolution 1441 or changed the legal basis for the
use of force; and that there were difficulties in identifying concrete tests which
did not go beyond the resolution.
563.  Sir Jeremy questioned whether the material was available to convince
the majority of the Security Council that the end of the road had been reached.
564.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock discussed the way ahead with Dr Blix and, separately,
Ambassador Negroponte on 17 February, including informal ideas for an ultimatum.155
565.  Sir Jeremy told Dr Blix that the UK remained committed to disarmament by
peaceful means and to a second resolution. But the UK “wanted to force the issue
in the next four weeks”; and that there might be less time if the US “baulked”.
566.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had “noted that it was amazing that, in all their
inspections, UNMOVIC had found no WMD except the (empty) chemical warheads”.
Dr Blix had also commented that nothing had been found in the sites suggested by
the US: “If they had come close there would at least have been a denial of access.”
567.  In response, the UK had “underlined the sophistication of the Iraqi deception
regime – we were confident in our intelligence while some information, e.g. on BW
production, was corroborated by a variety of sources”; and that “given the Iraq deception
mechanism, the key thing was co-operation”.
568.  Sir Jeremy also reported that Ambassador Negroponte “showed interest in an
ultimatum process with concrete tests”, but he foresaw problems with Washington.
The UK should not propose language which renegotiated 1441 or changed the legal
basis for the use of force.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

569.  Reflecting further discussions with the US Mission in New York on 17 February,
Sir Jeremy subsequently reported that:

•	
•	
•	

It was proving difficult to define concrete disarmament tasks with the information
available and which did not go further than the resolutions required.
It would be better if the benchmarks came from Dr Blix. The “key” would be “that
they forced either Iraq to reveal its lie or the Council to come to a conclusion that
Iraq was failing to co-operate”.
The US Mission still favoured a simple “serious consequences” resolution with
a vote by a certain date (or abandon the exercise altogether) if Iraq had not
radically changed its approach.156

570.  Sir Jeremy advised that he remained of the view that we should put forward a
resolution sooner rather than later to move the debate on. That could include a list of
benchmarks discussed with Dr Blix, but he could also see the attractions of tabling
a resolution now which simply called for disarmament, leaving Dr Blix or the middleground members of the Council to seek to define concrete actions. That would tie the US
into the process. Delay risked appearing to be on the back foot, “uncertainty about our/
the Council’s intentions, perhaps reducing the likelihood that Iraq will realise the game
is up and surrender its WMD (or ditch Saddam)”.
571.  The telegram also made clear that Sir Jeremy had commented to Ambassador
Negroponte that “perhaps we just did not possess the material to convince others that
we were right to claim it was the end of the road”.
572.  The UK Mission in New York offered suggested elements for a resolution
which reflected discussions with Dr Blix.
573.  The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York provided a paper overnight on
17/18 February setting out possible elements for a new ultimatum strategy.157 It pointed
out that resolution 1441 had used words like “active” and “unconditional” without defining
them, and referred to a “final opportunity” for “immediate” co-operation without specifying
how long that should take.
574.  Addressing whether co-operation had been immediate, the UK Mission stated:

•	
•	

“On the whole there has been great promptness of response”, and co-operation
on process had been “without delays or foot dragging”.
Co-operation on substance could “hardly be said” to have been “active”,
although “a few recent measures” could be, “provided their potential usefulness
is borne out by real results”.

Iraq had appointed two Commissions, one to look for any remaining proscribed
items and one to look for any relevant documentation. A third Iraqi initiative had
been the provision of a list of personnel who had taken part in the destruction
of proscribed chemical items in 1991.
The Iraqi papers presented at the meeting in Baghdad on 8 to 9 February were
spontaneous and “focused on central issues, but without any new evidence”.
Iraq claimed it was encouraging “persons to come for ‘private’ interviews
In Baghdad”, but there was doubt that they “really feel they can talk freely”.
Interviews outside Iraq were “certainly an option”, but raised “difficult issues”.

575.  The UK Mission asked:
“If it seems clear that many governments feel that enough time has not yet
been given for the option of disarmament through inspection, how much
further time, would they ask for inspections … before they give up on this option
and how ‘active’ should Iraq be required to be?
“It does not seem unreasonable to hold that 11 weeks of inspections, which have
barely come up to full strength, and which come after a period of eight years of
inspections between 1991 and 1998 and four years of non-inspections between the
end of 1998 and November 2002, is a rather short period to allow a final conclusion
that the disarmament requirements cannot be fulfilled through this method. What is
clear … is that military and political pressure has been and remains indispensable
to bring about compliance. A slackening of it would, in all likelihood, result in
less co‑operation.”
576.  The UK Mission proposed that, in the circumstances, an “explicit time line within
which satisfactory co-operation and the required resolution of unresolved disarmament
issues (or ‘key remaining disarmament tasks’) would be demanded”, would “not seem
unreasonable”. Addressing how long would be needed, it stated:
“Under resolution 1284 (1999) 120 days were thought to be a time frame within
which ‘progress’ on key remaining disarmament tasks would be. It is evidently
a question of political judgement how much time should now be given under
resolution 1441 (2002). However, a time frame should not be set without any regard
to what may be achievable …”
577.  Addressing who would judge “whether there has been co-operation and
disarmament”, the UK Mission stated:
“In the last resort the Security Council must provide the answer, but it seems likely
that the Council would need to rely on a prior assessment by UNMOVIC and
the IAEA.”
578.  Both questions were “very broad” and judgements would be easier if there were
“some particular actions” or “benchmarks” which could be identified as “indispensable

283

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

but not conclusive”. Similarly, the extent of disarmament “could perhaps be judged
on the basis of progress noted on some key issues (as was specified in resolution
1284 (1999)) rather than the whole catalogue of issues”. Although some of the measures
required might not be possible, because of lack of documents or witnesses, “it would
probably be possible to see whether Iraq provided active, genuine co-operation to solve
the issues rather than dragging its feet and be evasive”.
579.  The UK Mission provided an illustrative text for a draft resolution, including a
request that UMOVIC and the IAEA submit a list of unresolved disarmament issues and
questions “by [1 March] … indicating which, in their view are key points, and what …
Iraq should do to solve these issues and to answer these questions”. The draft left open
the date by which UNMOVIC and the IAEA would be asked to submit a report with their
judgement on whether the issues and questions had been resolved and Iraq had fulfilled
its obligations.

Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, 19 February 2003
580.  Mr Straw and Mr Blair discussed the way ahead before a telephone call with
President Bush. As result, the FCO produced an illustrative list of benchmarks
which Dr Blix could be encouraged to propose alongside a “simple draft
resolution” declaring Saddam Hussein to be in breach of resolution 1441.
581.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice on 18 February that the European Council had
“gone well” and that the “emphasis had been on the need for Saddam’s swift and
full compliance” with resolution 1441: “Recourse to force, once other options were
exhausted had been conceded albeit reluctantly in the usual quarters.”158
582.  Sir David and Dr Rice discussed the next steps, including the nature of a second
resolution declaring simply that Saddam was in violation of resolution 1441; the
possibility of a vote after Dr Blix’s next report to the Security Council and the advantages
and risks of setting rigorous benchmarks requiring total compliance to judge Saddam’s
performance.
583.  Sir David told Dr Rice that Mr Blair’s preference was for a vote on 14 March. That:
“… had the advantage of playing to the date proposed by the French. But it also
gave us a precious extra few days to secure nine votes. In the end this was what it
was about. We had to fashion our ultimatum and choose our timing to give ourselves
the very best chance of getting the necessary majority … this was critically important
for us politically.”
584.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the UK needed a second resolution, and
that “everything now had to be subordinate to that”.159 He suggested setting Iraq

“benchmarks” for co-operation by “filleting” Dr Blix’s paper. If the benchmarks were
set high and Saddam Hussein co-operated, the US and UK would have “won by a
different route”. Although Secretary Powell had reservations about including benchmarks
in a second resolution, they agreed that Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Ambassador
Negroponte should discuss a list with Dr Blix.
585.  In response to a request for advice in preparation for Mr Blair’s discussion with
President Bush, Sir David Manning wrote that:

•	
•	

•	

Mr Blair should seek to secure President Bush’s agreement to delay a vote
in the Security Council until 14/15 March to provide “a few, precious extra
days … [which] might make the difference to securing the critical nine votes”.
The second resolution should be “very simple, declaring Saddam in violation/
breach of [resolution] 1441 – without specifying what happens or when”. That
should be accompanied by tough tests “agreed with Blix if possible” which
Saddam Hussein would have to pass “in full”. Sir David wrote that Saddam
Hussein “almost certainly won’t comply. If he does, we’ve won anyway”; the
tests should “stick to what is stipulated in resolution 1441 and to the general
disarmament categories, otherwise Saddam will play games”; and that the UK
would be looking for “yes/no answers” from Dr Blix.
There would also be a much better chance of gaining support for the resolution
if it was clear that the UN would have a “key role” after any military action
and that a “massive humanitarian aid programme” would be instituted; and
by publishing and implementing the Road Map on Israel/Palestine before
any military action. Sir David advised that both points would be a “tough sell”
with President Bush, but “both are very important in helping us to win the
argument”.160

586.  Following a discussion between Mr Blair and Mr Straw, Mr Ricketts sent
Sir David Manning an illustrative list of benchmarks, which Dr Blix could be encouraged
“to propose alongside a simple draft resolution”.161 Mr Straw recommended allowing a
few days before tabling the draft resolution early the following week.
587.  Mr Ricketts wrote that Dr Blix had “spoken about selecting benchmarks from
the list of unresolved disarmament issues which UNMOVIC has drawn up (the cluster
document)”; and that it would “not be easy to circulate the cluster document before
1 March”.
588.  Mr Ricketts suggested the UK could propose its own benchmarks as a way
to get Dr Blix to focus quickly. The illustrative list covered biological weapons,
chemical weapons, ballistic missiles, documentation and unrestricted interviews
with key personnel.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

589.  In his memoir, Dr Blix recorded that he had finalised his ideas about how
UNMOVIC’s work on clusters might be used on 17 February, producing both a draft
resolution and a background paper which he gave to Sir Jeremy Greenstock.162
Sir Jeremy gave the documents to the Americans.
590.  Explaining his thinking that inspections offered Iraq “an opportunity that was not
open endlessly” and that it was “for the Council – but not individual members of it –
to consider and decide on the alternative to inspections”, Dr Blix wrote that military
pressure “was and remained indispensable to bringing about Iraqi compliance” but:
“… many delegations felt that not enough time had yet been given to inspections;
eleven weeks was rather a short time to allow the final conclusion that disarmament
could not be achieved through the inspection path and would have to be abandoned.
It would not seem unreasonable … to set ‘an explicit time line’ within which
satisfactory co-operation and resolution of unresolved disarmament issues and key
remaining disarmament tasks would be demanded. It was a political judgement …
to decide how much time would be given.
“It would be for the Security Council to judge – after a report by the inspectors –
whether there had been adequate co-operation and resulting disarmament …
“My draft requested that UNMOVIC/IAEA submit by 1 March a list of ‘key points’
… along with indications of what Iraq should do to resolve them (the benchmarks).
It further spelled out a number of demands for Iraqi actions … It requested
UNMOVIC/IAEA to report to the Council before a specific date … whether Iraq had
done what was asked of it. Lastly, it stipulated that if the Security Council were to
conclude that Iraq had not fulfilled what was demanded and thus had ‘not made
use of the inspection process,’ the inspections would be terminated and the
Council would ‘consider other measures to solve the disarmament issue’.”
591.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that there was no agreed position within the
US Administration about how to work on a second resolution and UK views were
best registered directly with President Bush.
592.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that the US Administration was still debating the
timing and contents of a second resolution and that there was no agreed interagency
position on how best to work with Dr Blix on a second resolution.163
593.  There was concern about Dr Blix’s reluctance to press Iraq on mobile biological
weapons facilities, because the “knowledge” of those facilities came from intelligence,
which “appeared to put the onus on the US/UK to prove these existed rather than on
Iraq to reassure the Council that they did not”; and that he might have lost sight of the
fact that Iraq’s co-operation on process was not synonymous with disarmament.

594.  The US Principals were minded to see benchmarks as a record of what Iraq had
not done, rather than a headline list of what Saddam Hussein should do.
595.  Sir Christopher also advised that the UK’s views were “best registered directly
by the Prime Minister” with President Bush.
596.  Mr Blair sent President Bush a six-page Note on 19 February.
597.  Mr Blair proposed focusing on the absence of full co-operation and
a “simple” resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity,
with a side statement defining tough tests of co-operation and a vote
on 14 March to provide a deadline for action.
598.  Mr Hoon was not consulted about the approach to be adopted.
599.  Mr Blair sent President Bush a six-page Note on 19 February.164
600.  Mr Blair stated that it was “a defining moment in EU/US relations and in
the future direction of Europe”. He wrote that it was “apparent to me from the EU
summit that France wants to make this a crucial test: is Europe America’s partner
or competitor? … For the first time … a strong bloc prepared to challenge France
and Germany” was emerging.
601.  Mr Blair wrote that “European public opinion seemed to favour France” and
that was being used “to embarrass the pro-US case, to inhibit the pro-US leaders”.
Those leaders had been:
“… remarkably firm in the face of really difficult polls and demonstrations.
“But the issue will be this: is it the US that is forced to go it alone with the UK,
or is it France that is left isolated with a choice as to whether to use its veto?
“That is in turn a function of where public opinion is outside … the US.”
602.  Mr Blair added that was “far more nuanced than people think”. In his view, public
opinion outside the US was:
“… not against conflict in all circumstances. What they fear is that we are hell bent
on war, come what may, that we don’t really want the UN to succeed.”
603.  Mr Blair wrote that fear was “absurd”:
“The issue of time for the inspections has become vicariously, the focus for
this sentiment. At the heart of this is a confusion between active and passive
co-operation. The duty on Saddam is to co-operate fully; ie actively to help the
Inspectors. If he isn’t he’s in breach. But the France/Germany view – too much
shared by others on the Security Council – is that the inspectors should have
164 

Letter Manning to Rice, 19 February 2003, ‘Iraq’ attaching Note [Blair to Bush], [undated], ‘Note’.

287

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

the time they need to “sniff out” the weapons … and all Saddam needs to do is to
offer passive co-operation, ie the absence of obstruction. Obviously if this is right,
they could be there for months or years.”
604.  Mr Blair added:
“Our view, which is correct is that time is irrelevant unless he [Saddam] is
co‑operating fully and actively. If he isn’t, the time needed is just the time necessary
to make a judgement as to his co-operation: is it full or not? And actually, no one …
is seriously suggesting Saddam is co-operating fully.”
605.  Mr Blair wrote that Dr Blix “unfortunately” embodied that confusion. His report
to the Security Council on 14 February “never suggested there was full co-operation;
indeed the opposite”. But the tone “seemed to imply that because Saddam was
co‑operating more on process, that was an improvement despite the fact that there
was no co-operation on substance”.
606.  Mr Blair reported that recent conversations with Dr Blix showed that he was “aware
of this problem, and is prepared to countenance a definitive judgement and was shocked
at how negatively for the US/UK his report was spun”. Mr Blair added: “My faith in Blix
is somewhat shaken. But he remains key.”
607.  Mr Blair suggested:
“… the trick we need to take is this: we have to find a way of re-focusing the issue
on the absence of full co-operation … and do so in a way that pulls public opinion
and the UNSC waverers back to us by showing that we have indeed made every
effort to avoid war.”
608.  Mr Blair proposed that the US and UK should:

•	
•	
•	

Put down a new resolution “soon, probably early next week”. That resolution
would be “simple and clear and as easy to vote for as we can make it”.
Put the resolution “to a vote on 14 March, the date France has suggested
for a [Security Council] meeting of Foreign Ministers”. That would then become
“the deadline for action”.
“At the same time” the resolution was tabled, there would be a side statement
defining the categories of full co-operation: “full disclosure of the 1998 leftovers;
witnesses interviewed outside Iraq; destruction of the rocket motors etc”. That
should be “sufficient if he did it, to amount to a complete and total capitulation
by Saddam”. That was “the ultimatum”.

609.  Mr Blair wrote that he would be speaking to Dr Blix the following day to try to “tie”
him in “to accept this is indeed what must happen”.

288

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

610.  Mr Blair continued that the UK and US should say that:
“… failure in any respect to meet this test, will amount to non-co-operation; that
this is a final attempt by us to disarm Saddam peacefully; that by 14 March it will
be 4 months since 1441, quite long enough to assess whether he is co-operating
or not.
“We work like crazy next week to get the UNSC members to agree or at least not
oppose this strategy; and then build the support to carry a majority for 14 March.”
611.  Mr Blair recognised that there were both advantages and disadvantages in his
proposed approach. The disadvantages were identified as:

•	
•	
•	

The risk that Saddam Hussein “might conceivably comply fully – but the chances
of this, according to all the intelligence are minimal”. If he did comply, “it would
still amount to a huge humiliation [to Saddam Hussein]”.
Saddam Hussein might “seem” to comply but that was “a risk in any event and
by defining non-compliance so clearly” the “chances of ambiguity” would be
minimised.
The start of military action might be delayed by a week: “But this is not long and
the blunt truth is that by next Friday i.e. 28 February or even a week later … the
chances of securing nine votes are very slim. A week’s wait is worth a resolution;
or at least a majority on the UNSC.”

612.  Mr Blair saw the advantages as:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

putting the US and UK “back in the driving seat, with a clear deadline and
ultimatum”;
re-focusing the “debate where it should be” on Iraq’s duty “fully to co-operate”;
giving the “doubters a reason to sign up”;
helping “the Arab world come on board”;
accepting the French date;
allowing the US and UK to “show the world we are going to war, not because
we want to, but because we have to”; and
“Above all”:
{{ show
{{ set

“the US reaching out”;

“the UN a fundamental test”;

{{ give

the Europeans something to rally round; and

{{ “When

we do act, it will show we went the last mile for peace.”

613.  Mr Blair told President Bush:
“A successful second resolution would be an enormous success for your diplomacy
over the last few months.

289

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“I have never come across an issue in which the dividing line between overwhelming
support and overwhelming opposition is so slender.”
614.  Mr Blair added that, in the UK, which was “reasonably typical of European opinion”,
“large majorities” believed:

•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein was “a threat and needs disarming”;
“without the threat of action, he wouldn’t disarm”; and
“in military action if there is a new UN resolution or even without a resolution if
we had a majority of the UNSC … ie France would veto and we could still do it.”

615.  Mr Blair wrote: “Around 80 percent” in the UK supported an ultimatum and
acknowledged that inspections could only work if Saddam co-operated. Yet a majority
opposed action at that time. The “only explanation” was that:
“… they needed to be persuaded that the US and UK would prefer peaceful
disarmament if that were possible. Proving it isn’t possible is the huge benefit
of the ultimatum route.”
616.  Finally, Mr Blair offered “two further thoughts”:

•	
•	

“Publishing the MEPP Road Map would have a massive impact in Europe
and the Arab world.”
There was a “need to start firming up the humanitarian work for the aftermath
of the conflict … and show how we will protect and improve the lives of
Iraqi people.”

617.  Mr Campbell wrote that the Note had set out the basic strategy: “that we put down
a UNSCR, not to push to a vote, instead use it like an ultimatum, give him two weeks
or so to take us to the French date of 14 March.”165
618.  In their discussion at lunchtime on 19 February, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell
discussed the fact that Dr Blix was “not yet ready to say that Iraq was not co-operating
on substance” and the difficulties of agreeing a list of tests with him that “set the bar
satisfactorily high”.166
619.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice before the phone call between Mr Blair and
President Bush on 19 February to explain the UK’s thinking. He reported that he had
“emphasised yet again that … It was critical to give ourselves enough time to secure
nine votes.”167

620.  Sir David had also addressed in some detail the importance of a US commitment
to the Road Map, for the MEPP.
621.  Mr Straw spoke twice to Secretary Powell on the evening of 19 February.168
622.  Mr Straw continued to press for the draft resolution to be tabled after the weekend,
not before, and for a vote to take place on 14 March. He and Secretary Powell also
discussed the text of the resolution, benchmarks and a possible ultimatum to Saddam
Hussein telling him to leave. Mr Straw commended Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s language
in the draft resolution, stating that the Council “decides the final opportunity has not been
taken” and talking more about Saddam Hussein’s obligation for “voluntary disarmament”.
623.  In the context of conversations with Palestinian and Israeli representatives,
Mr Straw repeated the imperative for publication of the Road Map to secure Arab
support for action on Iraq.
624.  President Bush and Mr Blair agreed to introduce a draft resolution at the
UN the following week but its terms were subject to further discussion.
625.  Mr Blair telephoned President Bush later on 19 February.169 They discussed the
positions of France, Germany and Russia and key regional countries. Mr Blair said it
was “a defining moment”.
626.  Mr Blair repeated the arguments that the resolution and ultimatum route would help
to demonstrate that the US and UK did not want war but were prepared to use force if
that was the only way to disarm Saddam Hussein. Addressing the question of whether
disarmament should be defined for Dr Blix and if identifying tasks for Saddam Hussein
would allow Saddam Hussein to do some and try to show he was co-operating, Mr Blair
said that, when the resolution was tabled, “we should set out the issues that were part
of full co-operation”.
627.  Mr Blair and President Bush agreed the resolution would be introduced at the
UN the following week.
628.  Mr Blair also set out the reasons for a vote around 14 March. It would be important
for No.10 and the White House to remain in close contact on communications. Mr Blair
said that the resolution and ultimatum route would “help us to demonstrate that we did
not want war but were prepared to use force if that was the only way to disarm Saddam”.
629.  Finally, Mr Blair underlined the importance of progress on the MEPP to help
transform opinion in Europe and the Arab world.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

630.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair told President Bush that we couldn’t dispute public
opinion was against us but he strongly felt that the French and Germans were in the
right place for public opinion but in the wrong place for the world.170
631.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that, in his Note of 19 February, Mr Blair had
“urged that we forge ahead” and that he had written: “The stakes are now much higher”.
Mr Blair had also written that it was “apparent” to him “from the EU Summit that France
wants to make this a crucial test: Is Europe America’s partner or competitor?”, and that
there was support for the US from a strong European coalition.171

At the request of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat, the JIC produced
an Assessment on 19 February of the situation in southern Iraq and what might happen
there before, during and after any coalition military action.172
The Assessment and Mr Blair’s request for further advice are addressed in Sections 6.2
and 6.5.

Security Council open debate, 18 and 19 February 2003
632.  An open debate of the Security Council requested by the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) was held on 18 and 19 February.173 The debate gave the Security Council the
opportunity to hear the views of non-members.
633.  Sixty UN Member States or Permanent Observers spoke in the debate, the
overwhelming majority opposing the use of force. The members of the Security Council
did not speak. Ms Louise Fréchette, UN Deputy Secretary-General, attended the debate,
but did not speak.
634.  Mr Dumisani Kumalo, South African Permanent Representative to the UN,
speaking on behalf of the NAM, said that NAM members considered resolution 1441
to be “about ensuring that Iraq is peacefully disarmed”. The Security Council was yet
to “fully utilize the inspection mechanisms of resolution 1441”.
635.  Mr Aldouri stated that the United States had transformed a “technical and
scientific issue” into a “political” one, and reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to “full
and active co-operation with UNMOVIC and the IAEA”.

636.  Mr Paul Heinbecker, Canadian Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that,
since the withdrawal of inspectors in 1998, there had been “no proof” that Iraq had rid
itself of WMD. There were reasons to believe the opposite was the case. Recent Iraqi
co-operation had only come in response to intense international pressure. More time
for inspectors could be useful, but only if Iraq decided to co-operate “fully, actively and
transparently, beginning now”.
637.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the debate had been a “necessary exercise”
which had been organised by Germany (as President of the Council).174 “Almost all”
Member States who had spoken “expressed a preference for a peaceful outcome,
but almost all stressed the need for better Iraqi compliance”.

Deployment of South African scientists to Baghdad
When Mr Blair met Mr Thabo Mbeki, the South African President, at Chequers
on 1 February, they had three hours of private talks.175
On Iraq, the readout from the discussions was that Mr Blair had “debriefed” Mr Mbeki
on his talks with Washington and set out the UK position “in normal terms”. Mr Mbeki told
Mr Blair that Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, “had asked South Africa to
send a team to Iraq to advise on how disarmament should be done”. Mr Blair “commented
that there was not much doubt about what Iraq should do”.
Mr Aziz Pahad, the South African Deputy Foreign Minister, told the British High
Commission that, following his visit to Baghdad from 9 to 13 February, where he had had
meetings with Saddam Hussein, Mr Tariq Aziz and others, South Africa would be sending
a team of apartheid-era scientists to advise Iraq on disarmament.176
Mr Pahad said that he had delivered the message that Iraq must comply fully with
resolution 1441, and the time for compliance was running out. Subsequently he added
that he had urged full rather than partial co-operation; this was “an all or nothing” decision.
Mr Pahad’s assessment was reported to be that:

•	
•	

Iraqi attitudes were slowly shifting;

•	
•	

those in favour of co-operation might be “winning out”; and

the inspectors to whom he had spoken had noticed and reported this mood
change;
the resolution of the U2 over flights issue was “major progress”.

Mr Pahad said South Africa’s objective was to prevent war by ensuring the success of
weapons inspections. A team of experts would be sent to Iraq “imminently”. They would
not have direct contact with the UN inspectors, “but would be proactive in helping Iraq
to co-operate and demonstrate this co-operation”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Mr Pahad added that the initiative gave Iraq “the possibility of a face-saving climb-down …
if Saddam seriously rushed to comply”.
The British High Commission commented that Mr Pahad was “cautiously optimistic that
South Africa might be able to help resolve the current stand-off in Iraq”, but was “realistic
about the obstacles” that remained.

Mr Blair’s conversation with Dr Blix, 20 February 2003
638.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Dr Blix that the Security Council had to realise
that if it was not willing to authorise force if Iraq did not disarm, the issue would
be taken out of its hands.
639.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Dr Blix on 19 February that the UK was likely to go
for an approach “signalling the end game on Iraq”.177 The UK “would say that the Council
had to realise that this would be out of the hands of the UN unless it decided that Iraq
had to start the process of real disarmament and was willing to authorise force if it did
not”. The UK “still hoped to avert the use of force – but we had to be realistic”.
640.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was not averse to a deadline but 15 March was
“not theoretically doable”. He concluded that the “Blix benchmark possibilities” had been
“tested” and “set aside as too risky”.
641.  Sir Jeremy also reported that Dr Blix had said he would issue a decision on
missiles to Iraq within 24 hours; and that UNMOVIC had “just received an ‘amazingly’
detailed document on the persons involved in the destruction of biological weapons
which could be significant”. The meeting of the College of Commissioners for UNMOVIC
on 24 and 25 February would discuss the “clusters” document. Dr Blix expected it to be
finalised by 3 March, but he did not intend to submit it to the Security Council; it “was
an exercise to help UNMOVIC define the key remaining disarmament tasks due under
1284 – but would do so if asked”.
642.  Sir Jeremy commented that the UK was “likely to say that, if Iraq did not rapidly
demonstrate it was engaging in voluntary disarmament, this document was academic”.
643.  Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he wanted to offer the US an alternative strategy
which included a deadline and tests for compliance. He did not think Saddam
would co-operate but he would try to get Dr Blix as much time as possible.
644.  Dr Blix stated that full co-operation was a nebulous concept; and a deadline
of 15 April would be too early.
645.  Mr Blair telephoned Dr Blix on 20 February.178 They spoke for 45 minutes.

646.  The record of the discussion stated that Mr Blair referred to US disappointment
with Dr Blix’s report of 14 February and that it was “now difficult to dissuade the
Americans from going down the military route”. Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he was
concerned about the risk of the UN being marginalised and of a split in the international
community; and that he wanted to offer the US “an alternative strategy”.
647.  Mr Blair outlined the need to devise an ultimatum including a deadline and
imposing a duty on Saddam Hussein to co-operate actively; and that failure to do
so would be a breach of resolution 1441. That would accompany a “simple” resolution
that would be Saddam Hussein’s “final final” warning. There were “some indications”
that, with a second resolution, “the Arabs might be able to lever Saddam out of power”.
Mr Blair added that co-operation would need to be defined and Saddam Hussein would
need to comply in full.
648.  Dr Blix was attracted by timelines but commented that “full co-operation was
a nebulous concept”. Later he stated that demands for co-operation had to be related
to what was “realistically do-able”.
649.  Dr Blix told Mr Blair that the UN should have a catalogue of the action required on
disarmament by the end of the following week. He should be able to share the “clusters”
of unanswered questions with the UNMOVIC College of Commissioners by 24 February.
The intelligence he had received was “not all that compelling”. While he still tended to
think that Iraq was concealing some WMD, he needed evidence to put to the Security
Council. He was receiving “a flow of half promises” on Iraqi co-operation and needed
more time.
650.  Mr Blair said that the Iraqis could have signalled a change of heart in the
December declaration. The Americans did not think that Saddam Hussein was going
to co-operate: “Nor did he. But we needed to keep the international community together.”
651.  Dr Blix suggested that “key disarmament tasks” could be selected from resolution
1284 as it would be easier to judge compliance on those. They discussed the difficulties
with interviewing Iraqis, which Dr Blix said he would be working on the following week.
It was important to keep the pressure on Iraq.
652.  Dr Blix confirmed that he had suggested a deadline of 15 April to the US, which
they thought was too late. He thought it was too early. The threat of war was making
it difficult to recruit and retain inspectors.
653.  Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he would pursue the ultimatum route and try to get
Dr Blix as much time as possible.
654.  Dr Blix commented that “perhaps there was not much WMD in Iraq after all”.
Mr Blair responded that “even German and French intelligence were sure that there was
WMD in Iraq”. Dr Blix said they seemed “unsure” about mobile BW production facilities:

295

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“It would be paradoxical and absurd if 250,000 men were to invade Iraq and find
very little.”
655.  Mr Blair responded: “our intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted
his WMD programme”.
656.  The record stated that Dr Blix had “concluded that he accepted the need
for timelines and benchmarks”.
657.  In his account of the conversation, Dr Blix wrote that he had said:
“Only at three sites to which we had gone on the basis of intelligence had there been
any result at all.
“Personally I tended to think that Iraq still concealed weapons of mass destruction,
but I needed evidence. Perhaps there were not many such weapons in Iraq
after all.”179
658.  After the conversation between Mr Blair and Dr Blix, Sir David Manning told
Dr Rice that while Dr Blix had understood the key point that Iraq was not co-operating
fully with the UN, it was “equally clear that he was not ready to say so to the Security
Council”.180 The need was therefore to keep him focused on this question of co‑operation
and “persuade him that the logic of the situation was that we should now issue an
ultimatum”. Dr Blix would need to decide whether “he was going to be a party to the
pretence that Iraq was co-operating with the UN system when, in fact, Saddam’s
defiance risked wrecking it”.
659.  Sir David also recorded US/UK agreement to table a second resolution
on 24 February and the UK’s preference for the “very light” resolution proposed
by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. There would be a need to prepare the launch carefully
with members of the E10 and potential allies in the Security Council.
660.  Asked about his response to Dr Blix’s comment about the implications of invading
Iraq and finding “very little”, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he had told Dr Blix: “What you
have to tell us is … whether he is complying with the resolution. Is he giving immediate
compliance and full compliance or not?” Dr Blix’s answer was: “No, but, you never know,
it may be that, if we are given more time, he will.”181
661.  Mr Blair added that the conversation had led to him working with Dr Blix “to try and
get a fresh … resolution. I kept working on that right up until the last moment.”

662.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary advised Sir David Manning on
20 February that the “chances of a successful inspection are increasingly slim”.182
SIS had sent messages to its best placed sources “emphasising the utmost importance
of a major find in the next two weeks, and asking them to do everything possible to
try and identify where materials or papers being hidden”. The chances of a potential
defector were “not encouraging”.
663.  An internal FCO minute of the Iraq morning meeting on 20 February recorded that
the UK was “now moving away from the idea of benchmarks from Dr Blix, given US
concerns … and the difficulty of coming up with anything specific enough”.183
664.  The FCO instructions for Dr Bryan Wells, MOD Director Counter-Proliferation and
Arms Control and UK representative on the UNMOVIC College of Commissioners, for
the discussion of the “clusters document”, stated that it was important that he did:
“… nothing which suggests the UK endorses the document, or even accepts
the validity of proceeding with work against the SCR 1284 timetable in present
circumstances. That is not to say that we regard … 1284 as invalid. But it must now
be viewed in the light of SCR 1441, which requires Iraq to co-operate ‘immediately,
unconditionally and actively’ with the inspectors. We see no point in proceeding with
work mandated by … 1284 so long as such co-operation is lacking.”184
665.  The FCO added: “We realise that this will not be an easy line to take. It may in the
event be best simply to say that the paper appears irrelevant in present circumstances
of Iraqi non-co-operation, and then decline to engage on the substance.”
666.  The FCO also wrote that it realised the position might “annoy” Dr Blix, and UKMIS
New York was asked to forewarn him of the UK’s likely approach, and to:
“… explain our concern that the … document may be exploited by some countries
as an excuse to postpone a further decision on the fundamental issue of Iraqi
co‑operation … thereby undermining the pressure on Baghdad.”
667.  The letter showed that the initial view of officials had been that the document
“could be played into the long grass” as “no more than an internal piece of UNMOVIC
work-in-progress”; and that “As such there should be no question of it being presented
to the Security Council.” But there were suggestions that others might present it “as a
set of benchmarks” which could be used to “focus the Council’s attention on the middle
distance – well past the mid-March date we and the US are looking at for a decision”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Agreement on the text of a second resolution
668.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell reached agreement on the text of the draft
resolution on 20 February.
669.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock gave Ambassador Negroponte a revised “light draft
resolution” on 19 February which:

•	
•	

noted (draft preambular paragraph 5) that Iraq had “submitted a declaration …
containing false statements and omissions and has failed to comply with and
co‑operate fully in the implementation of that resolution [1441]”; and
decided (draft OP1) that Iraq had “failed to take the final opportunity afforded
to it in resolution 1441 (2002)”.185

670.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte that the draft “was
thin on anything with which Council members could argue and would be less frightening
to the middle ground”. It did not refer to “serious consequences” and that “instead of
relying on OP4 of 1441”, the draft resolution “relied on OP1 of 1441, re-establishing the
material breach suspended in OP2”.186
671.  Sir Jeremy added that issuing the draft would signal the intent to move to a final
debate, which they should seek to focus “not on individual elements of co-operation but
on the failure by Iraq to voluntarily disarm” and being “thrown off course by individual
benchmarks or judgement by Blix”. It should be accompanied by a “powerful statement
about what 1441 had asked for” which had “been twisted into partial, procedural,
and grudging co-operation from Iraq”; and that “substantive, active and voluntary
co‑operation was not happening”.
672.  In response to a question from the US about whether the “central premise”,
that the final opportunity was “now over”, would be disputed, Sir Jeremy said that:
“was where we would have to define our terms carefully: voluntary disarmament
was not happening.”
673.  The US and UK agreed they should co-sponsor the resolution with Spain and that
the UK would “lead in explaining it to the Council”.
674.  Lord Goldsmith’s response to Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s rationale for the second
resolution is addressed in Section 5.
675.  Mr Straw had two conversations with Secretary Powell on 20 February. In the
first, they discussed UK and US drafts for a second resolution. Mr Straw said that he
had “no firm view about which one was best”.187 Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s view was
that the lighter the language the more likely the UK was to attract the support needed

from “swing countries”. Mr Blair wanted a report to the Council on 7 March but there
were indications that Dr Blix might want longer. If a majority in the Security Council
supported more time, Mr Blair would be in “a very difficult position”. Mr Straw told
Secretary Powell that an agreed strategy was needed, including tabling a side document
with the resolution “containing our list of demands”.
676.  Concluding the conversation, Mr Straw stated that if “extraordinarily Iraq complied,
the UK could not go to war”. Secretary Powell was reported to have replied that “in
the end, there was only one difference between us: President Bush had already made
his decision”. If Mr Blair’s “efforts did not permit the UK to be there, Bush would still
go alone”.
677.  Following the first conversation with Secretary Powell, Mr Ricketts advised
Mr Straw that the US draft would be “much more difficult for middle ground opinion”
to accept.188 Mr Ricketts wrote that it was the UK, not the Americans, which needed
the resolution; and that the Greenstock text delivered what the UK needed and would
be more difficult to oppose. It was “more compatible with building a case in the
Security Council that the issue is a simple one of whether or not Iraq is in compliance”.
678.  Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw to go back to Secretary Powell to press the UK view.
679.  Mr Ricketts suggested that the UK might also “move away from the concept of
tabling lists of benchmarks”. He wrote that the work with the US delegation in New York
had “shown up how difficult it is to isolate questions which are susceptible [to] yes/no
answers in the time-frame we need”; and that there was a risk that it would “play into
the hands of the ‘more time’ merchants”. Mr Ricketts suggested that it might be better to
draw on the work that had been done to “set out in a co-ordinated way some illustrative
tests such as the destruction of rocket motors or producing specified people for interview
in acceptable conditions”.
680.  Mr Ricketts concluded that would be “more compatible with the approach in the
Jeremy Greenstock draft resolution of making our case on the basis of whether Iraq was
in full co-operation or not”.
681.  In his second conversation with Secretary Powell on 20 February, Mr Straw stated
that the UK Government “was signed up to the Greenstock language. If countries voted
for that … they would … be voting to let us go to war.”189
682.  In response to questioning from Secretary Powell about whether he was sure that
was the right call, Mr Straw said that “we were sure that the Greenstock language would
do the trick”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

683.  The British Embassy Washington reported overnight that, subject to a final word
from President Bush, the US was prepared to “go with” the UK draft and was gearing
up for a major lobbying exercise.190
684.  Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Aznar about tabling
the resolution in a conference call on 22 February.191
685.  In a conversation with Prime Minister Aznar, Mr Blair agreed that the resolution
should be tabled late on Monday 24 February, after the meeting of the General Affairs
and External Relations Council of the EU.192

Presentation of the UK’s strategy
686.  In response to the level of concern in the UK, Mr Blair asked for a
communications strategy based on the theme of a “last push for peace”.
687.  Mr Campbell wrote that, on the morning of 20 February, Mr Blair “was getting more
and more worried about Iraq, and with good reason”. He had asked for a strategy on the
theme of “the last push for peace”, with a strong media plan to underpin it. Mr Campbell
had emphasised the need for a sense that “we were trying to avoid war, not rush
towards it.193
688.  Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Cormac Murphy
O’Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, issued a joint statement on 20 February about
“the crisis involving Iraq”.194 Recognising the “huge burden of responsibility carried by
those who must make the ultimate decision”, the statement said:
“The events of recent days show that doubts still persist about the moral legitimacy
as well as the unpredictable humanitarian consequences of a war with Iraq.
“We recognise that the moral alternative to military action cannot be inaction …
It is vital therefore that all sides … engage through the United Nations fully and
urgently in a process, including continued weapons inspections, that could and
should render the trauma and tragedy of war unnecessary.
“We strongly urge the Government of Iraq to demonstrate forthwith its unequivocal
compliance with UN resolutions on weapons of mass destruction.
“… We must hope and pray … an outcome that brings peace with justice to Iraq
and the Middle East may yet be found.”

689.  In a speech on reintegrating Iraq into the international community at Chatham
House on 21 February, Mr Straw focused on the threat which Saddam Hussein posed
to the people of Iraq and the moral case for action.195
690.  Mr Straw stated that there was international unity about the objective of disarming
Saddam Hussein who posed “a unique threat to international peace and security”.
But “with each passing year” of Iraq’s defiance, there had “been a growing awareness
of the immense consequences of a failure to match our words with actions”, and:
“The stakes could not be higher. If the UN proves unable to act on the spirit and
the letter of mandatory Chapter VII resolutions when faced with the most egregious
non-compliance it risks joining its predecessor, the League of Nations, as a footnote
in history.”
691.  Mr Straw said that, without military pressure on Iraq, there would be “no
co‑operation; no inspections”. Mr Straw also stated that the threat of military action
was “and always has been, about pressuring Saddam Hussein to comply with
resolution 1441”.
692.  In preparation for visits to key capitals to pursue support for the UK’s position,
Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, informed Sir David Manning that a script
was being prepared which would:
“… briefly summarise evidence and judgements on Saddam’s WMD, describe the
effect of some of the agents; set out the Iraqi response to UNSCR 1441, including
the flaws in the 7 December declaration; and cover what we know of concealment,
intimidation of witnesses and other aspects of non-co-operation. It will also provide
supporting material on Saddam’s regime and – briefly – on links with terrorism.
We will update the pack as new material becomes available.”196
693.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, during a briefing for E10 representatives
in New York on 21 February, he had made clear that the UK viewed war as a last
resort, but the objective of disarming Iraq had to be achieved and the threat could not
be allowed to continue for much longer. Verified disarmament had not happened; and
no-one had explained how inspections could work without Iraq’s co-operation. The UK
supported the UN as a relevant international body, and did not favour unilateral action.
Sir Jeremy stated:
“We had to factor in the US determination to deal with Iraq … [The UK was]
prepared to work with the E10 members to achieve a unified Council keeping the
pressure on Saddam and perhaps allowing him to crack.”197

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

694.  The UK strategy was set out in a telegram from Mr Ricketts to diplomatic posts
on the evening of 21 February.198 The key points were:
“The present plan is to table a simple draft resolution in the Security Council,
probably on 24 February. This would provide the … legal authority for military action
if necessary. We would make clear that it was part of a strategy to give Iraq another
short period in which to demonstrate finally and fully whether it was co-operating in
order to achieve voluntary disarmament of its WMD. We would … not be seeking a
vote … for another two weeks or so, but were not prepared for the process to string
out in the absence of a clear will by Iraq to comply with 1441.
“… we would expect several further rounds of discussion in the Security Council
… culminating in a report by the inspectors to a meeting on or around 7 March,
probably attended by Foreign Ministers.”
695.  Mr Ricketts advised that there would be an intensive lobbying campaign of the
elected members of the Security Council with a “good deal of travel by Ministers”.
The campaign would be co-ordinated with the US and Spain. The FCO would be setting
up a system to “provide an up-date at least twice a week while the crisis remains at its
present pitch”, and was producing a daily “core script” for media purposes.
696.  In a letter to Mr Campbell about statements over the weekend of 22 and
23 February, Mr Straw advised against any reference to either an “ultimatum” or to
“benchmarks”.199 Mr Straw explained that the US was hostile to the use of the former
term because “it would cut across a real ultimatum which President Bush had in mind
to issue at about the time the resolution was voted – to Saddam to ‘get out of town’”.
697.  On benchmarks, there was:
“… a trap here for us to avoid. If we are too specific about how we judge Saddam’s
compliance, we set ourselves up as a target, both from Saddam but also from Blix.
Saddam will know what he appears to have to do to get ticks in the right boxes.
Judging from the Prime Minister’s conversation with Blix yesterday, I think Blix is
also in the mood to say if he possibly can that Iraq has passed any benchmarks
that we offer. Most of the members of the Security Council will look to Blix for
their judgement.”
698.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that, on 21 February, Mr Blair, who was on his
way to Rome, had called him to say that “everything now had to be set in the context
of pushing for peace, that we wanted to resolve it peacefully”. Mr Campbell had worked
with the White House on a briefing note. Mr Blair and Mr Straw had been happy to
include a reference to an ultimatum until Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell “who

said the real ultimatum would be made just before action when we tell Saddam to get
out of town”.200
699.  In his press conference with Mr Berlusconi on 21 February, Mr Blair warned that
military action on Iraq could not be avoided unless Saddam Hussein chose “the route of
peaceful disarmament”.201 Mr Blair emphasised that no one wanted war. That was why:
“… last summer, instead of starting a war, we went to the UN …
“But there is a moral dimension to this question too. If we fail to disarm Saddam
peacefully, then where does that leave the authority of the UN?
“And if we leave Saddam in charge of Iraq with his weapons of mass destruction,
where does that leave the Iraqi people who are the principal victims of Saddam?”
700.  Asked about the opposition to conflict expressed by church leaders, Mr Blair
replied:
“I don’t pretend to have a monopoly of wisdom … and I totally understand why
people don’t want war …
“That’s the very reason why we have given every single opportunity for this
to be resolved peacefully. All I ask people to do is understand that however
sincerely they hold their view, I hold my view sincerely too. And there is another
side to this argument.
“I understand exactly why people feel so strongly, but in the end, I have got to make
a decision and that’s the difference between leadership and commentary.
“I have got to make a decision. If we cannot disarm him peacefully, are we just going
to ignore the issue and hope it will go away?”
701.  Late that evening, there was a conference call, including Dr Rice,
Mr Stephen Hadley (US Deputy National Security Advisor), Sir David Manning and
Mr Powell as well as Mr Campbell.202 The US was worried about the text, which
included “a side statement directly challenging Saddam”. In his diaries, Mr Campbell
wrote that Dr Rice:
“… feared that setting it out as a final chance – again – or a challenge to Saddam,
suggested there was something here beyond 1441. She said 1441 was all that we
needed. We tried to use the call to get over the need for a different sort of language
on this, but they really didn’t get it.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

702.  Mr Campbell added that despite five phone calls including the conference call, the
US and UK:
“… were not really in the same place. I could sense that Condi thought we were
weakening. She really didn’t like the final, final opportunity line, couldn’t see it was
simply a way of trying to show we preferred peace to war …”
703.  Mr Campbell told Dr Rice that she had to understand “we were hit hard here
because people felt we were rushing to a timetable set by others”.
704.  On 23 February, Mr Blair spoke to President Putin who was prepared to work
on a second resolution which put tougher requirements on Saddam Hussein, but
President Putin did not think it should provide an automatic start to hostilities.203
705.  Mr Blair also spoke to Mr Vicente Fox, the Mexican President,204 and
Mr Ricardo Lagos, the Chilean President.205
706.  Mr Straw and Sir David Manning also made a number of telephone calls.
707.  Mr Straw spoke to Mr de Villepin on 23 February about French concerns that
pushing for a second resolution was premature and indicated that the US and the UK
had no faith in the inspection process.206
708.  On 24 February, Mr Campbell wrote that “Iraq was totally dominating” and he had
suggested in Mr Blair’s morning meeting that “something concrete, like signs of Arab
pressure, or a new diplomatic effort that meant something” was “needed to add some
substance to the ‘last push for peace’, which at the moment just sounded vacuous”.207
Mr Blair “said the last push WAS the pressure being applied, or the pressure was the last
push”, which Mr Campbell “still felt looked like we were trying to meet a US timetable,
not genuinely trying to avoid war. But all the US politicians did was communicate an
impatience to get to war.”

Response to the draft resolution of 24 February 2003
709.  The UK, US and Spain tabled a draft resolution on 24 February stating simply
that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 and that
the Security Council had decided to remain seized of the matter.

710.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that resolution 1441 required Iraq “visibly
and unmistakably to divest itself of weapons of mass destruction immediately,
unconditionally and actively”; that had not happened and the US and UK had
concluded that Iraq had decided to defy the international community.
711.  A meeting of the Security Council was held on 24 February at the request
of the UK.208
712.  A draft of a second resolution was tabled by the UK, US and Spain. The draft
operative paragraphs stated simply that the Security Council:

•	
•	

“Decides that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it by
resolution 1441”; and
“Decides to remain seized of the matter.”209

713.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Security Council that:
“The co-sponsors are convinced that Iraq is not achieving, nor intending to achieve,
the objective of SCR 1441 … its unanimous message represented a powerful
signal that the UN was in control. The Security Council was challenged by the
US President to raise its game on its most difficult agenda item … The resolution
set out the most stringent terms ever decided upon by the United Nations for the
process of disarmament. But there was also an olive branch … Iraq was given every
incentive to repair its documented non-compliance.
“Today, 15 weeks on … we are no further advanced towards that objective of
complete disarmament. Indeed, nor is Iraq taking adequate steps to correct its wider
breaches of 687, including its support for terrorism. The terms of resolution 1441 are
not being respected …”210
714.  Sir Jeremy stated:
“What we all asked of Iraq was, first, a marked change from its denial and
deception of 1991 to 2002, which had already placed it in material breach of
relevant resolutions; and second, full compliance with and co-operation with the
implementation of 1441. In other words, a decision by Iraq visibly and unmistakably
to divest itself of weapons of mass destruction immediately, unconditionally and
actively. That means bringing proscribed materials or programmes to the notice of
inspectors and providing a full and credible account of Iraq’s WMD activity backed
up by documentary evidence and testimony from personnel.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“What 1441 was not was the establishment of a detective or a containment
exercise … The final opportunity afforded in SCR 1441 was not for the Council
to slide back into process, but for Iraq to recognise a new determination in the
Security Council to complete the business in a way which represented a complete
change of attitude in Baghdad.
“That has not happened.”
715.  Sir Jeremy said that the UK was “convinced” that Iraq had “decided to remain
in defiance of the UN”. The reasons included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq had “only agreed to inspections” after President Bush’s speech on
12 September 2002 “in a cynical attempt to scupper any new resolution
strengthening them”.
The Iraqi letter of 13 November 2002 was “full of tirades and complaints”,
“grudgingly accepting that it would ‘deal with’ the resolution”. That was “way
short of the wholehearted commitment to voluntary disarmament we had
hoped for”.
Iraq’s 12,000 page declaration was “indisputably inadequate”.
Iraq had “done everything possible to prevent unrestricted interviews”.
Iraq had “dragged its feet on as many other elements of procedural co-operation
as possible. Instead of serious collaboration with the inspectors, Iraq has tried
to make the process into a tightly monitored media circus …”
“Iraq’s co-operation on substance has been non-existent … UNMOVIC have not
been able to close a single outstanding issue … And there are now even more
unresolved questions …”
“This continues … an all too familiar pattern of Iraq trying to get us to focus
on small concessions of process, rather than on the big picture … there is no
semblance of whole-hearted co-operation … nothing like a regime with nothing
to hide …”

716.  Sir Jeremy concluded that the UK was seeking:
“… to keep the Council in control of the process and to build renewed Council
consensus … that Iraq has made the wrong choice: the choice not to take … the
final opportunity voluntarily to disarm … We shall, in detailed discussions, set out
further the argument that this choice has been made, that the choice is a defiance of
1441 and the available remedies are fast disappearing.”
717.  The UK was “not asking for any instant judgements”: there was “time still … for
Iraq to make the right choice”. The UK would not “call for a vote … until a proper debate
has been held”. There was:
“… still an opportunity to avert conflict. But the Council’s judgement that Iraq has
made the wrong choice should be clear and consensual. The last chance for peace

306

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

is that the Council should say this together and formally, confront Baghdad with
the stark implications, and trust … the response will be complete disarmament which
we demanded … in SCR 687 [1991] …”
718.  Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, asked Sir Jeremy
for the “additional facts justifying” his reference to Iraq’s support for terrorism. Sir Jeremy
reported that Mr Lavrov also stated that the “allegations being levelled against Iraq”
addressed the process of disarmament, not the substance.211
719.  In subsequent remarks to the press, Sir Jeremy stated that resolution 1441 “had
set out the terms. Iraq had failed to co-operate. The draft resolution was about taking
the hard decisions that followed.”212
720.  Asked by the Inquiry why the UK had tabled that draft resolution when, unlike
UNSCOM in December 1998, Dr Blix had stated he was getting co-operation on
process, Mr Blair replied:
“Whether he thought the action was justified or not, his reports were clear
that the compliance was not immediate and the co-operation unconditional.
It plainly wasn’t.”213
721.  Mr Blair added that he did not believe that “if Dr Blix had another six months,
it would have come out any differently”. Saddam Hussein “was definitely in material
breach” of resolution 1441; Mr Blair “had to decide” whether his (Saddam Hussein’s)
behaviour “really” indicated that he was “someone who had had a change of heart”.
722.  Asked if there was a risk in tabling the resolution that it would appear that the
UK was trying to curtail the process because of the demands of military planning,
Mr Blair replied:
“It was more, actually … the other way round … what we were trying to do was to
say: how do you resolve what, on any basis, is a somewhat indistinct picture being
painted by Dr Blix …
“… I think we [Mr Blair and Dr Blix] … had a long conversation on the phone.
I remember Jack Straw was very much involved in this. Jeremy Greenstock, I think,
at the UN, was very much involved in this. We tried to construct these tests, and the
most important one, to me, was this ability to get the scientists out of the country.”214

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

723.  France, Germany and Russia responded by tabling a memorandum which
proposed strengthening inspections and bringing forward the work programme
specified in resolution 1284 and accelerating its timetable.
724.  France, Germany and Russia responded to the draft resolution by tabling a
memorandum, building on the earlier tripartite declaration of 10 February, stating that
“full and effective disarmament” remained “the imperative objective of the international
community”.215 That “should be achieved peacefully through the inspection regime”.
The “conditions for using force” had “not been fulfilled”. The memorandum stated that
the Security Council “must step up its efforts to give a real chance to the peaceful
settlement of the crisis”. A “combination of a clear programme of action, reinforced
inspections, a clear timeline and the military build-up” provided “a realistic means
to unite the Security Council and to exert maximum pressure on Iraq”.
725.  Canada also circulated ideas for a process based on key tasks identified
by UNMOVIC.
726.  In a “non-paper” circulated on 24 February, Canada set out its ideas on
establishing “a defined process for a specific period of time to address the
Iraq situation”.216
727.  The document stated that the Security Council divisions on Iraq “could have
serious long-term implications for the UN and for international peace and stability”;
and that both sides of the division had a point:
“•	 An open-ended inspection process would relieve the pressure on the Iraqis
to disarm.

•	

A truncated process would leave doubt that war was a last resort.”

728.  Canada suggested that the inspectors should bring forward their “clusters”
document “early” on 28 February and provide the Council with a prioritised list
of key substantive tasks for Iraq to accomplish. The inspectors would then provide
four, weekly, reports on the substance with a final report on 28 March for discussion
at a Ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council on 31 March.
729.  If the 28 March report indicated that Iraq had not complied, “all necessary means
could be used to force them to disarm”. If Iraq co-operated “an enhanced inspection,
verification and monitoring system would be implemented”.
730.  Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair on 26 February that the paper was “unhelpful”.

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

731.  The UK began an intense and determined effort to secure support for the
draft resolution.
732.  Between the discussion in the Security Council on 24 February and the reports
to the Security Council from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March, the UK, US and Spain
began an intense and determined effort to try to persuade the members of the Council,
and other allies, to support the draft resolution.
733.  The campaign included letters from Mr Blair, telephone calls, meetings and visits
by Ministers and Sir David Manning, as well as discussions in New York and capitals
and public statements in the US and UK.
734.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed developments on 25 February and
the “troublesome” implications of the request for more time. Mr Straw commented that
“everyone was running for cover, finding any reason not to take action”. In the tea room
of the House of Commons, he had “found much support for continued containment as
the best way of avoiding unintended consequences”.217
735.  Iraq was reported to have “dominated” the discussion during a meeting and lunch
between Mr Straw and Mr Fischer on 25 February.218
736.  The record stated that “there was no meeting of minds”. Mr Fischer had:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

made it clear that Germany could not vote for the UK/US/Spanish resolution,
which in “German eyes would lead directly to war”;
questioned why the inspections should stop now;
suggested that destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles would “prove resolution
1441 was working”, and that there were “other hopeful signs”;
stated that the German/French/Russian joint memorandum set out the only
process that would lead to peace; containment was working; and
stated that “war would lead to serious repercussions; increased terrorism;
insecurity in the Middle East”.

737.  Mr Straw was reported to have argued that the problem with Saddam Hussein
was that: “he had history of ‘stringing it out’. He only made concessions which
represented the bare minimum, under the threat of force, and at the last minute.” The
joint memorandum “made the error of putting the burden on the inspectors to find Iraq’s
weapons of mass destruction”; and that it “would merely lead to loose containment not
disarmament”. The burden should be on Saddam Hussein; he “could comply quickly”
and, as Mr Blair had said, “if Saddam complied, then he could stay in power”. The joint

memorandum “simply created the message that Saddam wanted to hear; that the
international community was divided”.
738.  In a letter to Sir David Manning on 25 February, Mr Straw’s Private Office identified
the core arguments for the UK to use in persuading other members of the Security
Council to support the resolution as:
“•	 There is an objective case against Iraq. We have given inspections 12 years
already. SCR 1441 (2002) set clear benchmarks – immediate, unconditional
and active co-operation. Iraqi co-operation has not been forthcoming.

•	
•	
•	

More time will make no difference. Inspections are not a detective agency.
How many last chances can you have?
The authority of the UN is at stake. Collective threats in a globalised world
means taking on threats where they emerge …
It is in no-one’s interest to see the US go unilateral. We need to show the
US that the UN can play a constructive role.”219

739.  Following their discussion of the next steps on 25 February, Sir David reported that
Dr Rice thought there would be no vetoes of the resolution.220
740.  President Chirac’s position was identified as important but Mr Blair decided
to wait for “the right moment” to resume their dialogue.
741.  Sir John Holmes wrote to Sir David Manning on 24 February offering advice on
the way ahead.221 He recommended that it remained important that Mr Blair continued
to talk to President Chirac, “even if there is at present no chance of changing his mind”.
There would be “the usual problems about who picks up the phone first” but it would
be “much easier to attempt any final persuasion if we have kept up a dialogue”.
742.  Recognising that it was “outside my province, and very much for” Sir Jeremy
Greenstock, Sir John also wrote:
“… the assumption here is that the French will not have to veto if we cannot
assemble nine positive votes … But have we thought about going ahead with a
vote even if we know we cannot get nine positive votes? Might there not be value
in a vote with six or seven positive votes and everyone else abstaining – it would
be a diplomatic failure in one sense, but if no-one had voted against, perhaps more
of a political mandate than otherwise? There might of course still be the risk of a
French vote against, but would they really want to do it in these circumstances? It is
obviously too soon to know how all this will play out in the end, but it might be worth
keeping the thought in mind.”

743.  Sir David Manning commented that he was not sure Mr Blair would have much
enthusiasm for Sir John’s first recommendation, but it was worth “bearing the argument
in mind”.222 Sir David agreed with Sir John’s second point.
744.  Mr Blair replied: “We sh[oul]d wait ‘til the right moment.”223
745.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock remained concerned about the lack of support in the
Security Council and the implications, including the legal implications, of putting
the resolution to a vote and failing to get it adopted.
746.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that in the circumstances Sir John Holmes had
identified (fewer than nine positive votes but everyone else abstaining), the resolution
would not be adopted and it would have no legal effect.224 He found it:
“… hard to see how we could draw much legal comfort from such an outcome; but
an authoritative determination would be a matter for the Law Officers. (Kosovo was
different: in that case a Russian draft condemning the NATO action as illegal was
heavily defeated, leaving open the claim that the action was lawful … (or at least
was so regarded by the majority of the Council).)
“Furthermore, in the current climate … the political mandate to be drawn from a
draft which failed to achieve nine positive votes seems to me likely to be (at best)
weak … The stark reality would remain that the US and UK had tried and failed
to persuade the Council to endorse the use of force against Iraq. And the French
(and the Russians and Chinese) would no doubt be sitting comfortably among
the abstainers …
“My feeling … is that our interests are better served by not putting a draft to a vote
unless we were sure that it had sufficient votes to be adopted … But we should
revisit this issue later – a lot still had still to be played out in the Council.”
747.  Following discussions with the US and Spanish Missions in New York on
25 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the “key arguments” in relation
to Canadian and other benchmarking proposals were:
“•	 it was impossible accurately to define key remaining disarmament tasks,
or other benchmarks, in the absence of Iraqi co-operation …

•	
•	

the Council had to accept there would never be total clarity …

•	

the big picture was that we were being taken for a ride …”225

1441 set the benchmarks for Iraqi co-operation, benchmarks it had manifestly
failed; and

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

748.  Mexico had raised questions about the legal effect of the UK draft and whether it
signalled that peaceful means had been exhausted and whether a third Council decision
would be needed for the use of force.
749.  Sir Jeremy suggested that “consistent with being legally accurate”, the “most
persuasive answers” might be along the lines that:
“•	 the resolution itself asked the Council to conclude that Iraq had failed to take
its final opportunity to comply. This was something on which, given Iraq’s pattern
of non co-operation, the Council should be able to unite;

•	
•	

the consequence of that judgement, deriving from 1441 and previous
resolutions, was that force would be authorised;
this did not mean that the resolution would lead to the use of force or that
peaceful means were exhausted. Rather, with a clear Council decision … there
was still a chance of last minute radical moves by the Iraqis. We recognised that
the probability of Iraq taking that chance … was low, but it was perhaps the only
route by which we could secure disarmament and a peaceful outcome.”

750.  Sir Jeremy also reported that Mr Lavrov had suggested the inspectors had said
that there were no false statements and Iraq’s submission of 30 documents might have
rectified the omissions in the declaration.
751.  Sir Jeremy emphasised the importance of the Council meeting on 27 February
and asked for “additional detailed punchy arguments” he could deploy.
752.  Reporting discussions in New York on 26 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote:

•	
•	

•	

There remained “a general antipathy to having now to take decisions on
this issue, and a wariness about what our underlying motives are behind
the resolution”.
The German position was that the process of inspections had not been
exhausted; the work programme and key tasks envisaged in resolution 1284,
which had not been revoked, had not begun; it had good reason to suspect that
that Iraq had WMD, but there was no proof and it could turn out that Saddam
Hussein was telling the truth.
The US position was that resolution 1441 had found Iraq in material breach
and partial compliance would not do. Continued inspections was, in effect,
an argument for containment; and “Business as usual” would not produce the
radical Iraqi transformation needed. The US was willing to ensure disarmament
by itself if necessary and the Council had to factor that into its decisions.226

753.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had argued that the UK had not given up on a peaceful
outcome. The second resolution would maximise pressure on Saddam Hussein and

312

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

there was still a chance for him to make a last minute decision to leave or genuinely
yield all his WMD. The UK:
“… wanted a further Council decision because we wanted it to stay in control of this
issue. Saddam’s assertion that he had no WMD made benchmarks a pipe‑dream –
how could we benchmark something the Iraqis said did not exist? Having
unanimously adopted 1441, we could not go back to extended inspections under
1284 … The fact … that Iraq was not fully co-operating – was the point. If colleagues
believed that Iraq was co-operating fully, then it was justified to vote against the text
or amend it. If they voted against the text for any other reason, they were denying
what was unanimously agreed in resolution 1441.”
754.  Sir Jeremy concluded that the US was focused on preserving its room for
manoeuvre while he was “concentrating on trying to win votes”. It was the “middle
ground” that mattered. They “resent[ed] being forced to choose” between the P5
and wanted “to come to an objective judgement”. Mexico and Chile were the “pivotal
sceptics”; and “effective arguments (and intelligence evidence) to show that Iraq’s zero
is a huge lie are going to be more productive … in bringing them over”.
755.  Sir Jeremy also reported that an UNMOVIC contact regarded letters received
from the Iraqis in the last few days, which included names of people involved in the
destruction of VX, as showing that the Iraqis were trying to be active.
756.  The UK considered that the Franco/German/Russian proposals were
“misconceived”.
757.  The UK viewed the Franco/German/Russian approach as “misconceived”.
A telegram to posts setting out the UK position on 26 February:

•	

•	

Questioned the assertion that there was no evidence that Iraq still possessed
WMD. That was a “Fundamental misunderstanding of the inspections process”,
which had “to date left very large questions unanswered – particularly about Iraqi
chemical and biological programmes”. It was “not for others to prove that Iraq
has got WMD, but for Iraq to prove that it has not, through full, immediate and
active co-operation with the inspectors as required by resolution 1441”. It was
“an extraordinary statement”. “Substantial evidence”, including the September
dossier, had been presented “of continuing Iraqi programmes and capabilities”.
Described Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council on 5 February
as having “offered extensive evidence of Iraqi activities to hinder inspections”.
In addition, in relation to specific provisions in resolution 1441, “no interviews
have taken place with individuals … under the conditions requested”; the Iraqis
had complied with the requirement to provide names of personnel “partially,
belatedly, and under pressure”; and the inspectors had faced “obstruction
and delay in attempting to search sites”. For example, on 16 January they
were obstructed by Iraqi officials when they attempted to enter a scientist’s

private home. After insisting on their rights, the inspectors discovered a cache
of documents on nuclear enrichment.
Asserted that the proposals put the onus on the Security Council, not “where
it should be – on Iraq”.
Asked how offering more time would increase the pressure on Iraq.
Questioned how identifying key tasks would oblige Iraq to co-operate as “even
when requirements are stated very clearly”, as in resolution 1441, Iraq complied
“belatedly, grudgingly, partially or not at all”.
Stated that none of the proposals for strengthening inspections could be
implemented quickly.
Questioned the need to allow 120 days for a report on progress in completing
key tasks: “we already have ample evidence to the contrary”.
Stated that it was: “Disingenuous to express support (indeed encouragement)
for the military build-up while at the same time making proposals which
would require forces to be held at a high state of readiness for a wholly
unrealistic period.”227

Parliament, 25 and 26 February 2003
758.  Mr Straw published key documents on Iraq on 25 February.
759.  Mr Straw stated that Iraq continued to pose the clearest possible threat to
international peace and security. He still hoped that Iraq would comply, but if it did
not, he hoped the international community would recognise its responsibilities.
760.  During Oral Questions to the Foreign Secretary on 25 February, Mr Straw
announced the publication of a Command Paper on Iraq.228
761.  The Command Paper was “intended to bring together in an easily accessible form
some of the key international documents relevant to the Iraq crisis”. It comprised:

•	
•	
•	

key Security Council resolutions;

•	

statements by the European Union on 13 December 2002 and 27 January and
17 February 2003;

•	

the report of the Amorim Panel in 1999;
the briefings to the Security Council by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 27 January
and 14 February 2003;

Mr Straw’s statements to the Security Council of 20 January, 5 February and
14 February 2003.229

762.  Mr Straw told Ms Annabelle Ewing (Scottish National Party):
“… Iraq has been, and remains in material breach of a string of very clear obligations
that have been imposed on it. It has had a final opportunity to deal with those
violations … but continues to pose the clearest possible threat to international
peace and security through its possession of weapons of mass destruction and
long-range missiles, and its defiance of international law. I hope that the whole
of the international community will recognise the responsibilities borne by it and
by individual members of the Security Council to ensure that international law means
what it says. I still hope that we can gain enforcement by peaceful means but, if we
cannot, the serious consequences … we spelled out in … resolution 1441 will have
to follow through.”230
763.  Subsequently, in response to Ms Joan Ruddock (Labour), Mr Straw stated:
“I continue to hope that a vote [on the draft resolution] can be avoided because the
purpose of the resolution is to serve very clear notice on Saddam … that the final
opportunity has nearly passed.”231
764.  In a statement on 25 February, Mr Blair rehearsed the Government’s strategy.
765.  On 25 February, Mr Blair made a statement in the House of Commons on Iraq.232
766.  Mr Blair provided a brief history of the crisis in which he emphasised Saddam
Hussein’s concealment of his biological and nuclear weapons programmes from the
inspectors and his continued deception.
767.  Mr Blair stated that the intelligence was “clear” that Saddam Hussein continued
“to believe that his weapons of mass destruction programme is essential both for internal
repression and for external aggression”. It was also “essential to his regional power”.
“Prior to the inspectors coming back in”, Saddam Hussein “was engaged in a systematic
exercise in concealment of those weapons”. The inspectors had reported some
co‑operation on process, but had “denied progress on substance”.
768.  Mr Blair said that the UK, US and Spain had introduced a resolution deciding
that Iraq had “failed to take the final opportunity”, but would “not put the resolution
to a vote immediately” to “give Saddam one further final chance to disarm voluntarily”.
The UN inspectors would have a further report to make in March but the time had come
for Saddam Hussein to decide. Peaceful disarmament required active co-operation.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

769.  Mr Blair said that the memorandum put forward by France, Germany and Russia
called “for more time – up to the end of July at least”. But the issue was not time but will.
The risk was that Saddam Hussein wanted to drag the process out until the attention of
the international community waned.
770.  Mr Blair emphasised that the objective was disarmament but “the nature of
Saddam’s regime was relevant”, first because “weapons of mass destruction in the
hands of a regime of this brutality” were “especially dangerous, in particular because
Saddam has chosen his willingness to use them”. Secondly, the innocent were dying
in Iraq every day.
771.  Mr Blair concluded that the authority of the United Nations and the international
community was at stake. If that was not upheld, the consequences would “stretch far
beyond Iraq”.
772.  In response to questions about the threat posed by Iraq, Mr Blair stated that
that the “whole basis of resolution 1441” was that Saddam Hussein constituted a
threat, adding:
“Moreover, there is a whole set of related dangers to do with unstable states
developing or proliferating such material and with potential links to terrorism.
That is why, in the end, the world has to take a very strong view of the matter
and deal with it.”
773.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had called him later and said:
“… it was going to be really tough from now on in. The truth was we may well have
to go without a second UNSCR, or even without a majority on the UNSC. The Bush
poodle problem would get bigger … but he was adamant it was the right thing to do,
and worth the political consequences.”233
774.  Mr Campbell added that “an awful lot” of Labour MPs were “committed to rebellion”
and were asking if Iraq was a threat “to us, and now”? Mr Blair was “dismissive” of
Dr Blix; he had “said his job was to set out the facts, but he now saw his mission as
to stop war”.
775.  In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote that Mr Blair had been:
“… at his most effective. He was convincing and passionate about his own belief
in the correctness of his course of action …
“However, no amount of skilled presentation could conceal the immense confusion
that we are in over the role of the UN. Tony knows that he desperately needs the
blessing of the UN if he is to have any chance of carrying domestic opinion with him,

but since he knows that Bush will go to war whatever the UN says, Tony’s attempt
to wrap himself in the UN flag is fatally hobbled by his inability to say that the UN
will have the last word.”234
776.  Mr Cook added that Mr Blair’s exchanges with backbenchers had “clearly laid out
the nexus of issues which have brought him to his present conviction”. That was that
“proliferation, plus unstable states plus terrorism adds up to a new and serious threat”.
That was:
“… a way of linking action against Saddam to the response to 9/11, and avoids the
irritating evidence that Saddam has no link whatsoever to 9/11 and has no link with
Al Qaida. But it does still leave unanswered why Iraq is the focus of so much effort.
Whatever else we may say about the Iraqi regime, it is not unstable …”
777.  Asked by Mr Duncan Smith during PMQs on 26 February whether he would
support action in the absence of a majority in the Security Council, Mr Blair responded
that he believed that there would be support for a second resolution.235
778.  Mr Blair subsequently stated that he was “working flat out” to achieve a second
resolution, and that the best way to do that was “to hold firm to the terms of resolution
1441”. That required “full, unconditional and immediate compliance” from Iraq, and was
intended “genuinely to be the final opportunity” for Saddam Hussein.236
779.  The House of Commons was asked on 26 February to reaffirm its
endorsement of resolution 1441, to support the Government’s continuing efforts
to disarm Iraq, and to call upon Iraq to recognise that this was its final opportunity
to comply with its obligations.
780.  The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124; 199 MPs voted
for an amendment which invited the House to “find the case for military action
against Iraq as yet unproven”.
781.  The Government motion tabled for debate on 26 February invited the
House of Commons to:
“Take note of Command Paper Cm 5769 on Iraq; reaffirm its endorsement of
United Nations Security Council resolution 1441, as expressed in its resolution
of 25 November 2002; support the Government’s continuing efforts in the United
Nations to disarm Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction; and call upon Iraq to
recognise this is its final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations.”237

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

782.  In his statement opening the debate, Mr Straw said that the motion meant what
it said. It was “not an endorsement of military action” and no decision “to deploy British
forces in action” had “yet been taken”.238 Any decision on military action would be put
to the House and “subject only to the usual caveat about the safety of our forces”. It was
“as much in the Government’s interest as it is in the paramount interest of the House,
that we should do so before the start of hostilities”. The House would be kept informed
on the business of the Security Council and have “a full opportunity to debate and vote
on the outcome of proceedings on any second resolution”.
783.  Stating that he intended to answer the “central and continuing question in people’s
minds”, Mr Straw said that the 13 Security Council resolutions in the Command Paper
provided the best answer to the question “Why Iraq?” They showed “paragraph by
paragraph, the exceptional danger posed by Iraq, and its continued defiance of the
United Nations”. Iraq had “flatly and completely” refused to comply with resolution 1284
(1999). Resolution 1441 gave Iraq its “final opportunity”. Iraq was the “only country in
such serious and multiple breach of mandatory UN obligations”.
784.  In response to the question “Why now?”, Mr Straw stated that Saddam Hussein’s
aim was that “now” should never arrive. His tactics were to “prevaricate in the hope that
by exploiting people’s natural anxieties” he could “string out the process forever and
keep his arsenal”. Since the inspectors’ return to Iraq, Saddam Hussein had not provided
new evidence and there were concerted Iraqi efforts to prevent unrestricted interviews
with scientists. The inspectors had not been able to close a single outstanding issue.
785.  In response to calls for “more time and more inspections”, Mr Straw said that in
the absence of active and immediate Iraqi co-operation, more time would not achieve
anything of substance. The disarmament of South Africa had taken nine inspectors and
three years. The “grudging concessions on process” from Saddam Hussein had been
“secured only because of the military build up”. Saddam Hussein “must either embark
immediately on voluntary and full disarmament or the Security Council must face
up to its responsibility to see that he is disarmed by force”.
786.  Iraq had made “a string of cynically timed concessions” that were “calculated
to divide and delay”. A second resolution was needed to “bring this game to a halt”.
If the words “final opportunity” in resolution 1441 were to have any meaning, it was that
Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to “lure the international community into endless
indecision”. Saddam Hussein:
“… would use a further 120 days to bring the authority of the United Nations lower
week by week, to tie the weapons inspectors in knots, and create further divisions
within the international community.”

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

787.  Mr Straw added:
“Worse, this delay would send Saddam the clearest possible signal that his strategy
is succeeding. It would tell him that the international community lacked the will
to disarm him, and it would tell all those who threaten our security that Saddam
Hussein has broken the United Nations as an instrument for defending peace
through the force of international law.”
788.  Mr Straw argued against persisting with a policy of containment. That was “not the
policy of disarmament as set out in resolution 1441 or any of the preceding resolutions”.
There could be “no stable, steady state for Iraq unless it is properly disarmed”. Nor could
there be stability for the region and the international community: “What may appear
to be containment to others is rearmament for Saddam.” “Far from keeping a lid on
Saddam’s ambitions”, the policy of containment between 1998 and 2002 had “allowed
him to rebuild his horrific arsenal, his chemical and biological weapons, and the means
of delivering them”. Mr Straw cited Iraq’s refurbishment of prohibited equipment and the
building of a missile test stand as proof of that activity. Containment required “a degree
of trust in Saddam that we cannot risk and which runs contrary to all the evidence”.
789.  In relation to questions about double standards, especially in relation to Israel
and Palestine, Mr Straw said that he and Mr Blair accepted that there had been a
“considerable amount to that charge” but the way to deal with that was “not by ignoring
outstanding UN obligations, but by working even harder to see all of them implemented”.
The UK was “working actively to implement” UN policy on Israel/Palestine “including the
early publication of the Road Map”.
790.  Mr Straw stated:
“International terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are the
crucial strategic questions of our time. Our answer to the threats will determine the
stability of the world for decades to come. This is an awesome responsibility. It calls
for courageous leadership and it requires a vision and foresight to act decisively
and, if necessary, with military force.”
791.  Mr Straw concluded that a “moment of choice” had been reached for Saddam
Hussein and for the Iraqi regime, and for the United Nations. The:
“… issue of what we do about tyrannical states with poison gases, nerve agents,
viruses and nuclear ambitions, and which defy international law and the principles
of the UN, will not go away. We have to face the issue. We have to give Saddam
Hussein a categorical choice, and after 12 long years he has to give us his
answer now.”

319

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Points made during the debate
The debate that followed Mr Straw’s statement returned repeatedly to the question of
whether the inspectors should be given more time, and whether the case had yet been
made that military action was necessary.239 A number of MPs referred to the need for
an authorising UN resolution if action was to go ahead, and for plans for the delivery
of humanitarian aid to Iraq.
Mr Chris Smith (Labour) told the House that there must be “the clearest possible reasons”
for going to war and risking thousands of lives, and added “I do not believe those reasons
are there”.
Mr Kenneth Clarke (Conservative) said: “I cannot rid myself of doubts that the course to
war upon which we are now embarked was decided on many months ago, primarily in
Washington, and there has been a fairly remorseless unfolding of events since that time.”
That point was echoed by Mr John Gummer (Conservative), who said: “There is
no Member of Parliament who does not know that this war is war by timetable, and
the timetable was laid before the United States had any intention of going to the
United Nations.”

792.  After the debate, 199 MPs voted for an amendment to the Government
motion which invited the House to “find the case for military action against Iraq
as yet unproven”.
793.  The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124.
794.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on 27 February to explain the political
difficulties in the UK:
“Yesterday’s outcome [in the House of Commons] emphasised in stark terms that
a second resolution was absolutely vital …”240
795.  Mr Cook wrote that it was the largest rebellion against the Government in his
30 years in Parliament, and that the newspapers the following morning had described it
as the “biggest government rebellion since Gladstone introduced the Home Rule Bill”.241

President Bush’s speech, 26 February 2003
796.  In a speech on 26 February intended to make the case for action against Iraq,
President Bush stated that the safety of the American people depended on ending
the direct and growing threat from Iraq.
797.  President Bush also set out his hopes for the future of Iraq.

798.  In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute on 26 February, President Bush
stated that Saddam Hussein was “building and hiding weapons that could enable him
to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world”; and that the US would
“not allow it”.242 In addition, Saddam Hussein had “close ties to terrorist organizations,
and could supply them with terrible means to strike” the US. The danger that posed
“could not be ignored or wished away” and “must be confronted”. The US hoped:
“… that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm,
fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force.
Either way, this danger will be removed.
“The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing
threat. Acting … will also contribute greatly to the long-term safety and stability
of our world … A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform this
vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions.”
799.  If it “must use force”, the United States and “our coalition” stood ready to: “help
the citizens of a liberated Iraq”; “lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work
of destroying chemical and biological weapons”; “provide security against those who
try to spread chaos, or settle scores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq”; and
“protect Iraq’s natural resources from sabotage … and ensure those resources are
used for the benefit of the owners – the Iraqi people”.
800.  The US had “no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq’s new
government”; that choice belonged to the Iraqi people. But the US would “ensure
that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another”:
“All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government and all citizens must have their
rights protected.
“Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations …
we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more … in the peace
that followed a world war … we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left
constitutions and parliaments. We established an atmosphere of safety, in which
responsible, reform-minded local leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom
…
“… The nation of Iraq – with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilled
and educated people – is fully capable of moving towards democracy and living
in freedom.”
801.  A new regime in Iraq would:
“… serve as dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations
in the region …
242 

The White House, 26 February 2003, President discusses the future of Iraq.

321

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace and set
in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state. The passing of
Saddam Hussein’s regime will deprive terrorist networks … of a wealthy patron …
And other regimes will be given a clear warning that support for terror would not
be tolerated.”
802.  President Bush also stated that a future Palestinian state must abandon for ever
the use of terror and that, as the threat of terror receded, Israel must support efforts
to create a viable state. He reiterated his personal commitment to implement the
Road Map, but without setting a timetable.
803.  President Bush said that confronting Iraq showed the US “commitment to effective
international institutions”; and that he wanted the words of the Security Council to have
meaning. The world needed:
“… international bodies with the authority and will to stop the spread of terror
and chemical and biological weapons … High-minded pronouncements against
proliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them
– and use force if necessary … the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill
said, ‘to make sure that the force of right will, in the ultimate issue, be protected
by the right of force’.”
804.  In her memoir, Dr Rice wrote that the speech was made after she and Mr Hadley
had “realized belatedly” in late February “that the President had not made the broader
arguments” for action in Iraq. She also commented: “But the die had been cast. This was
a war that had been justified by an intelligence judgement, not a strategic one.”243
805.  Following the speech, Mr Straw asked for further work on the draft vision for
the Iraqi people, which had first been produced in 2001, on the grounds that a “public
commitment on the lines of the draft could have a powerful impact in Iraq and the region
as well as on the British domestic debate”.244 It would not be launched or trailed until
after the UN had voted on the second resolution because of the risk that it would be
presented as “discounting the role” of the Security Council. Care would also be needed
to avoid confusing the message that the justification for military action rested firmly
on disarmament of WMD.
806.  Mr Straw thought it essential that the UK, US and “other coalition members” were
speaking to a common script. That underlined the importance of making progress with
the US on post-conflict planning; and although there was nothing in the UK draft that
“could not be squared with US policy” as set out in President Bush’s speech, “elements
… go further than the US has so far done in public or, on some issues including
UN involvement, in private”.

807.  A ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ was eventually agreed, and issued
at the Azores Summit on 16 March 2003 (see Section 3.8).

JIC Assessment, 26 February 2003:
‘Iraq: Prospects in the North’
At the request off the FCO the JIC produced an Assessment on 26 February of how
the Iraqi regime would respond in northern Iraq to a Coalition attack; the likely attitudes
and actions of Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds; and the prospects for northern Iraq
post‑Saddam Hussein.245 The Assessment highlighted the short and longer-term risks
of action in northern Iraq.
The JIC specifically asked Mr John Scarlett, the Chairman, to draw the Assessment
to the attention of Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.246 He wrote that it noted:

•	

“The continued presence of significant military forces in the North and the
possibility that they were equipped with WMD.”

•	
•	

“The potential for fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces.”
“The potential for Iranian involvement”.

Mr Blair commented: “I need to talk on this.”247

Cabinet, 27 February 2003
808.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 27 February that:

•	
•	
•	
•	

he would continue to push for a further Security Council resolution;
humanitarian and reconstruction planning needed to take “centre stage”,
and he would pursue that with President Bush in the coming days;
decisions had to be made; and
failure to achieve a second resolution would reinforce the unilateralists
in the US Administration.

809.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had held a meeting with
Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, and Mr Straw, “at which we went over
the distinct possibility of no second resolution because the majority was not there for
it”.248 Mr Blair “knew that meant real problems, but he remained determined on this,
and convinced it was the right course”.
810.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that the draft resolution could be put to the vote in the week

Council, which was likely to be at Foreign Minister level.249 There had been considerable
diplomatic activity to win the votes of the 10 non-permanent members of the Council.
He thought that Spain and Bulgaria would support; and Syria and Germany would vote
against or abstain. Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan were being
encouraged to vote for the resolution. France and Russia would need to “think through
their responsibilities”.
811.  Reporting on his visit to Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, Mr Hoon said that they were
supportive of “our approach”. The Royal Navy Task Force and about half the total British
military commitment of 45,000 service men and women was in the region. He was
“confident that the troops and their equipment would arrive in place as planned”.
812.  Mr Hoon had “one particular concern” which he had discussed with General
Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), that:
“Not enough planning had been done on the post-conflict phase of operations,
including humanitarian relief. British forces could find themselves in charge of
a portion of Iraq quite quickly if resistance to Coalition military action collapsed.
It would be helpful if experts from the Department for International Development
could work with military planners in the region and consider pre-positioning
humanitarian supplies so that there was no hiatus in the event that military action
took place.”
813.  Ms Short said that experts had been involved in talks in the Pentagon.
Preparations were “just beginning and needed to be expedited”. A UN legal mandate
was “essential” for the humanitarian and reconstruction tasks that lay ahead. Without
that, “proper preparation was impossible”. That matter “needed to become a priority
for the Coalition”. It would be “difficult” to accommodate action in Iraq within her
department’s contingency reserve: “Greater resources were likely to be needed.”
814.  The points made in discussion included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

249 

The MEPP needed to be revived quickly. That was the focus of much Arab
frustration.
Unity inside Europe needed to be restored “as soon as possible after
any military action”.
Keeping to the UN route and winning support for a new Security Council
resolution would garner support in the UK.
In the event of a veto, gaining a preponderance of votes for a new resolution
could still be important.
Insufficient credit had been given to the value of the No-Fly Zones and the
difference between life in northern Iraq, which was beyond Saddam Hussein’s
direct control, and that elsewhere in Iraq.

Cabinet Conclusions, 27 February 2003.

•	

There had been “sharp differences of view” in the debate in Parliament
on 26 February, the tone was not “unpleasant, but the issues were difficult,
and views could still be swayed”. The commitment to a further debate had
been “wise”.

815.  Mr Blair said that he would continue to push for a further Security Council
resolution. President Bush’s commitments the previous day in respect of the MEPP were
“helpful”. Looking beyond the current divisions in the international community it would
be “important to seek unity of purpose through the humanitarian and reconstruction
work which would follow any military action”. Planning in this field “needed to take centre
stage”. He would pursue that with President Bush “in the coming days”. The “transitional
civil administration in Iraq should have a United Nations mandate, although the scale
of United Nations involvement should balance the administrative effectiveness with
the necessity for proper authority”.
816.  Mr Blair described the debate in the UK and Parliament as “open”:
“Feelings were running high and the concerns expressed were genuine. But
decisions had to be made. The central arguments remained the threat posed
by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Iraq; the brutal nature of the Iraqi
regime; and the importance of maintaining the authority of the UN in the international
order. Failure to achieve a further Security Council resolution would reinforce the
hand of the unilateralists in the American Administration.”
817.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“At Cabinet, things were pretty much rock solid … I could sense a few of them only
fully realising … the enormity of the decisions, the enormity of the responsibility
involved. Robin [Cook] was the trickiest … Clare [Short] was doing her usual …
and for her was relatively onside. She wanted to do a big number on aftermath
preparations but TB was there ahead of her. He was very calm, matter of fact, just
went through where we were on all the main aspects of this. Margaret Beckett
[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] … made a very strong
intervention. She was a really useful barometer and she was very supportive.
Nobody was really looking to make TB’s position more difficult … with the possible
exception of Robin.”250
818.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair had:
“… said later that he felt only now was [President] Bush really aware of the full extent
of the stakes here. This had the potential to transform for good America’s relations
with Europe and the rest of the world, and in a worst-case scenario was a disaster

for everyone. He wanted to get the thing done quickly, but he also wanted them
to understand better the broader agenda. He felt Bush had moved a good deal
on that but was less convinced it permeated through the rest of the Administration.”
LORD GOLDSMITH’S MEETING WITH NO.10 OFFICIALS, 27 FEBRUARY 2003
819.  When Lord Goldsmith met No.10 officials on 27 February he advised that
the safest legal course would be to secure a further Security Council resolution.
820.  Lord Goldsmith told them, however, that he had reached the view that
a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 was capable of reviving
the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a further resolution,
if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take
the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.
821.  Lord Goldsmith advised that, to avoid undermining the case for reliance
on resolution 1441, it would be important to avoid giving any impression that the
UK believed a second resolution was legally required.
822.  At the request of No.10, Lord Goldsmith met Mr Powell, Baroness Morgan
(Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations) and Sir David Manning
on 27 February.251 The discussion, and Mr Powell’s request that Lord Goldsmith’s advice
should not “become public”, are addressed in Section 5.

Discussions at the UN, 27 and 28 February 2003
823.  Informal consultations in the Security Council on 27 February showed there
was little support for the UK/US/Spanish draft resolution.
824.  The Security Council held “informal consultations” on the UK/US/Spanish proposal
on 27 February.252
825.  Mr Miller provided a brief for Sir Jeremy Greenstock to use in the Council
discussion, setting out the UK assessment of Iraq’s WMD and its response to resolution
1441.253 That is addressed in Section 4.3.
826.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported:

•	

Ambassador Negroponte had said he “hoped for a decision on the resolution
in the not too distant future”; and that it “asked only if Iraq had complied with
its final opportunity”. “The Council should judge the facts on the basis of what
had happened over the last 108 days.” He would be “concerned” about the

message to Iraq “if the Council were not able to pass this straightforward
justified resolution”.
Mr Lavrov had said implementation of 1441 and 1284 should continue “until
the inspectors encountered impediments and obstacles”. Iraq was “not blocking
the work of [the] inspectors and was more and more actively co-operating
on substance”. That was “the result” of “continuing pressure” from a “unified”
Council “and the strong inspection mandate which could, if necessary, be
made more effective”. Facts were needed “to close this issue”. He suggested
distribution of UNMOVIC’s “clusters” document to provide the basis
for discussion.
Mr Aguilar Zinser, Mexican Permanent representative to the UN, said Mexico
“still wanted: disarmament; a peaceful solution; inspections … and multilateral
consideration of this issue” and, unusually, asked the UK, US and Spain a series
of questions about the proposal.
Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN “urged
the P5 to find a solution”. He “did not reject the use of force but it must only
be once all peaceful means had been exhausted”. He “wanted the continuation
of inspections for some time before a definitive report”.
Mr Inocencio Arias, Spanish Permanent Representative to the UN, had
said the draft was “one more step in imposing serious diplomatic pressure”.
Saddam Hussein co-operated only under pressure. The more time was given,
“the less pressure he would face”.254

827.  Sir Jeremy reported that the points he had made included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

We were not getting Iraqi co-operation because “the ‘zero’ Iraq had declared
was a lie”.
Iraq was “trickling out concessions to divide the Council, buy time and avert
military action while continuing concealment”.
It was “very probable that Iraq would decide to destroy the Al Samoud missiles.
In addition they might also start trickling out what they claimed to be newly
discovered documents and announce ‘private’ interviews which would in reality
still be monitored and taped.”
He “recognised” that he was “saying things that could not be confirmed by the
inspectors”, but the UK had “invested in facilities not available to other member
states or the inspectors because our national interest was at stake and the UN
was being defied. We were providing detailed intelligence to the inspectors”.
It was “our word against Saddam’s – but Council members had to choose whom
they believed”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

828.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had used “the points provided by the Assessments
Staff”, including Iraq’s:
“… capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons; its delivery mechanisms;
the efforts the regime had taken to conceal WMD; the fact that the regime had
considered whether to declare some weapons but concluded it was too risky; plans
to obstruct … [the inspectors] if they got too close; and the intimidation to prevent
private interviews which Iraq saw as the weak link that could expose their WMD”.
829.  In addition, he stated that “UNMOVIC had been tagging proscribed equipment
that had been repaired by the Iraqis”.
830.  Directly challenging the French/German/Russian proposal, Sir Jeremy reported
that he had said it “wrongly claimed inspections were not being hindered” and “wrongly
suggested” a number of other proposals to strengthen inspections and allow more
time. It “did not add up to a solution delivering disarmament, but at best temporary
containment while Iraq continued to exploit major holes in sanctions to develop WMD”.
831.  Addressing the legal arguments “using the lines agreed with London”, Sir Jeremy
said that the “new draft, if adopted, would confirm the authorisation of the use of force
inherent in resolutions 678, 687 and 1441”. It would increase the pressure on Iraq; but it:
“… did not necessarily mean that its adoption would in practice lead to immediate
use of force. There was still a chance that at the last minute Iraq would take
radical action to disarm. The UK hoped that would be the result. This was the only
remaining route to secure disarmament and a peaceful outcome.”
832.  Sir Jeremy stated that he “recognised that [resolution] 1441 set an awkwardly high
standard. But we had adopted it and at no point had inspectors reported the immediate,
active and unconditional co-operation demanded”. He “accepted delay was more
comfortable and that there were downsides to the action … proposed”. But colleagues
should read the relevant provisions of resolution 687 (1991). Iraq “continued to
cheat the UN”.
833.  Mr Jean-Marc de La Sablière, French Permanent Representative to the UN,
had responded that Sir Jeremy’s statement showed that the resolution “was not about
increased pressure but about force”. He questioned whether the Council “would be
strengthened by supporting a war against which so many objected”. He set out the
French/German/Russian proposal “in standard terms”. There was “no reason to resort
to force in the current circumstances nor to discuss a resolution to legitimise it”.
834.  Mr Wang Yingfan, Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN, said that
“the road of peaceful inspections had not run its course”.
835.  Dr Gunter Pleuger, German Permanent Representative to the UN, said “the
resolution was about war”. The goal was “peaceful disarmament – if we went to war
we would have failed”.

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

836.  Sir Jeremy commented that: “Positions remain generally unchanged” but the
co‑sponsors had produced a “more effective line of argument than the opposition”.
837.  Following the meeting, details emerged of a letter from Iraq to Dr Blix confirming
“agreement ‘in principle’ to the destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles”. Sir Jeremy reported
that he had “tried to discount it in advance with the Council”. If Iraq’s “acceptance ‘in
principle’” did not turn into concrete destruction before 1 March, which Sir Jeremy
thought “unlikely”, that would be “a bonus”.
838.  Dr Blix told the UK Mission that he could and would make the “clusters”
document available for the Council meeting on 7 March. But preparation of the
work programme and key remaining tasks would not be ready by then.
839.  Dr Blix lunched with EU Heads of Mission in New York on 28 February.255
840.  The UK Mission reported that Dr Blix had made a number of points including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	

255 

Iraq “had not actively co-operated until recently”. It was now producing
documents, a list of participants in destruction activities in 1991, and digging
up R-400 bombs. But Iraq had not started to disarm, the picture on interviews
was “disappointing”, and the flow of documents was “limited”.
He shared the US view that it “was for Iraq to declare its WMD holdings and
show how it was disarming”. UNMOVIC was not a detective agency. There was
plenty Iraq could do to address allegations which were well known to Baghdad,
such as checkpoints for trucks and an inventory of underground facilities.
Iraq could have acted earlier. Iraq was not co-operating fully and actively.
Full co-operation should not take a long time. If UNMOVIC secured full
co‑operation, “verification would take neither years nor weeks but months”.
There had been no change of heart, just more activity. Iraq had attempted
to conceal things.
The debate was “somewhat over-focused on the outstanding questions identified
by UNSCOM”. It was not possible to prove a negative (Iraq’s claim that it had not
resumed any WMD programmes): “But Iraq could certainly make the negative
plausible (e.g. producing documents; opening underground facilities).” It could
“certainly do more on interviews”.
He thought there was increasing acceptance in the Council that he should
circulate UNMOVIC’s clusters of unresolved questions. But UNMOVIC should
not “grade” Iraq’s co-operation; that was “the responsibility of the Council”.
But producing the document would facilitate Iraq’s task.
He did not think he was bound to deliver the work programme required
by resolution 1284 “only on 27 March”. It would be “fairly short”, but the
Commissioners had still to take a view.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

It would “make sense for UNMOVIC to identify some priorities” within the
clusters. He suggested VX, anthrax and SCUD missiles.
“… just three months of inspections was ‘not fully satisfactory’ as a decent
amount of time to give the inspections effort. But that was a Council decision.”
If the Council voted for war, there would be a long term monitoring requirement.
It would be for the Council to decide whether UNMOVIC should go back and
on what terms.

841.  Dr Blix subsequently told the UK Mission that he could and would make the
clusters document available for the Security Council meeting on 7 March. But
preparation of the work programme and key remaining tasks would not be ready by then.
842.  The UK Mission also reported that Ambassador James Cunningham, US Deputy
Permanent Representative to the UN, had:

•	
•	

said he was “not opposed to surfacing the clusters document … provided it was
not accompanied by the list of key remaining tasks”; and
agreed that, “after any conflict, US forces should certainly be accompanied
by UNMOVIC inspectors to witness the uncovering of WMD and missiles.
But there was Pentagon resistance … and, if the resolution failed to pass,
giving UNMOVIC a role could be a difficult argument.”

843.  The UK continued to provide information to UNMOVIC on potential targets for
inspection but, by late February, it was “less confident about these than some of the
previous targets”.256

UNMOVIC report, 28 February 2003
UNMOVIC issued its quarterly report to the Security Council on 28 February.257
The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York reported that UNMOVIC had
concluded that Iraq had been helpful on process but there was no explicit conclusion
on substance.258
Other points included:

•	

The “clusters” document could serve as an important source for the selection of
key remaining tasks.

•	

Verified disarmament would be “problematic” without co-operation and even with
co-operation it would take some time.

•	

Results in terms of disarmament had been very limited so far.

•	

Iraq could have made a greater effort in the period and it was hard to understand
why some measures which might achieve results had not been taken earlier.

•	

It was only after mid-January that Iraq took a number of steps that had the
potential to result in the presentation of either proscribed items or of relevant
evidence.

The report was discussed in the Security Council on 7 March.

UK attempts to secure support for the draft resolution
844.  In meetings in Madrid on 27 and 28 February, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar discussed
the need for a second resolution and the positions of other members of the Security
Council, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Mr Aznar’s concerns following his meeting with President Bush that the US
might be over-confident.
Doubt that France would actually veto a resolution although it was attempting
to prevent nine positive votes.
The need for the US to “win” the Mexican vote given its “history of
non‑intervention … strong anti-US nationalism, and [President] Fox’s lack
of a majority in Congress”.
President Lagos’ understanding “that military action would go ahead”, his view
that “it would be better for it to do so in the UN context”, his wish not to have the
“decisive vote”, and the need “to find something to help Mexico and Chile”.
Pressure from, for example, Brazil for a common Mexican/Chilean position.
The outcome of the visit to Africa by Baroness Amos, FCO Parliamentary Under
Secretary of State.
Hopes that Pakistan could be persuaded to vote in favour of the resolution.
Uncertainty about President Putin’s position.
That it was “unlikely that the Arab idea of exile for Saddam would work,
but it was worth a try”.259

845.  Mr Blair focused on:

•	
•	
•	

259 

the importance of keeping close to Dr Blix, who “must not be taken
in by the likely Iraqi destruction of the Al Samoud missiles”;
the UK’s assessment of Iraq’s concealment of its WMD;
the need to focus on the “1999 left-overs” and interviews;

Letter Rycroft to McDonald, 28 February 2003, ‘UK/Spanish Summit, Madrid, 27-28 February: Iraq’.

the need to show “as quickly as possible that military action had brought the
Iraqi people a humanitarian benefit”; and
the need to press the US that the UN “had to be centrally involved, legitimising
the international presence”.

846.  To address the difficulties created by “the impression that the US was determined
to go to war come what may”, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar agreed the need to pursue a
communications strategy showing that they “were doing everything possible to avoid
war”. Mr Blair would also seek more public support from Denmark and the Netherlands.
847.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“Blix was now causing us significant problems. He was talking now about Saddam’s
line on [potential decommissioning of] Al Samoud missiles being a significant
piece of disarmament. TB was raging again, said the man was supposed to be a
civil servant, but had decided to behave like a politician. He is just desperate not
to be seen as the person who allowed a war to start, but his job is to present the
facts. He felt Blix was being bullied successfully by the French who, he was now
convinced, wanted as their main foreign policy objective to build Europe as a power
rival to the US, and determined to shaft TB …”
“He was also worried that Kofi [Annan] … was getting closer to the Franco‑German
position …”260
848.  At the end of February, a senior official in the US Administration sought
the UK’s views on whether the resolution should be put to a vote or withdrawn
if it was judged that there was insufficient support for its adoption.
849.  No.10 took the view that it would want a vote.
850.  Following his farewell calls in Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer reported
that Mr Richard Haass, the Director of Policy Planning in the State Department, had
produced a memorandum which challenged the conventional wisdom by suggesting that
the second resolution should be withdrawn if it was likely that it would not be adopted;
and that Secretary Powell would be interested in Mr Straw’s views.261
851.  Sir Christopher’s letter was also copied to Sir David Manning, Sir Michael Jay,
and Sir Jeremy Greenstock.
852.  Mr Powell sought Mr Blair’s views, commenting that he had told Mr Haass on
28 February that the UK “would prefer to put the resolution to a vote and that, “having
thought about it”, that was “even more strongly” his view: “Refusing to put this to the
vote and claiming we had nine votes would hole us below the waterline.” In addition,

Mr Powell commented, “how do we know if the French will veto if we don’t put
it to the test”.262
853.  Mr Powell also recorded that Mr Blair was very opposed to the idea.
854.  Sir David Manning commented “Me too”.263
855.  In his memoir, War of Necessity War of Choice, Mr Haass described
a “mini‑debate” within the US Administration:
“… about whether to press for a second resolution despite its poor prospects.
Some … favored doing so as a means of pressurising others to stand up and declare
themselves against going to war, even if it did not appear that we had the votes to
win. I never understood this logic and thought this approach misguided, and instead
argued that the worst of all outcomes would be to lose a vote and then go to war.
This would be widely viewed as … arrogant … and raise even more fundamental
questions concerning the legitimacy and legality of what the US was contemplating.
I also thought it would do real and lasting damage to the United Nations. Far
better to explore getting a second resolution and then pull back if consultations
demonstrated that it was likely that we could not prevail … I argued all this out in
a memorandum that Powell distributed to the [NSC] Principals. Fortunately, this
position carried the day, and the Administration decided to pull back if and when
it became obvious that no international consensus favoring war would emerge.”264
856.  An Arab League Summit on 1 March concluded that the crisis in Iraq must
be resolved by peaceful means and in the framework of international legitimacy.

Arab League Summit, 1 March 2003
An Arab League Summit meeting, held in Sharm al-Sheikh on 1 March, discussed the
“serious developments in the crisis over Iraq”. The communiqué recorded that the Summit
had resolved:

•	

“To reaffirm its absolute rejection of a strike on Iraq … The Iraqi crisis must be
resolved by peaceful means and in the framework of international legitimacy.”

•	

“To demand that the inspection teams should be given enough time to complete
their mission … and to call upon them to continue to observe objectivity …”

•	

“To emphasise the UNSC’s responsibility to ensure that Iraq and its people are
not harmed, and to protect Iraq’s independence and the integrity and unity of
its territories …”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

“To re-affirm that their countries should refrain from taking part in any military
action targeting the security, territorial integrity and unity of Iraq or any other Arab
country.”

•	

“To emphasise solidarity with the Iraqi people … and to stress that it is time to lift
the sanctions imposed …”

•	
•	

“The Kingdom of Bahrain to form a Presidential Committee …”

•	

“To consider the disarmament of WMDs in Iraq an inseparable part of the WMD
disarmament of the region, including Israel …”265

“The affairs of the Arab world and development of its regimes are a thing decided
by the peoples in the region in [a] way that suits their national interests, not by
foreign interference. In this context the leaders denounce reported attempts to
impose changes on the region, interfere in its internal affairs or ignore its interests
and just causes.”

Mr John Sawers, British Ambassador to Egypt, reported that the proceedings had
been broadcast live on Egyptian television and that the statements by Arab leaders
had “displayed a more balanced approach than was evident from the communiqué”.266
Mr Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian President, had said that the best way to solve the
crisis would be for Iraq to comply with international law represented by the UN; and
to co‑operate fully with the inspectors. Mr Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian President,
had said that war was inevitable and the region should focus on the aftermath of war.
Sheikh Zayed, the Emir of Qatar, had tabled a written suggestion that Saddam Hussein
should be given an amnesty and step down.

857.  Sir David Manning and Mr Scarlett visited Mexico and Chile on 1 and
2 March to explain the UK’s position to Presidents Fox and Lagos and to seek
their support.
858.  On 27 February, Mr Gregory Faulkner, British Ambassador to Chile, reported
Chilean concerns that the Permanent Members of the Security Council were not seeking
to resolve their differences on Iraq.267 The Chileans thought that passed the buck for
decision-taking to the non-permanent members, which was unfair. Chile wanted an
amendment to the draft resolution asking the inspectors to produce a conclusive report
within a specific deadline of a week to 10 days. This would also help Mexico.
859.  Sir David Manning was reported to have told President Fox on 1 March that
Mr Blair believed that matters had come to a head, UN credibility was eroding
and containment was not sustainable.268 Iraq must come clean now or face the
consequences. Mr Blair was convinced that Iraq’s WMD had to be dealt with now or we
would face a worse situation later. The Iraqi declaration of 7 December 2002 had been
a disappointment which did not address vital issues such as the whereabouts of anthrax

and VX. Since then, the inspectors had been prevented from doing their job properly.
War must be a last resort but the international community could not allow Saddam
Hussein to play games and spin things out. Proper access to scientists was one key
to progress.
860.  Mr Scarlett was reported to have told President Fox that the UK had developed:
“… a range of sources, some inside Iraq, that had proven reliability. We had built
up a consistent picture in which we had confidence. Our allies, including Europeans,
had no serious differences of substance with us …
“While we believed that UNSCOM had been able to disarticulate Iraq’s nuclear
programme it had not been able to account for a wide range of chemical and
biological materials – we were particularly worried about VX and anthrax. Even
conservative estimates of material Iraq still held indicated the capacity to assemble
thousands of WMD artillery shells. Since 1998 Iraq had continued to produce
new agents, develop its missile capability and, with less success, reconstitute
its nuclear programme.
“In 2002 a conscious decision was taken to deny possession of WMD to frustrate
a renewed and strengthened inspection programme. We had watched a policy
of concealment and intimidation develop. Evidence had been dispersed, factories
cleaned up and scientists cowed.
“… Some UNMOVIC successes in January resulted in further efforts to hide
evidence and deceive inspectors. Continued small successes forced Iraq
to move to a policy of slow, small concessions to give the impression of movement
(eg on missiles). For the UK, the litmus test would be interviews with scientists.
Iraq realised their knowledge was their Achilles heel, hence the intimidation.”
861.  President Fox was reported to have listened carefully and with an open mind.
Mexico wanted to continue to seek consensus. It did not like talk of action “with or
without the UN”; overriding international institutions had grave internal consequences
for countries nurturing fragile newly created institutions. He was attracted to the
Canadian idea of benchmarking Iraqi co-operation.
862.  Sir David Manning had concluded that Mexican support for a second resolution
was “not impossible, but would not be easy and would almost certainly require
some movement”.
863.  In a telephone conversation with Mr Blair on 2 March, before his meeting with
Sir David Manning and Mr Scarlett, President Lagos wondered if there was room for
clarification of what the Security Council was trying to achieve.269 He was worried that
talk of regime change was overshadowing the issue of disarmament in the media.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

He wondered if the Council could set benchmarks and mentioned interviews with
scientists. He understood UNMOVIC had interviewed only seven scientists. “Setting
benchmarks … looked better than going to war over a few missiles.”
864.  President Lagos said that he was calling on other P5 states to assume
responsibility for what was going on. It was not acceptable for them to say: “We’ll
abstain, it’s not our war”. He had told President Chirac that was not good enough; if he
did not agree with the resolution, he should veto rather than shift the responsibility on
to others. President Chirac had sent an emissary to try to win him [Lagos] over, but he
thought it would be possible to work out a compromise in the Security Council “during
the week” and he wanted to talk through the benchmarks idea with Sir David Manning.
865.  Mr Blair recommended that Chile should look again at the 1999 UNSCOM
report which made clear the scale of outstanding material and the extent of Iraqi deceit.
The issues were the “unaccounted for WMD and the need for real co-operation”. The
missiles were “a side issue”. Saddam Hussein “had admitted their existence thinking
they were not in breach of sanctions”, and he “had had little choice but to destroy them
when UNMOVIC decided that they were”.
866.  Mr Blair stated that he:
“… took [President] Lagos’ point about the need to be precise and specific about
what the Security Council wanted. Otherwise people interpreted the destruction of
the missiles as real progress and said that we should leave the inspectors in longer.”
867.  President Lagos agreed. The real issue was CBW not missiles, and that should
be put to the international community. Mr Blair was right that Saddam Hussein was only
co-operating because of the pressure on him, but he wanted the P5 to “participate and
assume their responsibilities”.
868.  President Lagos added that the French political system seemed to be divided
on a veto: “There was an internal discourse … But the French were not producing
alternative ideas, they were just playing for time.” President Chirac had told him that
he was against any deadline at all, not just that suggested by Canada.
869.  Mr Blair stated that he was “in no doubt that Saddam had CBW and was
concealing it”, but he “accepted the need to think about how to present the case”.
870.  In his subsequent meeting with President Lagos, Sir David Manning was reported
to have set out the need to act on Iraq to prevent other potential proliferators; the
importance of the UN delivering after President Bush had been persuaded to go down
the UN route; and Saddam Hussein’s failure to take his opportunity and the continued
pattern of obstruction.270 Sir David “regretted” the split in the Security Council; without it,
Saddam Hussein might have cracked. The UK saw war as a last resort and “needed a

second resolution because of public pressures”; it liked the Canadian idea of a deadline.
Resolution 1441 already contained benchmarks, but they might have to be presented
in a different way. Sir David had also said that, if it came to war, it would have to be
“through the UN and with the UN heavily involved in the aftermath”.
871.  Mr Scarlett was reported to have described the intelligence assessment and,
in response to a specific question, informed President Lagos that “although there were
some differences of detail e.g. over the degree to which Saddam could weaponise,
the French assessment was similar” to the UK’s.
872.  President Lagos repeated his concerns, including the difficulty of securing
nine votes or winning the presentational battle without further clarification of Iraq’s
non-compliance, and his suggestions to identify benchmarks with a short deadline.
Sir David Manning agreed to report the conversation to Mr Blair.
873.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that, during February, “despite his best
endeavours”, divisions in the Security Council had grown not reduced; and that
the “dynamics of disagreement” was producing new alliances. France, Germany
and Russia were moving to create an alternative pole of power and influence.
874.  Mr Blair thought that was “highly damaging” but “inevitable”: “They felt
as strongly as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw it.”
875.  Mr Blair concluded that for moral and strategic reasons the UK should be
with the US.
876.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had called him on 1 March “for a chat re Blix”:
“A combination of Blix and the recent moves by the Iraqis had got us on the back foot
again.” Mr Blair:
“… felt it was all now about the politics of the UNSC, and would come down to a
hard-headed argument for votes. It was all going to ebb and flow but we just had
to keep going. He was clear that the consequences of not being with the US now
were incalculable.
“I said I felt there had been various points where we could have done something
different vis-a-vis the US. He said no, the only way to have had influence with them
was to be clear from the start that we would be with them when things got really
tough. He was clear that our interests were aligned.”271
877.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that, “politically, as well as to put the issue beyond
any legal claim to the contrary, a second resolution was certainly desirable”.272 During

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

February 2003, “despite his best endeavours”, divisions in the international community
had grown not reduced:
“The ten new accession countries [in the EU] came out strongly for the US
position … Spain and Italy both supported action. Allies of the US outside Europe
such as Japan and South Korea also rallied. So did many of the applicant countries
for NATO. Australia gave unstinting and determined support.
“But public opinion in many traditionally supportive countries, like Turkey was
strongly anti. Canada decided they couldn’t support without a new resolution,
as did Mexico …
“Basically, there were nations for whom the American alliance was a fundamental
part of their foreign policy. They tended to back the US. Then there were those
for whom the alliance was important, but not fundamental. They backed off …
the dynamics of disagreement then started to fashion new alliances, with France,
Germany and Russia, in particular, moving to create an alternative pole of power
and influence.”
878.  Mr Blair added:
“I thought this was highly damaging; but I also understood it was inevitable. They
felt as strongly as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw
it. They thought conflict would harm relations between the West and Islam, and of
course the more they said this, the more they rather played into that analysis and
strengthened it.
“… I agreed with the basic US analysis of Saddam as a threat; I thought he was a
monster; and to break the US partnership in such circumstances, when America’s
key allies were all rallying round, would in my view, then (and now) have done major
long-term damage to that relationship.
“I had one last throw of the dice. The problem which sensible opinion had with it
all was the feeling that it was a rush to war … the US position was that this was
all very well but … they couldn’t simply wait until a diplomatic dance, which they
had fair evidence for thinking would be interminable, was played out. Their position
was: resolution 1441 was a final chance; if he didn’t take it; if we give him time, we
just allow him to mess us around as he has before; he won’t reform; we’re kidding
ourselves if we think he will; so let’s go and get the job done.
“The inspectors’ reports were at best inconclusive, but they certainly weren’t
evidence of ‘immediate, unconditional and active compliance’. The US was
champing at the bit. President Bush was actually losing support by waiting. The
international community was split. The party was split. I was between numerous
rocks and hard places.

“The strain on everyone around me was almost unbearable …
“Gradually I did deal with it. I sat and reasoned it all through. I knew in the final
analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally and strategically.
But we should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First to make
the moral case for removing Saddam … Second, to try one more time to reunite
the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of a
continuing breach.”
879.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had telephoned him at 7:45am on 3 March
and was:
“… even more worried than he had been on Friday. He felt things were just not
where they needed to be. David M[anning] and John Scarlett came back from their
weekend trip … both countries were very firmly on the fence and could see no
reason to come off it. TB said it was still possible we could get a majority on the
UNSC but if it was in circumstances where people felt we bullied and arm-twisted,
the French would be less worried about putting down a veto. The Americans were
frankly alienating people by their tactics. David M said the message these smaller
countries got was the basic assumption from the Americans that they would come
over in the end.
“I said … that our problem on the communications front was largely caused
by US friendly fire … They looked the whole time like they were desperate for
war. We at least didn’t look like we were desperate for war, but we did look like
we were desperate to be with them … TB said he would have to tell Bush that it
was not possible to get the votes at the moment. It was totally what they didn’t
want to hear but they had to hear it from someone. He was very down on the
Americans … I sensed they were becoming irritated with us …”273
880.  Mr Campbell added that the destruction of missiles had “tipped the balance”
of public opinion “towards giving the inspectors more time”. Mr Blair was “moving
to the Canadian position of a bit more time to get the questions finally answered”.
881.  Mr Straw proposed an offer of safety and immunity if Saddam Hussein would
go into exile and returned to the earlier idea of setting out publicly some key
benchmarks against which Iraq’s “full and active” compliance could be judged.
882.  Mr Straw spoke twice to Secretary Powell on 2 March to discuss progress
in securing support for the UK/US/Spanish draft resolution and possible ideas
for addressing the concerns that had been raised by other members of the
Security Council.274

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

883.  In a discussion on the position of Russia, Secretary Powell said that Mr Ivanov had
stated that there was nothing in it for Russia to vote for the second resolution. It meant
an end to inspections and Iraq’s neighbours were not threatened by Saddam Hussein.
884.  In the context of remarks reported to have been made during a visit to China,
Secretary Powell had asked Mr Ivanov if Russia would veto the second resolution.
Mr Ivanov had responded, “You know me better than that”; he had simply been
explaining that, under the UN Charter, Russia had the right of veto but he had avoided
getting drawn into whether it would be used. Secretary Powell would be urging President
Bush to speak to President Putin.
885.  Mr Straw reported that he had told Secretary Powell that the level of support in
the UK for military action without a second resolution was palpably “very low”. In that
circumstance, even if a majority in the Security Council had voted for the resolution with
only France exercising its veto, he was “increasingly pessimistic about whether we could
carry the Party” to support military action.
886.  Mr Straw added that the debate in the UK was:
“… significantly defined by the tone of the debate in Washington and particularly
remarks made by the President and others to the right of him, which suggested that
the US would go to war whatever and was not bothered about a second resolution
one way or another.”
887.  Mr Straw had proposed consideration of additional language in the second
resolution “pledging immunity to Saddam and entourage if he were to leave Iraq by a
specific date”. Secretary Powell had declined, commenting that he did not think Saddam
Hussein would agree.
888.  Mr Straw sought Mr Blair’s agreement to adding an ultimatum to the draft
resolution.275
889.  Mr Straw wrote: “Things may be moving towards a majority but I will not believe
it until it happens”, There were concerns that the draft resolution looked like a “fait
accompli” and a “blank cheque for war”. Key potential allies “needed a better reason” for
supporting the resolution.
890.  Mr Straw’s view was that the language in the resolution on performance targets
and deadlines would not be acceptable “to either US or UK for obvious reasons”, but he
had “two thoughts”:

•	
•	
275 

an offer, subject to legal advice, of safety and immunity if Saddam Hussein
would go into exile; and
returning to the earlier idea of setting out publicly some key benchmarks against
which Iraq’s “full and active” compliance could be judged.

Minute Straw to Prime Minister, 3 March 2003, ‘Iraq: Second Resolution’.

340

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

891.  Mr Straw thought that an ultimatum had “significant” advantages: “It would indicate
that we still wanted a peaceful outcome to the crisis; help get the moderate Arabs on
board; help our friends on the Security Council; and put France especially on the spot.”
It might make France “think twice about a veto”; “they knew as well as we did that he
[Saddam Hussein] was only likely to take it [the final opportunity offered in resolution
1441] when he knew for certain there was no other way out”.
892.  Mr Straw suggested that the “clusters” document could be turned to the UK’s
advantage by “setting out a few carefully selected tests” and pointing to the document for
further amplification. There was a risk that Saddam Hussein might produce “thousands
of pages of commentary” and the UK would need to keep the emphasis on the need for
“compelling evidence that he was now committed to full and active compliance”.
893.  Mr Straw advised that, to “be credible with the middle ground”, his proposals
would need “another week or two” to “convince some of the crucial swing voters”.
In his view, that might “be possible without disrupting the military plan”.
894.  On 3 March, Mr Blair proposed an approach focused on setting a deadline
of 17 March for Iraq to disclose evidence relating to the destruction of prohibited
items and interviews; and an amnesty if Saddam Hussein left by 21 March.
895.  In a conversation with Mr Jan Peter Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister,
Mr Blair commented that “Saddam was still playing around”; and that he was “struck by
the parallels with 1997-98”.276 The “situation would be clearer by the middle of the week”;
the UK was “working flat out to get the votes in the Security Council”. Mr Blair stated
that “a majority in the Security Council with a French veto would be almost as good
as a SCR”. He hoped the French were carefully considering the implications of a veto.
“Unless Saddam co-operated in full, the inspectors would never find all the WMD:
the history of UNSCOM showed a pattern of Iraqi concealment and deceit.”
896.  In a conversation with Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister,
Mr Blair stated that “the ‘middle group’ in the Security Council was moving in the right
direction. We needed to focus on the facts that Saddam had still not accounted for the
WMD identified by UNSCOM up to 1998 and no real interviews of scientists had taken
place.”277
897.  Mr Blair also told Mr Rasmussen that he thought the timing “would move pretty
quickly – days rather than weeks” after Dr Blix’s report on 7 March; and that the
Americans would take action if there was no further resolution.
898.  Mr Rycroft sought Mr Blair’s agreement to a strategy to secure the Chilean vote,
adding that if that was obtained, “we will probably also get the Mexicans”. President

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Lagos was “In particular … looking for a little more time and a report from Blix judging
Saddam’s compliance against specific benchmarks”.
899.  Mr Rycroft suggested that the three main elements of a strategy could be:

•	

•	

•	

“A slight change to the draft resolution.” We could add in explicit references
to the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei, concluding that they confirmed
either that Saddam Hussein had “failed to comply with, and co-operate fully in
the implementation” of resolution 1441, or that Iraq had “failed to take the final
opportunity” afforded by the resolution.
“Benchmarks.” Making public “in the next day or so what is required of
Saddam in one or more key areas”. The benchmarks would not be set out in the
resolution but the date of the vote would provide a deadline for compliance. That
would allow Chile to say that “as there is not full compliance”, it would vote for
the resolution.
“Offer of exile/amnesty to Saddam.” Making “clear publicly again that we are
not intent on war come what may, and that we are determined to explore every
last avenue for peace. This includes making clear that we support Arab attempts
to get Saddam to leave Iraq and go into exile in exchange for an amnesty.”278

900.  Mr Blair produced a handwritten note on 3 March setting out a list of potential
actions, including;

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	
278 
279 

Setting Saddam Hussein a deadline of 17 March for disclosure of documentation
and proof of destruction.
Presenting the “20 best” scientists for interview outside Iraq, with their families
identified and their safety guaranteed.
If Saddam Hussein failed, giving him until 21 March to leave Iraq with
an agreed amnesty.
A declaration “by the nine/ten [non-permanent members of the Security Council]”
endorsed by Canada.
A “launch” following Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 7 March in Chile
or Mexico.
“… trying to persuade Russia”.
Agreeing a:
{{ UN

role in post-conflict Iraq;

{{ broad-based

government; and

{{ humanitarian

effort.

Making “a last plea to France not to veto but to help”.
Publishing an “analysis of Saddam’s deception alongside the … declaration”.279

901.  A typed version of Mr Blair’s note, with Mr Rycroft’s comments, is published with
this report.280
902.  A separate minute from Mr Rycroft, stating “You asked for a plan we could
work up with the Mexicans and Chileans, as a way of bringing them to vote for the
second resolution”, elaborated on the suggestion of identifying benchmarks to define
“full co‑operation”, making clear that judgements were for the Security Council;
and that Dr Blix’s reports “would form an important basis for the facts underpinning
the judgements”.281
903.  Mr Rycroft added that that differed from previous work on benchmarks because
it was “us” not Dr Blix “putting forward the benchmarks and answering the questions
on Iraqi compliance”.
904.  The minute set out the key demands in resolution 1441 and a note listing
benchmarks on biological weapons, chemical weapons, missiles, documentation
and personnel. On tactics and timing, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair:

•	
•	

“we face an uphill struggle securing US agreement to any further time”.

•	

The UK “must avoid at all costs a further Council decision after our
second resolution”.

•	
•	

The judgements on Iraqi performance “must not” be tied to Dr Blix’s report
to the Security Council on 7 March, and the UK should not “seek or encourage
a further Blix report after 7 March”.

The UK “could be vague publicly about when we would judge Iraqi behaviour”.
The UK “would have to make clear privately to the US that we were talking about
making those judgements at some point next week or at the latest early in the
week of 17 March”.

905.  Mr Rycroft also wrote:

•	
•	
•	

Sir David Manning had not seen the proposals.

•	

The UK needed to make clear that “full, positive answers to all of the questions”
would be needed to demonstrate full co-operation – “destruction of a handful
of Al Samouds is a small part of the picture”.

•	

280 
281 

Mr Straw wanted to talk to Mr Blair “as soon as possible”.
The FCO opposed benchmarks on the grounds that Saddam Hussein would fulfil
a few of them.

Sir Jeremy Greenstock should advise on the tactics: “His advice so far is that
we should not respond to the Chilean concerns until after 7 March, because
it may be unnecessary if by then the Chileans intend to vote for our resolution
and because it would cause a split with the US …”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

906.  Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair:
“… was concerned that, having shifted world (and British) public opinion over the
months, it had now been seriously set back in recent days. We were not in the right
position. The Prime Minister was considering a number of ideas which he might well
put to the President.”282
907.  Mr Straw recorded that Secretary Powell had advised that if Mr Blair wanted
to make proposals, he should do so quickly.
908.  Mr Straw also recorded that the US was not enthusiastic about the inclusion of
an immunity clause for Saddam Hussein in the resolution. He had told Secretary Powell
that Mr Blair had thought that “might be seen as premature”; and that “if necessary”
it might be done “at the appropriate time in a separate resolution”.
909.  Mr Straw reported that he and Secretary Powell had discussed the problems
in the UK. Secretary Powell had told President Bush that he judged a vetoed resolution
would no longer be possible for the UK. Mr Straw said that he had been told that, without
a second resolution, only 100 Conservative MPs would vote with the Government.
In those circumstances, approval for military action would be “beyond reach”.
910.  In the context of a discussion about the lack of real serious US planning for
post‑conflict, the number of troops that might be required to secure the ground behind
the US advance to Baghdad, and the role envisaged for the UN, Mr Straw recorded
that he had told Secretary Powell that, “whilst the US Administration had to be the best
judge of its long term interests”, he “thought that it would reap a whirlwind if it failed
to secure legitimacy for what it was doing in respect of Iraq. We were not there yet.”
911.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix continued to see attractions
in the Canadian proposal but was talking about a deadline of 1 May or 1 June.
912.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s report of discussions in New York on 3 March, included:

•	

Discussion with the US delegation about:
{{ US

thinking that a French veto would not severely undercut the legitimacy
of military action and Ambassador Negroponte’s “guess” that France was
“talking up the veto to deter us from putting the resolution to a vote”.

{{ Setting

•	

282 

Iraq a deadline for Iraq to be “unconditionally disarmed” by 17 or
21 March with the UK suggesting a variant setting a deadline by which Iraq
would have “failed to take its final opportunity”.

In response to a suggestion from Sir Jeremy Greenstock that it might make
more sense for UNMOVIC temporarily to withdraw before any vote on a
resolution, Dr Blix said he would discuss that with Mr Annan, but “he would
not want to be accused of playing to a minority in the Council”.

Dr Blix would circulate the “clusters” document to the Security Council
on 7 March, but the work programme would not be ready.
Dr Blix was concerned that while it was possible to establish material balances
up to 1998, it was less clear how Iraq’s flat denial of any activity since then
should be treated.
Iraq was being “hyper-active”; there has been some private interviews over
the previous weekend, one of which – on UAVs – had been “informative”.
In response to UK questions reflecting concerns that interviews would still
be monitored, Dr Blix said that interviewees had not been searched and
“there could of course be bugs in the room”.
Dr Blix saw attractions in the Canadian proposal, which would help to unite
the Council around key tests, which were becoming evident from the “clusters”
document, and a deadline; and had mentioned possible deadlines of 1 May
or 1 June.
The UK had argued that the risk was that “we would simply end up back
at square one a couple of months hence”.
In a separate E10 discussion of the Canadian proposal, Germany had declared
it could not countenance an ultimatum and others “had not seemed particularly
interested, perhaps as it brought the Council back to the same place in the end”.
The majority of the E10 were more concerned about US statements the previous
weekend that the aim of US action was regime change.283

913.  In separate advice “on the end game options”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that
there was little chance of bridging the gap with the French – “senior politicians were
dug in too deep”; and that a French veto appeared “more of a danger than failure to get
nine votes”.284
914.  Sir Jeremy had told Mr Annan that “the UK would not give up on finding a non-war
route if we possibly could”; and that “the French/German/Russian proposal … merely
diminished the pressure on Saddam”.
915.  Sir Jeremy identified the options as:

•	
•	

283 
284 

“… stay firm … and go with the US military campaign in the second half of
March with the best arguments we can muster … if a second resolution … is
unobtainable, we fall back on 1441 and regret that the UN was not up to it …”;
“… make some small concessions that might just be enough to get, e.g. Chile
and Mexico on board”. The “most obvious step” might be “ultimatum language”
making military action the default if the Council did not agree that Iraq had come
into compliance with resolution 1441;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	

“… try something on benchmarks, probably building on Blix’s cluster document”.
That “would be better done outside the draft resolution” to “avoid diluting 1441
(and avoid placing too much weight on Blix’s shoulders)”;
“… putting forward a second resolution not authorising force”, although it was
clear that Sir Jeremy envisaged there would be an “eventual use of force”;
“… a peaceful introduction of forces into Iraq for the purposes of complete
disarmament”. That would be a “genuine last resort”, which would “cut across
the short-term timetable of the Americans and could only be feasible if there was
a genuine wish to avoid an international bust-up.” As Saddam Hussein would be
unlikely to co-operate, it would be a longer route to military action.

916.  Commenting that the talk of vetoes “may be as much to scare us off as an
indication of genuine voting intentions”, Sir Jeremy concluded:
“We will need to:

•	
•	
•	
•	

remain robust that disarmament must be achieved, that there is very little
time left, and that we are willing to contemplate military action without a
further resolution if necessary;
keep up the lobbying with key swing voters, but also with Russia (… even
if the noises right now are negative), so that France increasingly faces the
prospect of an isolated veto;
work on a sample ultimatum that could be proposed by Chile or Mexico …;
continue to reflect internally on whether we would rather:
{{

force a vote …;

{{

not force a vote …”

917.  Sir Jeremy concluded: “So long as we have enough swing votes, the simplest route
may just be to force our (slightly amended) resolution to a vote, and test the French to
veto or not.”
918.  Mr Ricketts told Mr Straw that he and Sir David Manning had discussed
Sir Jeremy’s telegrams and believed that the “best package” might comprise:

•	
•	
•	
285 

Adding a deadline to the draft resolution requiring “a bit more time”. A US
suggestion “that Iraq should have ‘unconditionally disarmed’ in ten days” would
be “seen as unreasonable”.
A small number of carefully chosen benchmarks “set out separately from the
resolution, ideally by the Chileans and Mexicans … We could then use the
clusters document to illustrate how little compliance there had been across
the board.”
The US to make clear that it “accepted a significant UN role in
post‑conflict Iraq”.285

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

919.  On 4 March, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed progress in securing
support for the resolution, including the desire of some members of the Security Council
for clear evidence of Saddam’s failure to comply to justify a vote for a second resolution
and possible amendments.286 Sir David said that “interviews were a litmus test of
Saddam’s intentions”; UNMOVIC “would be having no difficulties … if Saddam had
nothing to hide”. He also suggested pre-empting the argument that Dr Blix’s “clusters”
document might provide the benchmark needed for full Iraqi disarmament: “Instead
we should emphasise that Blix was producing a list … of all the disarmament tasks that
Saddam had failed to undertake …”
920.  Sir David told Dr Rice that the vote on the resolution should not take place until
“we knew we could get nine votes”.
921.  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee on 4 March that it was “a matter
of fact” that Iraq had been in material breach “for some weeks” and resolution
1441 provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it
was “in further material breach”. He emphasised Iraq’s attempts to conceal its
capabilities and deceive the inspectors.
922.  Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had
been opposed to the suggestion that resolution 1441 should state explicitly that
military action could be taken only if there were a second resolution.
923.  Mr Straw gave evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 4 March.287
924.  In an opening statement setting out the UK Government’s position on Iraq’s failure
to comply with resolution 1441, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein’s tactics had been:
“… to deny the existence of weapons of mass destruction and, if caught out, to
offer the smallest concession possible in order to work for delay … We can expect
more concessions right up to the point at which Saddam Hussein concludes that
the international community has, once again, been lured into doing exactly what
he wants. Then the concessions will stop, and Saddam Hussein will be left in
possession of an arsenal of deadly weapons.”
925.  Mr Straw stated that it was assessed that Iraq had the capability to produce
a range of chemical and biological agents and:
“The Iraqi regime has put up an elaborate screen of concealment based on
intimidation and deception to cover this capability … [W]e know that sensitive
materials and documents have been hidden in the homes of employees and
hidden too in hospitals, farms and other sites. Intelligence also suggests that
WMD‑related items may have been buried and others were being kept on the
move every 12 hours using trucks and trains. Throughout the period of inspection

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Iraq’s security and intelligence agencies have been monitoring UNMOVIC and the
IAEA and plans are available to obstruct them if they come close to WMD itself …
Iraq is particularly concerned about … interviews of scientists and others because if
they were carried out as mandated by [resolution] 1441 they would unquestionably
expose the regime’s deception and its stockpile of weapons … In early December we
know that Saddam Hussein issued instructions that scientists were to be threatened
with serious consequences for themselves and their families if they revealed
any sensitive information to UNMOVIC. They were ordered not to agree to any
interviews taking place outside Iraq … The potential witnesses have been coached
in the answers they have to give. Some of them have been removed from their
homes and places of work and detained to prevent them from being interviewed.”
926.  Mr Straw added:
“… we can expect Iraq will continue trickling out so-called concessions, one at
a time, at the last minute to split the Security Council and buy more time while
continuing an active policy of concealment; to start trickling out ‘newly discovered’
documents as part of a co-ordinated plan to tie down UNMOVIC on what the regime
considers to be expendable parts of its WMD programme. We can also expect Iraq
soon to announce that interviews may take place unaccompanied …”
927.  Mr Straw concluded that it was clear that:
“… Saddam Hussein believes he can once again divide and outwit the international
community through a pretence of co-operation. We cannot afford to send him …
any signal, that he is close to success … He is also hoping that he final opportunity,
which was originally afforded to him 12 years ago and then repeated by 1441, was
not final at all …”
928.  Mr Straw was asked a series of questions by Mr Donald Anderson, the Chairman
of the Committee, about the legality of military action without a second resolution.
929.  Asked about Mr Blair’s “escape clause” and whether the Government “would
not feel bound to await” a second resolution “or to abide by it if it were to be vetoed
unreasonably”, Mr Straw replied:
“The reason why we have drawn a parallel with Kosovo is … it was not possible to
get a direct Security Council resolution and instead the Government and those that
participated in the action had to fall back on previous … resolutions and general
international law … to justify the action that was taken … We are satisfied that we
have sufficient legal authority in 1441 back to the originating resolution 660 [1990] …
to justify military action against Iraq if they are in further material breach.”
930.  Mr Straw added that was “clearly laid down and it was anticipated when we put
1441 together”. The Government would “much prefer” military action, if that proved

348

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

necessary, “to be backed by a second resolution”, but it had had to reserve its options if
such a second resolution did not prove possible. That was what Mr Blair had “spelt out”.
931.  Asked if the Government should proceed without the express authority of the UN,
Mr Straw replied:
“We believe there is express authority … There was a … a very intensive debate
– about whether … 1441 should say explicitly … that military action to enforce
this resolution could only be taken if there were a second resolution. That … was
not acceptable to a majority of members of the Security Council, it was never put
before the … Council. Instead … what the Council has to do … is to consider
the situation …”
932.  Mr Straw told Sir Patrick Cormack (Conservative) that Iraq had “been in material
breach as a matter of fact for some weeks now because they were told they had to
co‑operate immediately, unconditionally and actively”. He added:
“… we are anxious to gain a political consensus, if that can be achieved …
which recognises the state of Iraq’s flagrant violation of its obligations. As far as
… the British Government is concerned, that is a matter of fact; the facts speak
for themselves.”
933.  Mr Straw also stated:
“What we also believe, because we want this crisis resolved peacefully, is that
the only way you are going to get this active, immediate and full co-operation by
Saddam Hussein, even at this late stage, is if he realises fully what the alternative
is … [F]or all the suggestions that it is diplomacy that has brought about what
co‑operation there has been … it has come about … above all, by the fact that
there are now a large number of US and UK troops stationed on Saddam’s doorstep
concentrating his mind.”
934.  Asked by Mr Andrew MacKinlay (Labour) how there was going to be “proper
conscious decision-making” about whether Iraq was complying, Mr Straw replied:
“… we make our judgement on the basis of the best evidence. I have to say it
was on the basis of the best evidence that the international community made its
judgement on 8 November. They had hundreds of pages of reports …”
935.  Mr Straw also told Mr Mackinley that:

•	
•	

“by simply passing …1441” Saddam Hussein “readmitted the inspectors having
said he would not”.
“I have seen nothing at all which says we have to take action immediately
because of military planning necessities. The point we are making … is
that the reason we want immediate compliance is because that is what the

349

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

Security Council said … 110 days … is stretching the meaning of the word
‘immediate’ to breaking point.”
France took “the view that it was possible by continuous diplomacy to secure
Saddam Hussein’s compliance. We take a different view. I think the facts and
history are with us.”

IAEA position on Iraq’s nuclear programme
The FCO advised No.10 on 4 March that the UK Mission in Vienna had confirmed
that the IAEA was on the verge of closing the file on nuclear issues in Iraq, despite
information from the UK that had “still not been followed up”.288 The IAEA had apparently
concluded that:

•	

There was “no significant evidence that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium
from Niger”. The documents the IAEA had seen “that formed the basis of such
an allegation appeared to be forgeries”.

•	

Aluminium tubes, “although imported illegally”, were “not connected with a gas
centrifuge programme”. The Iraqis had “satisfactorily explained the use of the
tubes, and the reasons for their various fine tolerances”. The Iraqis “were no
longer (if ever) in a position to manufacture a gas centrifuge, especially without
foreign assistance”.

•	

There was “no evidence to link the magnets with a covert nuclear programme”;
the IAEA had found the part in the guidance system of a missile.

•	

The IAEA had evidence that a significant amount of the missing 32 tonnes of
HMX (a high explosive used to help trigger nuclear fission), had been used for
commercial purposes, as the Iraqis had claimed”.

The positions of other members of the Security Council
936.  Sir John Holmes advised on 4 March that France was intent on preventing
the US and UK mustering the nine positive votes required for a majority in the
Security Council.
937.  Sir John Holmes confirmed on 4 March that France’s main aim was to “avoid being
put on the spot” by influencing the undecided, preventing the US and UK mustering nine
votes, and keeping alongside the Russians and Chinese; and that there was “nothing
that we can now do to dissuade them from this course”.289 He advised that “nothing the
French say at this stage, even privately, should be taken at face value”.
938.  If the French strategy failed, Sir John advised that “a lone French veto remains
hard to imagine but is by no means out of the question”.

939.  Sir John repeated his advice of 24 February that Mr Blair (and President Bush)
should, “if and when it becomes clear that we have the votes, and that the Russians
and Chinese will not veto”, attempt to dissuade President Chirac.
940.  A subsequent telegram set out the key elements of the French position and the
suggestions for arguments the UK might use.290 They included:

•	

•	
•	
•	

France had repeatedly said that war was the worst of all possible solutions,
but “war had been made more likely by Saddam’s ability to exploit differences
in the international community”. The chances of Saddam Hussein taking the
opportunity to avoid war looked “slim”. A veto would not help and “the only
conceivable way of achieving a peaceful solution now is to increase the pressure
on Saddam by re-establishing the maximum degree of consensus in the UN”.
France had argued that war was a disproportionate response to the threat posed
by Saddam Hussein’s WMD, but the point had been reached where failure to
act firmly caused “disproportionate damage to the credibility of the will of the
international community and to wider efforts to limit the proliferation of WMD”.
If war became inevitable, it would be easier to “limit the destabilising effect
elsewhere in the region, about which France has rightly been concerned,
if military intervention is seen to be taken with the authority of the
international community”.
Weakening UN credibility would make it more difficult “to re-establish the clear
and authoritative UN-backed administration and the rapid transition to a civil
regime in Iraq … and more difficult for Europe to play the role the region and
the world will need at that point”.

941.  Separately, Dr Michael Williams, Mr Straw’s Special Adviser, sent Mr Straw
an analysis of the use of the veto by France.291 He did not think France would veto
on its own; but if it believed Moscow would veto, the second resolution would be lost.
It was “perhaps most likely, if the yes votes creep up to nine and beyond”, that
France would “back down and say it accepts a majority verdict”. But the UK could
not rely on that. Dr Williams advised that a strategy was needed which reminded
France “of the dangers and consequences of its present course of action”; and that
would need Mr Blair’s engagement.
942.  The analysis was sent to Sir David Manning and was seen by Mr Blair.
943.  Sir Roderic Lyne, British Ambassador to Russia, had reported on 27 February
that Russia’s position was hardening and it largely agreed with President Chirac.
President Putin would find it hard to vote in favour of military action without
a “smoking gun” or near-consensus in the Security Council.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

944.  Sir Roderic had reported on 27 February that: “Influenced by Paris and Berlin”,
Russia’s position was hardening and it “largely agreed with” President Chirac. The policy
was “to stay with (and behind) the French and Germans while trying not to antagonise
the Americans”. Russia recognised that US action was “not far off”: “Their preferred
option is to prevent nine positive votes and thus avoid an awkward choice on the veto.”
Russia was “unlikely to be the first to break ranks”, and it seemed “far-fetched” to
conceive of Russia “helping the UK to get the swing votes [in the Security Council]”.292
945.  Sir Roderic wrote:
“In the political class, almost everyone would vote for endless containment rather
than conflict. US arguments for bringing this to a head are not accepted. There
is nervousness about the wider consequences. US policy is seen as potentially
dangerous, and part of a right wing ‘axis-of-evil’ agenda … no-one to the right of the
Communists is arguing that Russia should obstruct the Americans. The prevailing
mood is that Russia should not endorse the war, but should stand to one side …”
946.  President Putin “would find it very hard to justify internally a vote in favour of war,
absent a smoking gun or a Security Council near-consensus”. The Russians did “worry
about the UN’s authority”; but they did not “buy our argument that this obliges them
to support the US regardless”. They would “prefer it if we were forced not to put our
resolution to the vote”.
947.  Sir Roderic concluded:
“The best, and probably the only, chance of getting the Russians onside
without a smoking gun would be for [President] Bush to spell out personally
to [President] Putin that support for the resolution will determine the future
of the US/Russian relationship.”
948.  Mr Ivanov told Mr Straw on 4 March that Russia had failed in an attempt to
persuade Saddam Hussein to leave and it would veto a resolution based on the
draft circulated on 24 February. President Bush had already decided to go to war.
949.  Mr Straw reported that he had told Mr Ivanov that the international
community had no choice but to pay attention to President Bush’s priorities.
950.  During his visit to London on 4 and 5 March, Mr Ivanov informed Mr Straw that
Mr Yevgeny Primakov, the former Russian Prime Minister, had just visited Baghdad in
a failed attempt to persuade Saddam Hussein to leave.293 Russia, and others, would
veto the resolution tabled on 24 February. Mr Ivanov also expressed doubts about
claims that military action in Iraq would be quick.

951.  In response to a comment from Mr Ivanov that President Bush had already decided
to go to war, Mr Straw responded that President Bush “would go to war unless – and the
unless had to be big and happen quickly”.
952.  In a discussion on the draft resolution, Mr Straw stated that the UK had never
taken the position that draft text was “take it or leave it”. He had no problem in principle
with tough benchmarks and a very tight timeline; but if an initial 120 days was followed
by another 120 days, “momentum would dribble away. Saddam Hussein only responded
because of military pressure and that could not be sustained for ever.
953.  Mr Straw proposed additional language for the draft resolution setting a deadline
for a Security Council decision on whether Iraq had “clearly begun the process of full
active disarmament as provided by [resolutions 1441 and 687]”, together with a “private
understanding about the targets Iraq had to reach”. Mr Straw was reported to have said
that he was “very allergic to timelines and public benchmarks” which “could lead to a tick
in the box mentality by Saddam and good opportunities for further game playing”.
954.  In his subsequent discussion with Secretary Powell, Mr Straw said that he had told
Mr Ivanov that he thought war could be avoided if Saddam went into exile and there was
real evidence that Iraq was co-operating in its own disarmament.294
955.  Later in the conversation, in response to a question about why Iraq was being
targeted, Mr Straw had replied that “Iraq was President Bush’s No.1 priority; the
international community had no choice but to pay attention to Bush’s priorities”.
956.  Mr Ivanov told Mr Blair that Russia was looking for concrete demands and
a decision on how much time was needed to resolve the issues.
957.  In his meeting with Mr Ivanov on 5 March, Mr Blair explained that the threat
from terrorist groups and unstable states meant that Iraq must be dealt with firmly.295
The issue was whether Iraq was co-operating to the extent required by resolution 1441.
If the UN route did not work on this occasion, the US would not use it for a very long
time. If Saddam Hussein made a genuine change, the inspectors could have as much
time as they liked.
958.  Mr Ivanov had made it clear that Russia was looking for concrete demands and a
decision on how much time was needed to resolve all the issues; and that Russia would
not be able to support any decision that ran counter to its principles.
959.  The record described the meeting as “constructive”, but that “everything
that Ivanov said was consistent with his public threat of the use of a Russian veto
of our current draft”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

960.  Mr Straw agreed after the meeting with Mr Blair that Mr Ivanov could share
Mr Straw’s proposals with Mr de Villepin and Mr Fischer.296
961.  France, Germany and Russia stated on 5 March that they would not let
a resolution pass that authorised the use of force.
962.  Mr de Villepin, Mr Ivanov and Mr Fischer met in Paris on 5 March.
963.  In a press conference after the meeting the Foreign Ministers declared that they
would “not allow a resolution to pass that authorises resorting to force”.297 Russia
and France, “as Permanent Members of the Security Council, will assume all their
responsibilities on this point”.
964.  Sir Christopher Hum, British Ambassador to China, advised on 4 March that
if the resolution was put to a vote that day, China would abstain.
965.  Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence and
Mr Straw’s Special Envoy, met the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Mr Wang Guangya,
and a senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), on 4 March.298
966.  The report of the meeting with Mr Wang records that, following a briefing on
the UK’s assessment of Iraq’s non-co-operation and the need for a second resolution,
China’s view was that Iraq must bear the major responsibility for failing to co-operate
fully, but believed inspections should be given more time. Although it might take longer
to resolve the issue by peaceful means, the time taken would be worth it. There was
a common desire amongst the international community to avoid war. Unanimity was
important for upholding the authority of the UN. China was still studying the draft
resolution. Pressing for a vote now would split the Council and harm its authority.
967.  Mr Ehrman had referred to the points emphasised by Mr Blair in his speech to
Parliament on 25 February. He told Mr Wang that Saddam Hussein’s behaviour since
the middle of 2002, when he had directed the implementation of a concealment policy,
had been “instructive”; and Saddam’s aim was to buy time. Mr Ehrman described
key elements of the concealment policy and stated that much of the evidence in the
UK’s September 2002 dossier “had been supported or confirmed subsequently by
UNMOVIC (for example the range of the Al Samoud 2 rockets)”. Despite Iraq’s efforts,
the UN inspectors had found a number of undeclared items and “Iraq itself had ‘found’
four empty chemical warheads and one aerial bomb containing biological agent”. Iraq
was particularly concerned about interviews with scientists because “if carried out as
mandated they would expose Iraq’s WMD programme” and had obstructed the process.
The UK “judged it unlikely that Saddam would leave” and “faced with military defeat,

Saddam would be prepared to use CBW”. Saddam “had not taken the final opportunity
afforded to him by … 1441”.
968.  Mr Ehrman set out the UK difficulties with the tripartite French/German/Russian
proposal and stated that the UK/US/Spanish resolution “would increase pressure on
Iraq”. There was still a chance for Iraq to take radical action to disarm and the resolution
“was the only remaining route to peaceful disarmament”.
969.  In the separate meeting with a senior MFA official, Mr Ehrman had repeated
the briefing and emphasised the importance of preserving international order and
international law. The UK had made great efforts in persuading the US that it should
use the UN route; that “should not now be lost”.299
970.  Mr Hum advised that China had “appreciated” the UK’s willingness to share its
assessments; but that “if a vote occurred today, I have little doubt they would abstain”.
971.  Baroness Amos advised on 4 March that Angola, Cameroon and Guinea were
not yet ready to commit to a “yes vote” and had emphasised the need for P5 unity.
972.  Following a visit for discussions with the Presidents of Angola, Cameroon and
Guinea, Baroness Amos reported to Mr Straw that:
“… our approach to the visits was right with a focus on our strong relationship with
Africa … our desire to work with each of the countries in partnership and to share
intelligence information available to us about the situation in Iraq …
“All three listened carefully to our arguments, in particular the need to keep the
UN in control of events, to keep the US engaged in multilateral fora and that the
harassment and intimidation faced by the weapons inspectors made a nonsense
of a longer inspection regime.”300
973.  Baroness Amos wrote: “I think we won the argument”; and that:
“… it might be possible to secure the votes. But – as expected – none of the three
were prepared to commit themselves explicitly to a yes vote … They would all much
prefer to abstain than have to choose between us and the US on the one hand
and France and Africa on the other. I was struck by the same argument from all
three, the importance of unity amongst the P5 … and the need for a majority in the
Security Council …”
974.  Baroness Amos cautioned that the UK and US would need to stay in close
touch to ensure that lobbying was complementary and to avoid being perceived to be
harassing the African members of the Security Council. In addition, “some of what is

appearing in the press about ‘inducements’ to secure votes only makes it harder for the
Africans to come on board”.
975.  The report was sent to Sir Michael Jay, Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Richard
Dearlove. It was also widely circulated within No.10.
976.  Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair: “An effective visit, but the three votes are not
yet in the bag.”

The UK position, 5 and 6 March 2003
977.  Mr Blair was informed on the evening of 4 March that US military planners
were looking at 12 March as the possible start date for the military campaign;
and that Mr Hoon was concerned about the “apparent disconnect” with activity
in the UN.
978.  Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary informed Sir David Manning on the evening of
4 March that Adm Boyce had reported indications of growing pressure from US military
commanders, for force posture and other reasons, to take early military action: and that
12 March had emerged as a possible start date for the military campaign.301
979.  Mr Hoon was “concerned by the apparent disconnect between US military
planning and continuing diplomatic activity in the UN” and thought that Sir David “might
wish to ensure that Condi Rice is alive to the continuing need to keep the diplomatic and
military tracks aligned”.
980.  Sir Kevin Tebbit, the MOD Permanent Under Secretary, wrote to Sir Andrew
Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, on 5 March about the need for an agreed legal basis
for military action.302 That is addressed in Section 5.
981.  In Prime Minister’s Questions on 5 March, Mr Blair expressed confidence
in the prospects for securing a second resolution.
982.  In response to a question from Ms Lynne Jones (Labour) asking whether nine
affirmative votes would provide “clear” legal authority “for war”, Mr Blair responded that
the Government would “always act in accordance with international law” and that “we
are confident of securing the votes for that resolution and we will carry on working for
that end”. He added:
“… I know that we both agree the authority of the UN is important. If that authority
is to be upheld, it is important that what we said last November is implemented.
If it is not, the effect on the UN … would be disastrous.”303

983.  Asked by Mr Andrew Selous (Conservative) about the direct threat and risks to the
UK, Mr Blair replied:
“… I think that the threat of leaving Saddam Hussein armed with weapons of mass
destruction is two fold. First, it is that he begins another conflict in his region, into
which Britain … would inevitably be sucked … Alternatively – and I think this is a
powerful and developing threat that the world must face – the risk is that states
such as Iraq, which are proliferating these chemical and biological weapons of mass
destruction, will combine in a way that is devastating for the world with terrorists who
are desperate to get their hands on those weapons to wreak maximum destruction.
“… If we do not stand firm over Iraq now, we will never be able to deal with the next
threat that encompasses us.”304
984.  In the entry in his diary for 5 March, Mr Cook wrote that PMQs “was notable for the
confidence” Mr Blair had “expressed about getting a second resolution”.305 He added:
“I don’t know whether this is calculated bravado to keep Saddam wary, or whether
he is in a state of denial about the mounting evidence that they can’t get a second
resolution on the present terms.”
985.  Mr Cook told Mr Blair that he would be unable to carry public opinion if
he sidelined the inspectors; if Dr Blix needed months, he should be given until
the autumn.
986.  In a meeting in the House of Commons shortly after PMQs, Mr Cook told Mr Blair
that he had “gone out on a limb” and he should “stop climbing further”.306 The UK had
“to be seen on the side” of Dr Blix. Mr Blair would “never carry British opinion” if the UK
was “seen to be sidelining the work of the inspectors”.
987.  Mr Cook also wrote that when Mr Blair had told him that Britain might propose a
new deadline on 7 March, he had said it had to be “seen logically to arise from what Blix
said. If he needed months, we should be prepared to give him until the autumn.” Mr Blair
had replied that he could not deliver that, adding:
“Left to himself, Bush would have gone to war in January. No, not January,
September.”
988.  Mr Cook subsequently wrote that the conversation “was an honest exchange
between two colleagues who were both open about the gulf widening between them”:
and that Mr Blair had “always [been] candid about his intention to be with Bush when
the war began”. Mr Cook had been “deeply troubled” by “two distinct elements” of that
conversation. First, that “the timetable for war was plainly not driven by the progress

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

of the UN weapons inspections”. Mr Blair had “made no attempt to pretend” that what
Dr Blix might report “would make any difference to the countdown to invasion”. In his
speech in Glasgow on 15 February, Mr Blair had said that he wanted to “solve the
issue” through the UN: “Today he was telling me that the solution was not going to
be disarmament through the UN, but regime change through war.”
989.  Secondly, Mr Blair “did not try to argue” Mr Cook out of the view that “Saddam
did not have any real weapons of mass destruction that were designed for strategic
use against city populations and capable of being delivered with reliability over
long distances”.
990.  Mr Straw told Mr Blair that the Labour Party would not support action
beginning the following week.
991.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that Mr Straw had:
“… come over after PMQs. He was genuinely alarmed and worried about the
political fallout. ‘If you go next Wednesday with Bush and without a second
resolution, the only regime change that will be happening is in this room.’ He said it
as a friend and colleague, and he meant it.”307
992.  In his memoir, Mr Straw gave a similar account of that discussion, explaining that
his warning “was not about what I would do. I’d support him. But I felt … we would not
muster the numbers when it came to the vote in the Commons.”308
993.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed developments on 5 March.
994.  Mr Blair proposed amending the draft resolution by adding a deadline
for a decision by the Security Council.
995.  On 5 March, Sir David Manning agreed with Dr Rice that Mr Blair and President
Bush should speak later that day to discuss possible amendments to the resolution,
including the question of a deadline, and to review the lobbying campaign.309 Sir David
told Dr Rice that Chile and Mexico would need “something on timing, and meeting
their need for some sort of benchmarking”. His preference was to focus on the issue
of interviews. Sir David suggested welcoming Dr Blix’s “clusters” document on 7 March
as “graphic proof” of Saddam Hussein’s failure to disarm over the last 12 years.
996.  Sir David also said that the UK was looking at ways of trying to discount
Dr ElBaradei’s decision to close the nuclear file by asking detailed questions.

997.  Sir David advised Mr Blair that he should suggest a “package deal” to
President Bush.310 That should include a deadline in an amended resolution, which
would “probably have to give us an extra week to ten days”, and an “accompanying
declaration (either written or oral)” to meet the Chilean and Mexican need for
benchmarks and calling on Saddam Hussein to go into exile if he were unwilling to
co‑operate with the UN.
998.  Sir David said he had told Dr Rice that Mr Blair might travel to Chile and Mexico
to show we were taking account of their concerns. That might be followed by a “carefully
orchestrated” meeting with President Bush to demonstrate his (President Bush’s)
willingness to listen to partners and allies and that he was still, “even at the eleventh
hour”, hoping that Saddam Hussein would disarm. Mr Blair and President Bush might
then consult President Putin. Even if that did not persuade President Putin to support
the resolution, it might ensure a Russian abstention rather than a veto, leaving President
Chirac isolated.
999.  Sir David said he had made it very clear to Dr Rice that the proposals were his
idea and that they had not yet been agreed by Mr Blair.
1000.  Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that the key points he should make to President Bush
were:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The second resolution was “absolutely vital”.

•	

Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan were “moving in the
right direction”; but they were “not in the bag yet”. Mexico and Chile were
“interested in more time, a deadline, and benchmarks”.

•	
•	
•	
•	

The UK needed “at least nine positive votes and no Russian veto”.
“If the French veto alone, it would be just about manageable.”
The UK thought Russia intended to veto, but “would be moved” by
President Bush.

Adding an ultimatum into the resolution the UK which identified a “set date
(e.g. 17 or 21 March)” for Iraqi compliance.
It was: “Important that it would take a positive decision by the Security Council to
decide that Iraq had taken the required step – so we have the initiative and lock
on the process.”
The need to “define some benchmarks to show what we mean by full
co‑operation”.
The “clusters” document provided “ample evidence on non-co-operation” and
“must” be used to extract benchmarks on BW, CW and missiles.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	
•	

We should “add our own benchmark on interviews … immediate access to
a large number of key people”. That was “where Saddam is really vulnerable”
and “could change overnight”.
A “little more time” would be required and there could be a need for further
meetings and discussions.
It was: “Crucial to have [a] UN role post-conflict.”
The importance of progress on MEPP.311

1001.  Mr Blair spoke to President Bush proposing a further amendment to the
draft resolution.312
1002.  Mr Blair said that an ultimatum should include a deadline of 10 days from the date
of the resolution for the Security Council to decide that “Unless … Iraq is complying by [313],
then Iraq is in material breach”.
1003.  Mr Blair stated that if there were nine votes but a French veto, he thought that
“politically and legally” UK participation in military action would be acceptable. “But if
we did not get nine votes, such participation might be legal”, but he would face major
obstacles. It would be “touch and go”.
1004.  Mr Blair and President Bush also briefly discussed the military plan.
1005.  Mr Campbell wrote that he had only heard Mr Blair’s side of the call “saying
we had a real problem with world opinion, that these countries need a reason to come
round, that he wanted to go to Chile and set out the outlines of an amended resolution
with a deadline”.314 Mr Blair had also told President Bush that he “needed to work
more on Putin”.
1006.  The record of the discussion broadly confirms Mr Campbell’s account.315
1007.  Mr Campbell also wrote that Dr Blix “was out again today, as much commentator
as civil servant”.316 Mr Blair “felt the UNSC had to take control of this now, not Blix”.
Mr Powell had reported that the US and UK “seemed far apart” but Mr Blair “said it was
not as bad as that” he had told President Bush “we would be with them come what
may” but it was “other countries” who “needed help to come over”. The US had “claimed
they had already slowed down as a result of TB, that Bush had wanted to go as early
as yesterday but TB made sure they didn’t. It was a pretty grim scene, and no matter,

1008.  In their subsequent discussion, President Lagos agreed to consider
Mr Blair’s proposals and to discuss them with President Fox.
1009.  Mr Blair spoke to President Lagos on 5 March about rallying international
support and making public opinion understand why he thought Saddam Hussein
was not co‑operating.317
1010.  Mr Blair wanted President Lagos’ view on:
“… setting a deadline for full co-operation, and saying that if the Iraqis did not
co‑operate … they would be in breach. In parallel, we would set out our criteria
for co-operation. This would face Saddam with the decision: co-operate, leave the
scene or face the use of force. It would make clear that force was our last resort.”
1011.  President Lagos agreed to consider the proposal and Mr Blair’s suggestion
of a meeting in Chile, to discuss it with President Fox and others, and to respond
the following day.
1012.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair wanted to go to Moscow and the US as well as
Chile: “We are in this and nobody must think we would ever wobble.”318 Mr Campbell’s
view was that the idea of a visit to Chile “was clearly not on as things stood” and Mr Blair
would need a purpose for a meeting with President Bush.
1013.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair described the purpose of a visit to the US as
“to get them to do the right thing”. Mr Campbell had responded that the US was “already
very clear about their purpose, which was to go for it”. He had also asked Mr Blair “Are
you not sure that your frustration at the way others are dealing with it is just producing a
kind of wanderlust?” Mr Blair had replied that there was no substitute for face-to-face
meetings. Asked if he was sure the issue was really worth “sacrificing everything”,
Mr Blair had replied that it was:
“… always worth doing what you think is the right thing … Iraq is a real problem,
Saddam is a real problem, for us as much as anyone, and it’s been ignored
too long.”
1014.  The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on 5/6 March that the
US was now “firmly on track for military action” and would deal firmly with any
efforts in the UN to slow down the timetable.
1015.  The only event which might significantly affect their timetable would be
problems for the UK and the US was therefore pulling out all the stops at the UN.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1016.  Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported
overnight on 5/6 March that “barring a highly improbable volte face by Saddam”, the US
was “now firmly on track for military action – with or without a second … resolution”; and
that the “only event which might significantly affect their timetable would be problems
for the UK”.319 That had been described as “huge – like trying to play football without the
quarterback”. The US was “therefore pulling out all the stops at the UN”.
1017.  Mr Brenton reported that the US fully understood the importance of the second
resolution for the UK and he had explained the Parliamentary arithmetic. He also
reported that the US had “gained the impression that we need the resolution for legal
reasons” and that he had “explained the real situation”.
1018.  Mr Brenton advised that the US was “reasonably hopeful of getting the nine
votes (although a little disturbed that the Mexicans have not yet come back to them
on our suggested amendment)”. The US was “sanguine” about Russia, and thought
China would not veto “unless, at least, the French and Russians do”. The US could
not “call” France.
1019.  The US would discuss tactics with Mr Straw in New York. The US intention
remained “to go for a vote next week, perhaps with … a very short ultimatum tagged
on”. He had told one of his contacts that “it was not helpful for the US to refer to the
possibility of not going for a vote”.
1020.  Mr Brenton concluded:
“… the military clock is now audibly ticking and only a major shock to our (ie UK)
plans is likely to jolt it substantially. The US can be expected to deal quite firmly with
any efforts in the UN to slow things down.”
1021.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would not countenance the use
of benchmarks. That would delay the military timetable.
1022.  Reporting discussions in New York on 5 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote
that the US would not countenance benchmarks; that “simply risked delaying the
military timetable”.320
1023.  Sir Jeremy and Ambassador Negroponte had agreed on the need to avoid the
risk that Dr Blix would say that Iraq was demonstrating “unconditional, active and full
co-operation”. Sir Jeremy had agreed with Ambassador Negroponte and Mr Arias that
wording was needed “on Iraq demonstrating a genuine change of heart”: “But this had
to be something that could not be played back at us, e.g. in a statement by Saddam
saying he had taken an ‘unconditional and irreversible decision’.” One key test was Iraq
yielding its WMD.

1024.  Discussions between experts on the tactics for the Security Council discussion
on 7 March had agreed the need to pose questions to Dr Blix and that “more material
drawing out key points from the clusters document” was needed:
“We could and should use it to illustrate just how much the Iraq has not done
with respect to inspections. We should also highlight the huge gaps in knowledge
as an illustration that we could not benchmark, nor define key tasks, without
Iraqi co‑operation.”
1025.  Sir Jeremy provided two alternative formulations for the draft resolution
in a separate telegram.321
1026.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw agreed that, in the Security Council meeting
on 7 March, the UK would:

•	
•	
•	
•	

explore additions to the draft resolution;
express outrage over the lack of Iraqi co-operation;
pose tough questions to Dr Blix; and
demand the publication of the UNMOVIC “clusters” document.

1027.  In a meeting on the morning of 6 March, Mr Blair agreed that Mr Straw should
explore additions to the draft resolution, including ultimatum language, exile and the UN
role in post-conflict humanitarian assistance, with Secretary Powell and others in New
York later that day.322
1028.  Mr Rycroft recorded that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Subject to the views of Chile and Mexico, Mr Straw “should stick to our
preference for a period of ten days between the passage of the resolution
and the expiry of the ultimatum”.
Mr Straw should see Dr Blix to “insist that the clusters document is published
on 7 March”.
The UK “should express outrage over the lack of Iraqi co-operation”.
Mr Straw would “put tough questions” to Dr Blix.
Mr Straw would warn Mr Annan “of the consequences for the UN if our draft
resolution is not passed”.
Mr Blair would speak to Presidents Lagos and Putin later that day; and
to President Chirac after the Security Council debate.

1029.  Mr Campbell wrote: “we needed to get out the idea that we wanted the clusters
document out there, also the sense that Blix was just inhaling the politics in all this.
We agreed we needed to publish a version of the clusters document which would help

turn round the arguments.” Mr Straw was to go to New York “with the message from TB
that we needed to turn the clusters document to our advantage”.323
CABINET, 6 MARCH 2003
1030.  Mr Blair told Cabinet that the argument boiled down to the question
of whether Saddam Hussein would ever voluntarily co-operate with the UN
to disarm Iraq.
1031.  Mr Blair concluded that it was for the Security Council to determine whether
Iraq was co-operating fully.
1032.  Mr Blair explained to Cabinet on 6 March that Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei would
be reporting to the Security Council the following day.324
1033.  Dr Blix was proposing to put forward a document which analysed the outstanding
disarmament issues. It was important that the facts should be made public.
1034.  The UK was discussing an amendment to the draft resolution – “to encourage
support from those members who remained undecided” – with some Security Council
members. The support of Mexico and Chile “could be critical to the vote”. It was not clear
what Russia and France would do. The “argument boiled down to whether” Saddam
Hussein “would ever voluntarily co-operate with the United Nations to disarm Iraq.
Members of the Security Council needed to be persuaded on this point.”
1035.  Mr Blair also said that he had agreed with President Bush on the need for the UN
to be “heavily involved” in “the post-conflict situation, in the event that military action was
necessary”. They had also discussed the importance of moving the Middle East Peace
Process forward on the basis of a “Road Map”.
1036.  The points made in discussion included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

the amendment of the draft Security Council resolution should incorporate
a deadline “since the public attached importance to the inspection work”;
the “integrity and dignity” of the UN process was being “diminished” by the
“political arm-twisting” by some members;
reconstruction of Iraq would require a UN mandate, not just their involvement;
otherwise the right of Coalition forces to engage in reconstruction work would
be limited by their status as an occupation force;
the focus on Iraq’s WMD should be maintained, not “diverted to discovery
and destruction of ballistic missiles, albeit the latter could deliver toxic material
in their warheads”; and

the British media operating in Baghdad did not adequately acknowledge the
restrictions under which they were working.

1037.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said it was “the responsibility of the Chief
Inspectors to present the truth about Saddam Hussein’s co-operation with the United
Nations, so that the Security Council could discharge its responsibilities in making the
necessary political decisions”. The UK was “lobbying hard in favour of the draft Security
Council resolution”. It was the duty of Saddam Hussein to co-operate fully, “and it was
for the Security Council to determine whether that had been the case”.
1038.  Mr Cook wrote that Mr Blair had been “surprisingly upbeat about the prospects
of getting the six swing votes on the Security Council” and “even expressed a hope
that Russia might abstain and France might not veto”. That was “not just surprising,
but manifestly unrealistic”.325
1039.  Ms Short wrote that her diary entry for that meeting recorded that she had said
she regretted:
“… we couldn’t use our leverage to get publication of the Road Map. Arm twisting
members of the Security Council looks bad and diminishes the UN. Can’t we let the
Blix process have integrity. Have to have UN mandate for reconstruction, otherwise
occupied territory.”326
1040.  Ms Short added that, in a meeting before Cabinet, Mr Blair had said that he
might need to go to see President Bush again which was the “only way he can get him
[President Bush] to listen”. Ms Short asked Mr Blair to see Mr Annan too.
1041.  Mr Campbell described the meeting as “scratchy”. Both Mr Cook and Ms Short
had been “a bit bolder in setting out their concerns”. Ms Short had said the “idea of
horse trading and bullying was bad for the authority of the UN”. Mr Blair had “hit back
quite hard” saying “it was not just the US who were bullying and intimidating”; France
was making threats too.327
1042.  After Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post-conflict issues
with Mr Brown, Mr Hoon, Ms Short, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean (the joint
FCO/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Minister for Trade and Investment),
Sir Michael Jay and “other officials”.328 That meeting is addressed in Section 6.5.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

USING THE “CLUSTERS” DOCUMENT
1043.  Since 3 March, No.10 and the FCO had been discussing how to use the
UNMOVIC “clusters” document to the UK’s advantage.
1044.  Officials recognised that the document was largely historical and a list
of things Iraq should have done; UNMOVIC was not due to present its analysis
of “Key Disarmament Tasks” required by resolution 1284 to the Security Council
until 27 March. The document was described as a “167 page-long catalogue
of Iraqi intransigence”.
1045.  At No.10’s request, the FCO analysis of the document was sent to all
Cabinet Ministers on 6 March.
1046.  Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair on 4 March:
“Our best guess is that … we have a reasonable chance of securing ten positive
votes … But we are also faced with an increasingly likely French veto.
“To increase the chances of securing nine or ten votes, we should take on board
Chilean/Mexican concerns.”329
1047.  Mr Rycroft identified Chile and Mexico as the least likely of the 10 possible
positive votes. He set out options identified by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, of which “the
most promising” was “a combination of an ultimatum and benchmarks”.
1048.  Setting out a spectrum of options for the language of an ultimatum setting out
actions Iraq would need to have taken “by [17 March]”, Mr Rycroft wrote:
“There are mixed signs as to whether the US would accept any of these approaches.
But our instinct is to press on hard, and to try to persuade the Chileans/Mexicans
themselves to table this amendment, after Blix’s 7 March report.”
1049.  Mr Rycroft added:
“In parallel … but outside the resolution, we should set out what we mean by full
compliance by picking out benchmarks based on Blix’s clusters document … [I]f
we end up with ultimatum language at the soft end of the spectrum, we shall need
to say what we mean [by the language of the resolution] …”
1050.  Mr Rycroft advised:
“There is no guarantee that these moves would help prevent a French veto. But they
should help ensure a Russian abstention and increase France’s isolation. We shall
have to decide, at the last minute, whether the costs of a French veto outweigh the
advantages of a vote showing majority Security Council support. At present, our view

329 

Minute Rycroft to Prime Minister, 4 March 2003, ‘Iraq: A Strategy’.

366

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

is that we must test the French veto threat to destruction and put our resolution to
the vote … Certainly we should give no hint to the French of looking at options short
of putting our text to a vote.
“It is possible that a find by the inspectors would be what it takes to move
[President] Chirac away from a veto. If there were a find (see separate note), it
would be well worth your talking to Chirac to see if it will do the trick.”
1051.  On the timing for a vote, the “preference, shared by the US,” was to seek a vote
“as soon after 7 March as we are confident that we have nine positive votes”. With the
planned ultimatum, there would then be “a week or so before the start of military action
to work on public opinion, rather than attempting to do this before the vote”.
1052.  Mr Rycroft concluded:
“On 7 March, we need to turn Blix’s ‘clusters’ document to our advantage. We need
to stress that it is not exhaustive, yet it still offers a damning indictment of Iraq’s
failure to co-operate. It comprises sections on 29 different weapons/agents … for
each of which Blix includes outstanding questions for Iraq to answer. (I am sending
you the complete list …) At 167 pages, it shows not only what Iraq would have to
do in the future to give full co-operation, but also what Iraq should have done over
the last 12 years. This is further compelling evidence, if any were needed, of Iraq’s
failure to co-operate fully.”
1053.  Responding to a request from Mr Blair for further information on the UNMOVIC
“clusters” document; a minute from Mr Nicholas Cannon, Mr Blair’s Assistant Private
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, described it as “rather historical” and that most of the
information was drawn from UNSCOM’s work.330 The UK had “urged” Dr Blix to “give
appropriate weight to post-1998 unresolved issues”. He had “promised to try”, but
argued that while it was “possible to establish material balances for the earlier period”,
it was “less clear what one could do with the flat Iraqi denial of any activity in the latter
period”; and it was “unclear whether all gaps could be resolved”.
1054.  Mr Cannon reported that France, Germany and Russia had pressed for the
“clusters” document and the UNMOVIC work programme, to be released to the Security
Council. The UK thought that they intended:
“… to distil … a few benchmarks to assess Iraqi compliance. We doubt whether
it would be possible to define ‘key tests’ that did not allow Iraq room to fudge
compliance or Security Council members room for debate about whether Iraq was
meeting the criteria or not. Saddam would be encouraged to continue to dribble out
concessions piecemeal rather than offer a step change on co-operation. So far we
have argued that without full co-operation from Iraq, specific disarmament tasks are
at best irrelevant and at worst allow Saddam off the hook.”
330 

Minute Cannon to Prime Minister, 4 March 2003, ‘Iraq: “Clusters” Document’.

367

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1055.  Addressing two questions, Mr Cannon advised that the document:

•	
•	

Exposed the “scale and range” of Iraq’s WMD and the “long-term pattern of
concealment and deceit”. It flagged up “recent examples of Iraqi deception”.
It could be used as “evidence of Iraq’s failure to co-operate” and its UN
provenance “gave it more credibility than products of potential belligerents”.
Could be used after publication as a quarry for benchmarks, but it “tended
to focus on hardware rather than interviews” and the “sheer number of
outstanding questions” made it possible for the Iraqis reasonably to ask for
more time. Boiling down the list might open the way to suggestions that Iraq
had partially complied.

1056.  Mr Cannon concluded:
“But we can draw on the ‘clusters’ in drawing up our own ‘benchmarks’ … We need
to ensure that on balance it is seen as a list of the things that Iraq should have done,
not a list of things for Iraq to do in the future.”
1057.  FCO analysis of the draft “clusters” document sent to No.10 on 5 March explained
that the document was “intended to form the basis for UNMOVIC’s determination of the
‘Key Disarmament Tasks’”, which the terms of resolution 1284 (1999) stipulated were to
be submitted to the Security Council for discussion by 27 March. A revised draft would
be submitted to the Council on 7 March.331
1058.  The FCO suggested that France, Germany and Russia would “try to use
the document to draw up a ‘leisurely’ timetable for those issues to be addressed”.
The UK position had been that “without full and active Iraqi co-operation, it is not
possible to draw up a comprehensive list of disarmament tasks”; and that: “In any
case, the requirements of resolution 1441 take precedence.”
1059.  The FCO drew attention to a number of points in the draft document, including:

•	
•	
•	

Iraq had “admitted refurbishing some equipment previously destroyed by
UNSCOM, in particular some chemical facilities”.
There had been “a modest expansion of biological industries … UNMOVIC also
acknowledge that there have been a number of intelligence reports concerning
bio-weapon production facilities.”
There had “been ‘a surge of activity’ in missile technology over the past
four years”.

1060.  The FCO commented that the draft document was “not exhaustive” but did
reveal “the enormous amount of Iraqi non-co-operation over the years; a 167 page-long
catalogue of Iraqi intransigence”.

Peter Ricketts, ‘Iraq: Key Papers’.
331 

368

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

1061.  The FCO identified a number of “key points”, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The report was “inevitably not comprehensive”. It was: “Impossible to provide
a comprehensive list of disarmament tasks without Iraqi co-operation and given
the inspectors were out of Iraq for four years.”
A “huge number of questions remain unanswered”. More than 100 specific
actions had been identified which Iraq “must take”. Those were “not difficult,
mostly concerning the need to present documents, evidence and more coherent
accounts of Iraq’s work”. Iraq “could have provided this at any time”.
Iraq could “give no credible account of the surge of activity in the missile
technology field over the last four years”.
Destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles had begun by the UNMOVIC set
deadline of 1 March and 28 had been destroyed by 5 March: “No end-date
has been set for the process.”
There were “uncertainties about Iraq’s use of mobile ‘factories’”.
Iraq’s failure to co-operate over private interviews raised “further suspicions
that Iraq has something to hide”.
UNSCOM had a list of 3,500 names of those it might wish to interview.

1062.  At No.10’s request, the FCO analysis was sent to all Cabinet Ministers
on 6 March.332
1063.  A further analysis of the “clusters” document by Downing Street officials on
6 March picked out the areas which demonstrated Iraqi non-co-operation. As there
was only limited material on ongoing production programmes (other than ballistic
missiles), the two key sets of concerns related to leftover questions from UNSCOM
on chemical and biological weapons, and evidence of a “systematic pattern of deceit
and concealment”.333
1064.  In his discussions with President Lagos on 6 March, Mr Blair stated that
the US would go ahead without the UN if asked to delay military action until April
or May.
1065.  In his discussion with President Lagos on 6 March, Mr Blair was reported to have
stated that:

•	
•	

332 
333 

Saddam Hussein would not make concessions unless he was under pressure.
If the US was asked to delay action until April or May, “they would simply go
ahead without the UN”; we could not expect President Bush to wait after the
end of March.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	

If “Saddam co-operated, war could even now be averted”, but Mr Blair now
“did not think” that Saddam Hussein would co-operate.
He was “prepared to sign up to a statement that war was avoidable if
Saddam co-operated … if Saddam really co-operated he could have more
time to complete disarmament. But the Security Council had to be the judge
of co‑operation”.
He “needed to know whether he had Chilean and Mexican support”.334

1066.  Mr Rycroft reported that President Lagos was opposed to a short deadline and
had decided to wait to see what happened at the Security Council the following day.
ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ’S INTENTIONS, 6 MARCH 2003
1067.  An assessment of Iraq’s intentions on 6 March concluded that the strategy
was to play for time, and Iraq thought that strategy was working.
1068.  The Assessments Staff was confident that Saddam Hussein’s aim would
be the eventual re-creation of his WMD capability.
1069.  Mr Miller provided an assessment of ‘Saddam’s possible next moves’ for
Sir David Manning on 6 March.335 The document was also sent to officials in the
FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet Office.
1070.  Mr Miller described Saddam Hussein’s strategy as “to play for time, gradually
releasing limited information on Iraq’s terms or when there is no other option”.
Iraq thought its strategy was working. Mr Miller stated: “Even if he [Saddam Hussein]
does opt for a declaration of WMD, we are confident that his aim would be the
eventual re-creation of his capability.”
1071.  Mr Miller advised that the decision to destroy the Al Samoud 2 missiles was
“indicative of Saddam’s strategy: a drawn out debate with UNMOVIC over legality; an
offer to form a ‘technical committee’ to review the weapon; compliance; and an attempt
to portray compliance as a major concession”. Mr Miller predicted that Iraq would “draw
out the destruction process”, which might take “as long as two months to complete”.
1072.  Other points made by Mr Miller included:

•	
•	

Iraq was “likely to follow a pattern of a drip feed of information to UNMOVIC”.

•	

It could take two to three weeks to validate any documentation to back up Iraq’s
claims to have destroyed VX.

Passing over documents only in Arabic might be a deliberate tactic to
delay verification.

•	

Progress with interviews continued to be “unsatisfactory”, although there had
been “some improvement”. Iraq was likely to continue attempts to monitor
interviews and to resist interviews outside Iraq.
Iraq was likely to support proposals – for more time for inspections or an agreed
timetable or checklist – put forward by those in the UN reluctant to authorise a
resolution permitting war.

1073.  Mr Miller concluded:
“In short, we have seen no indication that there will be a change in Iraq’s strategy …
Iraq will continue to put the onus on the inspectors to set out what they want rather
than pro-actively provide information … Saddam will be prepared to offer further
concessions – or at least to say he is ready to. But based on current behaviour any
information will be incomplete, will be difficult to interpret and will not represent a
full declaration of Iraq’s capability. On overseas interviews and any proposal for
a substantial UN military force, agreement is likely only in the face of imminent
military action.”
MR STRAW’S MEETINGS IN NEW YORK, 6 MARCH 2003
1074.  In a meeting with Mr Annan, Mr Straw set out the thinking on revising the second
resolution.336
1075.  Mr Straw told Mr Annan that military considerations could not be allowed
“to dictate policy”, but the military build-up “could not be maintained for ever”, and:
“… the more he had looked into the Iraq dossier the more convinced he had become
of the need for action. Reading the clusters document made his hair stand on end.”
1076.  Mr Straw set out the UK thinking on a deadline, stating this was “Iraq’s last
chance”, but the objective was disarmament and, if Saddam Hussein did what was
demanded, “he could stay”. In those circumstances, a “permanent and toughened
inspections regime” would be needed, possibly “picking up some earlier ideas for
an all‑Iraq NFZ [No-Fly Zone]”.
1077.  Other points in the discussion included:

•	
•	

Mr Kieran Prendergast, UN Under Secretary-General for Political Affairs, pointed
out that the UK was “reversing the veto: if there were no positive finding, then
there would be war”.
Mr Ricketts stated that “it had to be this way round if there were to be a
clear deadline”.

It had been decided not to include a provision about exile, but “we were telling
our Arab friends that we had got exile language”.
Mr Prendergast stated that giving Saddam Hussein impunity would cause a “big
public problem: how could we ignore the ICC [International Criminal Court]”.
Mr Straw responded that “if the choice was between war or immunity”, he had
the sense that “people would breathe a sigh of relief”.
If there were to be a conflict, “the UN had a role in humanitarian aid
and reconstruction, and only the UN could give legal authority for any
post‑Saddam government”.
Mr Annan was reported to be “disturbed” by the American position that everyone
had to vote for the resolution “or else the UN would be irrelevant”. The US knew
it needed the UN on a range of issues. The UN was “bigger than Iraq”.
Mr Straw responded that “if we failed the cohesion of the Security Council would
be weakened”.

1078.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Mr Annan had approved.
1079.  In a meeting with Dr Blix on 6 March, Mr Straw had “acknowledged” that the
draft resolution:
“… missed out a necessary intermediate step. We now proposed to offer Saddam an
opportunity to show full compliance accompanied by a slightly longer time frame …
“… [the Government’s] agenda was disarmament and not regime change.
The Prime Minister had told Ivanov that if Saddam gave up his WMD he could
stay. President Bush could not say this publicly, but he too would prefer peaceful
voluntary disarmament to war. If Dr Blix, as the most important witness in the whole
process, reported to the Security Council that Iraq was co-operating then the bunting
would go up in London.”337
1080.  Mr Straw had also “stressed that the underlying intelligence picture which was
agreed by a number of services from several countries was clear – Saddam was not
complying and was misleading the inspectors”.
1081.  Dr Blix told Mr Straw that he would report that the Iraqis had made “some
progress but they still had a long way to go”. Dr Blix “did not personally doubt that the
Iraqis were self sufficient in precursors and had the capability to jump start production
of a range of agents. But the inspectors had found little … although the Iraqis had been
‘hyperactive’ of late in handing over documents and making other gestures, overall
they were not co-operating fully.” Dr Blix had agreed with Mr Straw that “while difficult
to define we would all soon realise what constituted compliance when the Iraqis started
co‑operating fully”.

1082.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Mr Fischer had told Mr Straw that: the
problem was the US agenda of regime change and the timelines created by the military
build-up.338 He could not accept a resolution with language setting an ultimatum plus
a trigger because it would lead directly to war.
AGREEMENT ON A REVISED DRAFT RESOLUTION
1083.  The UK, US and Spain agreed a revised resolution to be tabled in the
Security Council on 7 March.
1084.  Following a telephone call between Mr Straw and Secretary Powell, Sir Jeremy
Greenstock reported that the US was “relaxed about the exact language in the second
resolution; they will agree to what works for us”.339
1085.  The key elements of the draft are set out in the Box below.340

UK/US/Spanish draft resolution, 7 March 2003
The draft resolution recalled the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions
on Iraq and noted that:

•	

the Council had “repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences
as a result of its continued violations of its obligations”; and

•	

Iraq had “submitted a declaration … containing false statements and omissions
and has failed to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of,
that resolution”.

The draft stated that the Council:
“Mindful of its primary responsibility under the Charter … for the maintenance
of international peace and stability;
“Recognising the threat Iraq’s non-compliance with Council resolutions and
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles poses
to international peace and security;
“Determined to secure full compliance with its decisions and to restore international
peace and security in the area;
“Acting under Chapter VII …;
“Reaffirms the need for full implementation of resolution 1441 (2002);
“Calls on Iraq immediately to take the decisions necessary in the interests
of its people and the region;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Decides that Iraq will have failed to take the final opportunity afforded by resolution
1441 (2002) unless, on or before 17 March 2003, the Council concludes that Iraq has
demonstrated full, unconditional, immediate and active co-operation in accordance
with its disarmament obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and previous relevant
resolutions, and is yielding possession to UNMOVIC and the IAEA of all weapons,
weapon delivery and support systems and structures, prohibited by resolution 687
(1991) and all subsequent resolutions, and all information regarding prior destruction
of such items;
“Decides to remain seized of the matter.”

7 March 2003
Security Council, 7 March 2003
DR BLIX’S REPORT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 7 MARCH 2003
1086.  In his report to the Security Council on 7 March, Dr Blix stated that there
had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they
could not be said to constitute immediate co-operation. Nor did they necessarily
cover all areas of relevance; but they were nevertheless welcome.
1087.  As required by resolution 1284 (1999) UNMOVIC was drawing up a work
programme of key disarmament tasks for approval by the Security Council which
would be ready later that month.
1088.  It would take “months” to complete the task.
1089.  Introducing UNMOVIC’s 12th quarterly report of activity to 28 February 2003,
as required by resolution 1284 (1999), which had already been circulated to the
Security Council, Dr Blix stated that, when the report had been finalised, there had still
been “relatively little tangible progress to note” and the report had been “cautious”.
By 7 March, there had been a number of relevant events on which he would bring
the Council up to date.341
1090.  The key points from Dr Blix’s report are set out in the Box below.

Dr Blix’s report, 7 March 2003
Inspections process
Inspections had begun on 27 November 2002, and “faced relatively few difficulties”. Initial
difficulties about helicopters and aerial surveillance had “been overcome”. While there
were “frictions”, “at this juncture”, UNMOVIC was “able to perform professional no-notice

341 

UN Security Council, ‘4714th Meeting Friday 7 March 2003’ (S/PV.4714).

374

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

inspections all over Iraq and to increase aerial surveillance” and its capabilities were
being increased.
Documents and interviews
Iraq, “with a highly developed administrative system”, should have been “able to provide
more documentary evidence”.
It was “a disappointment” that Iraq’s declaration of 7 December 2002 “did not bring new
documentary evidence”. Dr Blix hoped that “efforts … including the appointment of a
governmental commission” would “give significant results”:
“When proscribed items are deemed unaccounted for, it is, above all, credible
accounts that are needed – or the proscribed items, if they exist.”
Where “authentic documents” did not become available, interviews “may be another way
of obtaining evidence”. Iraq’s provision of “many names” had prompted two reflections:
“… with such detailed information existing regarding those who took part in the
unilateral destruction, surely there must also remain records regarding quantities
and other data concerning the various items destroyed.
“… with relevant witnesses available it becomes even more important to be able to
conduct interviews in modes and locations, which will allow us to be confident that
the testimony is given without outside influence.”
Iraq seemed “to have encouraged interviewees not to request the presence of Iraq
officials … or the taping of interviews” but “conditions ensuring the absence of undue
influence were difficult to attain inside Iraq. Interviews outside Iraq might provide such
assurance. It is our intention to request such interviews shortly.”
Thirty-eight individuals had been asked for interviews and 10 had accepted UNMOVIC’s
terms, seven during the last week.
Inspections
Iraq had denied the existence of mobile production units for biological weapons and that
proscribed activities were being conducted underground. Inspections had taken place at
declared and undeclared sites but no evidence of proscribed activities had “so far been
found”. Iraq was “expected to assist in the development of credible ways to conduct
random checks of ground transportation”.
Inspectors were examining Iraq’s programmes for remotely piloted vehicles and data was
being collected to assess the range and other capabilities of the models found.
In relation to “reports of proscribed activity conducted underground”, which Iraq had
denied, Dr Blix stated that “no facilities for chemical or biological production or storage
have been found so far”. Iraq should provide information on any underground facilities that
were suitable for the production or storage of weapons of mass destruction.
Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC would need some more staff to monitor ground
transportation and to inspect underground facilities, but he:
“… would rather have twice the amount of high quality information about sites
to inspect than twice the number of expert inspectors to send.”

375

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Recent developments
Dr Blix stressed the importance of Iraq’s acceptance of the destruction of Al Samoud 2
missiles and associated items, which constituted a “substantial measure of disarmament
… the first since the middle 1990s”.
Other points covered by Dr Blix included:

•	
•	

UNMOVIC was reviewing the legality of the Al Fatah missile.

•	

There was “a significant Iraqi effort under way to clarify a major source of
uncertainty” about the “quantities of biological and chemical weapons” that had
been “unilaterally destroyed in 1991”, by excavating a site that was formerly
“deemed too dangerous”. Eight intact bombs had been unearthed, two of which
had a “liquid fill”. That “should be followed by a serious and credible effort to
determine” how many R-400 bombs had been produced.

•	

Iraq had informed UNMOVIC that there would be further legislation on prohibiting
work on weapons of mass destruction.

Papers on anthrax, VX and missiles had recently been provided. Many re-stated
what Iraq had already declared, but some required further study and discussion.

Dr Blix stated that, in relation to Iraq’s recent initiatives:
“One can hardly avoid the impression that, after a period of somewhat reluctant
co‑operation, there has been an acceleration of initiatives from the Iraqi side since
the end of January. This is welcome, but the value of these measures must be
soberly judged by how many question marks they actually succeed in straightening
out. This is not yet clear.”
Dr Blix stated that the question which was being asked was “whether Iraq has
co‑operated ‘immediately, unconditionally and actively’ with UNMOVIC, as required”
by resolution 1441.
Dr Blix stated: “The answers can be seen from the factual descriptions I have provided.”
He added that, “if more direct answers are desired”:

•	

Iraq had not “persisted” in attaching conditions on the exercise of the
inspectors rights.

•	

The recent Iraqi initiatives to address long-standing issues could be “seen as
active or even proactive”. But “three to four months into the new resolution” they
could not be said “to constitute ‘immediate’ co-operation. Nor do they necessarily
cover all areas of relevance. They are nevertheless welcome, and UNMOVIC
is responding to them in the hope of solving presently unresolved disarmament
issues.”

Key disarmament tasks
Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC was working under several resolutions and that resolution
1284 (1999) instructed “UNMOVIC to ‘address unresolved disarmament issues’ and to
identify ‘key remaining disarmament tasks’ … to be submitted for approval by the Council
in the context of a work programme”. UNMOVIC was required to submit only the work
programme to the Council, and the draft would be ready “this month as required”.

376

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

Dr Blix added that, as he understood “several Council members are interested in the
working document with the complete clusters of disarmament issues, we have declassified
it and are ready to make it available to members of the Council on request”. It provided “a
more up-to-date review of the outstanding issues”; and each cluster ended “with a number
of points indicating what Iraq could do to solve the issue. Hence, Iraq’s co-operation could
be measured against the successful resolution of issues.”

1091.  Dr Blix concluded that “co-operation can and is to be immediate”, but
“disarmament and … verification … cannot be instant”. “Even with a pro-active Iraqi
attitude” it would still take “months” to “verify sites and items, analyse documents,
interview relevant persons and draw conclusions”.
DR ELBARADEI’S REPORT, 7 MARCH 2003
1092.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed
nuclear activities since the inspectors left in December 1998 and the recently
increased level of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security
Council with an assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.
1093.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA was focused on the “central question”
of “whether Iraq has revived, or attempted to revive, its defunct nuclear weapons
programme over the last four years”.342 Dr ElBaradei noted that:
“… in the past three weeks, possibly as a result of ever-increasing pressure by the
international community, Iraq has been forthcoming in its co-operation, particularly
with regard to the conduct of private interviews and in making available evidence
that could contribute to the resolution of matters of IAEA concern.”
1094.  That “should enable” the IAEA “in the very near future to provide the Security
Council with an objective and thorough assessment of Iraq’s nuclear‑related
capabilities”.
1095.  The key points made by Dr ElBaradei are set out in the Box below.

Dr ElBaradei’s report, 7 March 2003
Iraq’s industrial capacity had deteriorated sharply, including through the departure
of foreign support present in the 1980s and large numbers of skilled Iraqi personnel
in the preceding decade.
Interviews were continuing, including two “private interviews in the last 10 days”.
Interviews outside Iraq might be the best way to ensure that interviews were “free”,
and the IAEA intended to request such interviews “shortly”.

UN Security Council, ‘4714th Meeting Friday 7 March 2003’ (S/PV.4714).

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

The primary technical focus of the IAEA in the field had been on the possible resumption
of Iraq’s efforts to enrich uranium. In relation to the three key issues, the IAEA had:

•	

Failed to uncover any evidence that Iraq’s attempts to purchase high strength
aluminium tubes was for “any project other than … rockets”. The documents
provided and interviews had allowed the IAEA “to develop a coherent picture of
attempted purchases and intended usage”.

•	

Verified that none of the magnets Iraq had declared could be used directly for the
magnetic bearings in centrifuges. It was likely that Iraq possessed the expertise to
manufacture such magnets and the IAEA would continue to monitor and inspect
equipment and materials.

•	

Stated that documents relating to the reports of possible acquisition of uranium
from Niger were not authentic, but it would continue to follow up any additional
evidence.

Dr ElBaradei concluded that there was no indication:

•	

“of resumed nuclear activities” in buildings identified as new or reconstructed
since 1998”;

•	
•	
•	

“of nuclear-related prohibited activities at any inspected sites”;

•	

“to date that Iraq imported magnets to use in a centrifuge enrichment programme”.

“that Iraq has attempted to import uranium since 1990”;
“that Iraq has attempted to import aluminium tubes for use in centrifuge
enrichment”;

Dr ElBaradei stated that Iraq’s procurement efforts, including those in relation to magnets
and aluminium tubes, had been conducted “in contravention of the sanctions controls”
imposed by the Security Council. The IAEA would continue to scrutinise and investigate
those issues and hoped “to continue to receive from States actionable information relevant
to our mandate”.

SECURITY COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS, 7 MARCH 2003
1096.  In the discussion, there was unanimity in calls for Iraq to increase
its co‑operation.
1097.  But there was a clear division between the US, UK, Spain and Bulgaria who
spoke in favour of a further resolution, and China, France, Germany and Russia
and most other Member States who spoke in favour of continuing to pursue
disarmament through strengthened inspections.
1098.  The UK, US and Spain circulated a draft resolution deciding that Iraq
would have failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 (2002)
unless the Security Council concluded, on or before 17 March 2003, that Iraq

378

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

had demonstrated full, unconditional, immediate and active co-operation in
accordance with its disarmament obligations and was yielding possession
of all weapons and proscribed material to UNMOVIC and the IAEA.
1099.  Mr Fischer stated that the international community was united in its condemnation
of the Iraqi regime but had different views about how to achieve that “common goal”.343
He added that the briefings from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei made clear that Iraq’s
co‑operation did “not yet fully meet” the UN’s demands. Iraq “could have taken many
of its recent steps earlier and more willingly”, but co-operation had “notably improved”.
That was “a positive development” which made it “all the less comprehensible why that
development should now be abandoned”.
1100.  In line with the French/German/Russian joint memorandum presented to the
Security Council on 24 February, Mr Fischer called for a “tough regime of intensive
inspections” with “a time frame for every single problem”. Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei
should present the Security Council “with a detailed, comprehensive working
programme … without delay”.
1101.  Mr Fischer added that the disarmament of Iraq had to be “pursued energetically
and systematically” and the Iraqi Government had to co-operate fully with the inspectors.
But there was “no need for a second resolution” and the use of force: peaceful means
were “very far from having been exhausted”. Progress in recent days showed that there
were “efficient alternatives to war”. Taking that path would “strengthen the relevance of
the United Nations and the Security Council”.
1102.  Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign
Affairs, reminded the Council of calls by the Non-Aligned Movement, the Arab Summit
and others for the inspectors to be given time to complete their work. Syria was
“confident” that the United Nations, which represented the “will of the international
community”, would opt for peace.
1103.  Mr Derbez expressed concern about the “lack of active, immediate and effective
co-operation” from the Iraqi regime. But Mexico was “greatly distressed” by the erosion
of relationships and common values caused by different visions of how to disarm Iraq
and “worried by the distance” between members of the Council. Mr Derbez called on
members to “avoid taking up inflexible positions”.
1104.  Mr Derbez stated that Mexico:

•	
•	
343 

called on the Iraqi Government “radically [to] change its attitude” to “carry out
immediately clear and unequivocal actions” to demonstrate it had chosen the
path of disarmament;
was “convinced that we have to explore all options and take advantage of all
opportunities to resolve this issue in a peaceful manner”;

UN Security Council, ‘4714th Meeting Friday 7 March 2003’ (S/PV.4714).

379

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

insisted “on the importance of working towards a consensus position” on future
action with respect to Iraq; and
urged members of the Security Council “to work with greater creativity”
on the issue.

1105.  Secretary Powell stated that the Security Council had “one very, very important
question” of intent to address: “Has the Iraqi regime made the fundamental strategic and
political decision to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and to rid
itself of all of its weapons of mass destruction and the infrastructure for the development
of weapons of mass destruction?” It was not a question of “clusters of unanswered
questions” or benchmarks, but of whether Iraq had made the choice actively to
co‑operate. In his view, the presentations by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had been “a
catalogue of non-co-operation”. Iraq’s “initiatives” were only small steps, which had been
“taken only grudgingly; rarely unconditionally; and primarily under the threat of force”.
1106.  Secretary Powell argued that the inspectors should not need more resources to
look for prohibited facilities. That showed Iraq was not co-operating. The Council “must
not allow Iraq to shift the burden of proof onto the inspectors”. Nor could the Council
“return to the failed bargain of resolution 1284 (1999), which offered partial relief for
partial disclosure”. Iraq had to be held to the terms of resolution 1441, which required
“full and immediate compliance”.
1107.  Secretary Powell stated that progress was “often more apparent than real”.
Missiles were being destroyed but Iraq had the infrastructure to make more, which
had not yet been identified and destroyed.
1108.  In the light of events in 1991, when the IAEA had mistakenly been about to
determine Iraq did not have a nuclear programme, Secretary Powell urged caution
in relation to Dr ElBaradei’s report, citing further information calling into question the
conclusion that the aluminium tubes were for unguided rockets.
1109.  Secretary Powell welcomed UNMOVIC’s “compilation of outstanding issues”
which added up to “a damning record of 12 years of lies, deception and failure to
come clean on the part of Iraq”. Iraq had lied to previous inspectors and planted
false evidence. The US view was that those activities were “still ongoing”. In 1998,
when faced with the threat of military action, Iraq had made promises, but had not
delivered. In Secretary Powell’s view, that position had not changed and the UNMOVIC
document revealed:
“… a strategic decision to delay, to deceive, to try to throw us off the trail … to hope
that the will of the international community will be fractured …”
1110.  Secretary Powell stated that the Iraqi regime had not taken the decision to disarm.
The Security Council “must not walk away”. If it failed to meet its responsibilities, “the
credibility of the Council and its ability to deal with all the critical challenges we face will

380

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

suffer”. It was time for the Council to send a “clear message” to Saddam Hussein about
the political will of the Council and its willingness to use force, if necessary, to achieve
the disarmament of Iraq.
1111.  Secretary Powell concluded that the draft resolution for action by the Council
was appropriate, and that it should be put to a vote “in the very near future”. He added:
“The clock continues to tick and the consequences of Saddam Hussein’s continued
refusal to disarm will be very, very real.”
1112.  Mr Ivanov stated that the Council’s “united, energetic efforts” and the pressure on
Iraq “from all sides, including the build up of a military presence” had produced progress
in implementing resolution 1441. There was “a real disarmament process in Iraq for the
first time in many years”.
1113.  Mr Ivanov said that he “agreed in principle” with Dr Blix that if the latest steps
taken by Baghdad had been taken earlier, “the results could be more convincing”.
But they opened the way to resolving outstanding problems. In those circumstances,
Mr Ivanov questioned whether it was “now reasonable to halt inspections” and resort to
force. Russia was “firmly in favour of continuing and strengthening inspection activities
and making them more focused”. The UNMOVIC work programme should include a
list of key disarmament tasks which should be “formulated with utmost clarity” and be
realisable: “That would allow us to evaluate objectively Iraq’s level of co-operation and,
most importantly, to provide an exhaustive answer to all the remaining open questions
regarding banned Iraqi military programmes.”
1114.  Mr Ivanov concluded with a plea that the differences in the Security Council
should not produce a rift, and that:
“Only by acting in solidarity will we effectively face up to new global threats and
challenges. We are certain that the Security Council has to emerge united and
strong from the Iraq crisis, not weakened and divided. Russia will continue to work
towards that goal.”
1115.  Mr de Villepin stated that the inspectors had revealed that Iraq had been actively
co-operating for a month. He asked why, in those circumstances, the Security Council
should engage in a war with Iraq and “smash instruments that have just proved their
effectiveness”. It was “clear to all that in Iraq, we are resolutely moving towards the
complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction programmes”.
1116.  Mr de Villepin argued that the Council should proceed “with information,
verification, destruction”; and Iraq had to provide “further information in a timely fashion”.
Iraq was less of a danger than in 1991. Diplomatic action was bearing fruit and the
American and British presence in the region lent support to the international community’s
collective resolve.

381

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1117.  Mr de Villepin proposed that the pace of inspections should be stepped up on the
basis of:

•	
•	

a hierarchy of key disarmament tasks drawn from UNMOVIC’s work programme;

•	

a schedule for assessing implementation: France was willing to shorten the
time-frame of 120 days set out in resolution 1284 if the inspectors thought that
was feasible.

a progress report from the inspectors every three weeks to maintain the
pressure on the Iraqi authorities; and

1118.  Mr de Villepin stated that the “military agenda must not dictate the calendar
of inspections”. France could not “accept an ultimatum as long as the inspectors are
reporting progress”. He asked whether “by imposing a deadline of a few days”, that
would be “merely seeking a pretext for war”. Some countries might believe that problems
could be solved by force, but not France. It believed that the use of force could “give rise
to resentment and to hatred, and fuel a clash of identities and civilisations – something
that our generation has a prime responsibility to avert”.
1119.  Mr de Villepin stated:
“To those who believe that war would be the quickest way to disarm Iraq, I can reply
that it would create divisions and cause wounds that would be long in the healing …
“… force is certainly not the best way of bringing about democracy. In this case and
in others, it would encourage a dangerous instability.
“… War would only increase it [terrorism], and we could then be faced with a new
wave of violence. Let us beware of playing into the hands of those who want a clash
of civilisations or a clash of religions.”
1120.  Mr de Villepin stated that France understood the “profound sense of insecurity
with which the American people had been living since the tragedy of 11 September
2001”, but there was nothing to indicate a link between the Iraq regime and Al Qaida and
the world would not be a safer place after a military intervention in Iraq.
1121.  Mr de Villepin argued for priority to be given to addressing the crisis in the Middle
East, which represented “our greatest challenge in terms of security and justice”.
1122.  Mr de Villepin concluded that the Council would face a choice of disarming Iraq
through war or peace, and that to make that choice heads of State and Government
should meet.
1123.  Mr Tang stated that resolution 1441 had been “widely welcomed and supported”
because it manifested the determination of the Council to destroy Iraq’s WMD and “truly
reflected the desire of the international community for a political settlement”. There
had been “much progress” on inspections. It was “true” that there were “problems and
difficulties”, but that was “exactly why” it was “necessary to continue the inspections”.

382

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

1124.  China believed that a political settlement could still attain the goal of destroying
Iraq’s WMD. That would “need resolve and determination and, more importantly,
patience and wisdom”. China was “not in favour of a new resolution, particularly
one authorising the use of force”. The power of the Security Council was derived from
all UN member states and it had “no reason to remain indifferent” to the calls for “peace
not war” from the peoples of many countries. The Chinese Government strongly
appealed “to the Council to shoulder its responsibility and to do all it can to avoid war
and to maintain its efforts to achieve a political settlement”.
1125.  Mrs Alvear stated that the reports by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei allowed Chile
“to infer” that Iraq’s co-operation was “inadequate” and the signs of progress in specific
areas did not detract from that conclusion. Chile reaffirmed the need for the “immediate,
full and effective disarmament of Iraq” and reiterated its “urgent appeal to Iraq” to
co‑operate. Chile supported “a solution in keeping with international law and with the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter”, which was the only source of
legitimacy for the Council’s decisions.
1126.  Chile appealed to the five Permanent Members of the Council to find a point of
convergence and “advocated the continuation of rigorous inspections subject to a time
limit”. The use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter could be invoked “only when
all peaceful means of disarming Iraq have been exhausted”. Chile believed a solution
was possible through a “strengthening of inspections … with clear deadlines and
concrete demands”.
1127.  Ms Palacio stated that the Council had “been marking time for 12 years” and
that the Council found itself in the “same situation as in 1991”. Saddam Hussein’s
strategy remained to deceive. She questioned how much time was necessary to take
the strategic decision to collaborate. Saddam Hussein had managed to divide the
international community and to reverse the burden of proof. Only maximum pressure
and the credible threat of force could make an impression on the Iraqi regime. Why
should the international community believe Saddam Hussein’s claims that he had
destroyed all his weapons without being able to detect a “genuine will to disarm”.
1128.  Ms Palacio stated that the Security Council should send clear messages to Iraq
about its determination to achieve complete disarmament and that the Council should
assume its responsibilities to respond. A strategy of more inspectors or more time was
“merely the strategy of impotence”. It was possible to envisage results with respect to
nuclear material and missiles without Iraq’s pro-active collaboration, but that was “not
true for chemical or bacteriological weapons”. Spain wanted a peace that was “safe and
that ensures that those weapons will not be used by Iraq and that they will not fall into
the hands of terrorist groups”.
1129.  In his speech to the Security Council, Mr Straw stated that everyone agreed Iraq
must be fully disarmed and that “Iraq’s failure to co-operate immediately, unconditionally

383

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

and actively with the inspectors” had to be “dealt with”.344 The first question for the
Council was, “has Iraq taken this final opportunity”? His answer was that, as no-one
had said Iraq was “now fully, actively and immediately in compliance”, it had “not so far
taken this final opportunity”.
1130.  Dr Blix’s “clusters” document to the Council was a “chilling” account of Iraq’s
non-compliance over 12 years and there had “not been active co-operation in the areas
which matter”. The examples cited by Mr Straw included:

•	
•	
•	

•	

Iraq had “dragged its feet on as many elements of procedural and substantive
co-operation as possible”.
Iraq was still refusing to pass a law prohibiting State authorities from engaging
on work relating to weapons of mass destruction.
Iraq had “done everything possible to prevent unrestricted, unrecorded
interviews”. Of the 3,500 people on UNSCOM’s lists, “just twelve private
interviews had been allowed”, and “all of those … were threatened and
intimidated beforehand”. He understood that “the scientists most likely to have
the most incriminating evidence have been locked away”. There had been no
interviews outside Iraq. Mr Straw stated: “The restrictions placed on [these]
interviews is itself the most incriminating evidence that Saddam has something
to hide.”
Under-reporting of the import of Al Samoud 2 missile engines and the missile’s
range were examples of Iraq’s “calculation that it can satisfy the Council with
a partial response”.

1131.  Addressing the memorandum produced by France, Germany and Russia,
Mr Straw stated that “it defies experience to believe that continuing inspections
with no firm end date” would achieve complete disarmament “if Iraq’s full and active
co-operation” was not “immediately forthcoming”. The memorandum was “not
even a formula for containment, given Iraq’s proven ability to develop weapons
of mass destruction”.
1132.  Mr Straw welcomed the progress the inspectors had reported. His “earnest wish”,
and that of the UK Government, was to achieve Iraq’s disarmament, “if possible by
peaceful means”. But it was necessary to recognise that “the progress that has been
reported represents only the tip of a very large iceberg of huge unfinished business
required of Iraq”. He also welcomed the diplomatic pressure on Iraq but suggested it
was the presence of US and UK troops in the region which had influenced the recent
increase in Iraq’s co-operation.
1133.  Addressing Mr de Villepin’s statement that “the choice before us was
disarmament by peace or disarmament by war”, Mr Straw pointed out that that was

384

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

“a false choice”. The paradox was that diplomacy had to be backed by a credible threat
of force to achieve Iraq’s disarmament by peaceful means. He wished:
“… we lived in a different world where this was not necessary, but … the choice is
not ours as to how this disarmament takes place – the choice is Saddam Hussein’s
… he can act with astonishing speed when he chooses to … It may take time to
fabricate falsehoods but the truth takes only seconds to tell.”
1134.  In response to Mr de Villepin’s concerns about automaticity, Mr Straw added that
the threat of force or its use had:
“… always been conditional. It would be utterly irresponsible and in defiance of our
solemn duties to the Council for us to walk into a situation where force was used
automatically …”
1135.  In conclusion, Mr Straw stated that the UK remained “committed to exploring
every reasonable option for a peaceful outcome and every prospect of a Council
consensus”. He asked, on behalf of the UK, US and Spain as co-sponsors, for a revised
draft of the second resolution to be circulated.
1136.  In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that he had deliberately picked up Mr de Villepin’s
words and “There was not a word in my speech about the intelligence. It was the
indisputable facts of Saddam’s behaviour that convinced me we had to act.”345
1137.  Mr Georges Chikoti, the Angolan Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that
the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei showed that Iraq’s co-operation was “relatively
insufficient” and called on Iraq to take a more energetic and pro-active role.346 He
suggested that the progress made was associated with specific benchmarks and dates.
That might be a model for strengthening the scope and intrusiveness of inspections.
1138.  Mr Chikoti noted that international community, regional and sub-regional
organisations and international public opinion had been calling for the peaceful
disarmament. Those were “valid and legitimate concerns” but they could not be
“interpreted or transformed into an unwillingness to act”. The responsibilities of the Council
included “exhausting all diplomatic and peaceful means to achieve such disarmament”.
1139.  Mr Belinga-Eboutou stated that Cameroon was pleased to note the momentum
of inspections was “well established”. UNMOVIC’s report from the inspectors showed
real progress but also made clear that the results had “been very limited so far”.
Cameroon did not believe that Iraq had “yet taken the final opportunity afforded by …
resolution 1441”. It was in favour of inspections but they should not go on “indefinitely”.
The Council should “together seek, in good faith, a credible alternative to war and to
endless inspections”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1140.  Mr Belinga-Eboutou identified the “major and central problem” was to “induce
the Iraqi authorities to co-operate actively, fully and unconditionally”. The “gravity of the
situation and the need for effectiveness” required the Council to “harmonise viewpoints
through mutual concessions” to find a solution based on consensus. Council members
should build a common position to make it clear to Iraq that if it wanted peaceful
disarmament it had “no alternative but to abide by the decisions of the international
community”.
1141.  Mr Tafrov stated that Dr Blix’s report was nuanced. Results to date had been
“modest”. Co-operation was “insufficient” and Bulgaria’s view was that Iraq was still
in material breach of resolution 1441.
1142.  Mr Tafrov thought that the tripartite memorandum and the draft resolution
submitted by Spain, the US and the UK were “not incompatible”. Bulgaria agreed with
France, Germany and Russia that the pressure on Iraq must be increased and the draft
resolution was an effective means to do so. Its adoption would be “a logical continuation
of the efforts of the Security Council to make Iraq understand that patience has its
limits”. Bulgaria called for unity of the Council to preserve the credibility of the United
Nations and a means to achieve Iraq’s disarmament, and for an additional effort for
peaceful disarmament.
1143.  Mr Akram stated that, if war was to be avoided, the Council must impress on Iraq
that it must comply “fully and faithfully”. It was “unfortunate” that “divergent approaches”
had emerged within the Council. Pakistan believed that “an agreed approach can
and must be evolved”. He stated: “Once we establish the ways to credibly achieve
the disarmament of Iraq … we can also agree on a relatively short time frame.” That
proposition “would be better than propositions that could result in the early use of force”.
Pakistan did not believe there was an “imminent threat to international peace and
security” and the “cost of delay” would be “much less than the cost of war”. War would
“have grave consequences for the Iraqi people, for peace and stability in our fragile
region, for international security and for a world order based on the principles of the
United Nations Charter and the rule of law”.
1144.  Mr François Lounceny Fall, the President of the Council and the Guinean Foreign
Minister, stated that Guinea “remained convinced” that “while the opportunity for a
peaceful solution still exists”, it could “be seized only if the Iraqi authorities co-operate
sincerely”. Guinea was “in favour of continued inspections” but believed they could not
“go on indefinitely”. A more unified approach from the Council was the “only course” that
could give the Council’s actions “the necessary authority and legitimacy”.
1145.  Mr Aldouri underlined Iraq’s “pledge to continue pro-active co-operation” with
UNMOVIC and the IAEA. He drew attention to the position of France, Germany, Russia
and China who had demanded that the work of the inspectors should continue and that
they should “be given enough time to complete their tasks by peaceful means”.

386

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

1146.  Responding to Secretary Powell’s statement that there was a lack of a strategic
political decision by Iraq to demonstrate its commitment to comply with the UN
resolutions, Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had taken “the strategic decision to rid itself
of weapons of mass destruction” in 1991. He added that:
“All weapons that have been proscribed fall into one of two categories: they have
been either declared or unilaterally destroyed by Iraq. All the declarations that Iraq
has been repeatedly asked to present concerned the details and verification of that
unilateral destruction and nothing … else. It is for the accusers to prove otherwise,
if they possess any evidence.”
1147.  Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had no VX programme.
1148.  Mr Aldouri stated that the issues of concern identified by the US and UK were “an
attempt to confuse the issue” and mask their real agenda to take over Iraq’s oil and the
political and economic domination of the region. Iraq continued to hope for justice from
the Security Council and called on the Council to thwart aggression and prevent “a crime
whose impact would far surpass that of any crime of the past century”. He concluded:
“… war against Iraq will wreak destruction, but it will not unearth any weapons of
mass destruction, for one very simple reason: there are no such weapons, except
in the imagination of some …”
1149.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that questions had been raised about what
would demonstrate that Iraq had taken the strategic decision to disarm. There was
no visible indication of additional votes.
1150.  A “side statement” including benchmarks could be needed to bring Chile
and Mexico on board.
1151.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, during the lunch for Foreign Ministers
hosted by Mr Annan:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Mr Annan had appealed for Council unity and for UN responsibility post-conflict
on humanitarian relief and administrative matters.
Mr Straw had “defended the ultimatum idea and focused it on Iraqi co-operation,
which needed no time at all to signal convincingly”.
Secretary Powell had said the “US would not have come to the UN unless it
believed in collective action” and that the US “would want the UN in Iraq as soon
as circumstances allowed”.
Dr Blix had said that the “months he needed were for verification with a
compliant Iraq … if Saddam could turn out 13,000 pages in a month, he could
manage one and a half pages of a convincing commitment to compliance in a
very short time”.347

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1152.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that “no votes were visibly harvested”. The “body
language” of African members “much improved” over the two days Mr Straw had been in
New York; but:
“We have not yet avoided the benchmarks problem … what would demonstrate
that Iraq had taken the strategic decision to disarm… We could well need a side
statement to bring the Latins on board.”
1153.  The Council was followed by “a long session of informal consultations”.348
1154.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that discussion had centred on three questions
raised by Mr Zinser:

•	
•	
•	

“What did the Security Council have to do to avoid the use of force?”
“What did Saddam Hussein have to do?”
“How long did the Council have to address these issues?”

1155.  The points made by Sir Jeremy included:

•	
•	

The core issue was making “best use of the limited time left”.

•	

The Council “should unite in exerting the heaviest pressure on Iraq so that
Saddam Hussein embarked on the road to peace before the road to war
was authorised”.

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The Security Council “could not, in the light of existing resolutions … set itself
the aim of ‘avoiding war’ … The real question was how the Council could ensure
full implementation of the relevant resolutions (ie complete disarmament without
resort to force.”

“Indefinite delay was an abdication of the Council’s responsibilities. Time would
be needed to reach ‘full and verified disarmament’; but the alternative was not
an open-ended invitation to conduct investigations”.
Saddam Hussein “had to convince the co-sponsors and the Council that he and
his regime had indeed changed their attitude and taken a strategic decision to
disarm voluntarily”.
There was “no real evidence of non-compliance on the nuclear weapons file”.
The “key question” was whether Iraq had WMD: “The UK was sure they did. But
the WMD could not be located because Iraq had hidden them, and they would
not be found without unconditional and immediate Iraqi co-operation.”
The US and UK “had invested time and money in finding out the truth. So
we knew that WMD were being moved every 12 hours; that mobile weapons
facilities existed; and that documents and materials were being moved around.”

•	

The Council “had not made the best use of its time since adoption of [resolution]
1441. In an understandable wish to avoid war, colleagues had perhaps not really
believed the UK/US warnings: but we had taken a decision to put our need for
long term security over our wish to avoid war.”

1156.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had asked Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei a series
of questions:

•	
•	
•	
•	

“How could they be sure the interviewees were not being bugged
or threatened?”
“What real chance was there of UNMOVIC resolving the mobile biological
facilities issues without Iraqi co-operation?”
“Was there any evidence of Iraqi procurement and sites associated with
this programme?”
What was UNMOVIC’s “assessment of Iraq’s declaration in relation to UAVs”?

1157.  Ambassador Cunningham stated that the French and German proposals
assumed Iraqi co-operation, but “it was hard, reading the UNMOVIC cluster document,
to conclude that verifiable disarmament could happen in the near future or was ever
feasible”. Iraq was “behaving now as it had always done”. Subsequently, he stated
that if the Council “spent the next 10 days dreaming about benchmarks it would miss
its final opportunity to secure a peaceful outcome”. The Council “could assist by
bringing maximum pressure to bear”; but since 20 January, “Baghdad had felt under
no pressure”.
1158.  Mr de La Sablière was reported to be “troubled that the Council’s timetable was
being fixed by the US military agenda, and by having to discuss the choice between
war and peace when inspections still offered a real chance of peaceful disarmament”.
The “clusters” document gave the Council an objective basis to address the state of
Iraqi disarmament and: “Only a few questions were left to be addressed: Iraq was
‘largely disarmed’ …” The inspectors “should list the priority issues to be addressed and
the key remaining disarmament tasks”.
1159.  Sir Jeremy reported that:

•	
•	
•	

Spain questioned Mr de La Sablière’s comments and whether the Council was
“really being asked to believe that Saddam Hussein had complied fully with
resolution 1441”.
Russia said it was clear that, to avoid war the Council had to continue
inspections. It also asked whether any of the intelligence received had helped
the inspectors to find anything.
China said the inspections were working and producing results; they should
continue. The draft resolution would “strangle the 1441 system in its infancy”.

389

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Germany stated that it made no sense to break off inspections, especially when
the process was delivering results. The only way forward was for UNMOVIC and
the IAEA to produce objective criteria.
Cameroon stated that the threat of force had been a key element in the progress
so far and military forces could not be left in place indefinitely, but 17 March
might be too soon.
Bulgaria had been ready to support the previous draft and “was studying the
latest proposal positively”.
Syria said there had to be a peaceful resolution of the issue and the inspectors
should produce a specific work programme.
Chile agreed that the Council should work for a consensus; the inspection
process must be allowed to mature; and Iraq must comply immediately. But
he questioned how Saddam Hussein was to be judged. The real question was
“whether the threat posed by Iraq was such that there had to be an end now
to inspections”.
The US responded to Chile that the Council should judge Iraq on the basis
of its experience. Iraqi co-operation over the years was grudging at best.
For the UK, Sir Jeremy Greenstock said that, if Saddam Hussein admitted
he had lied about Iraq’s WMD over the years, “that would go a long way to
convincing us that he had had a real change of heart. If he came forward with
the truth; that would be respected. If he lied, he would be dealt with.”

1160.  In response to the points raised, Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC worked under
resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1441 (2002). The former asked for “a work programme and
key disarmament tasks”. UNMOVIC “did not yet know which of the many issues … were
the key remaining tasks”; it “aimed to submit a list to the Council in the week beginning
19 [sic] March”. The Council had asked UNMOVIC to “complete” the “remaining”
disarmament tasks. Resolution 1441:
“… imposed a greater sense of urgency on the inspection and disarmament process,
but he did not think the Council’s resolutions necessarily led to the conclusion that
UNMOVIC’s activities should cease as soon as next week. The resolutions did not
demand ‘immediate disarmament’ but ‘immediate co-operation’ …”
1161.  Dr Blix was also reported to have stated:

•	
•	

Iraqi co-operation “sometimes seemed grudging”, but “only if UNMOVIC
found that Iraq was concealing things could one say that there was a real lack
of co‑operation”.
With the Al Samoud missiles and UAVs, Iraq was “trying to push to the
boundaries of what was permissible”. On the former, Iraq had arguably
“trespassed over the border”; the resolution did not prohibit UAVs, but they were
“on the border of what was allowed”. UNMOVIC was “still investigating”.

Iraq “seemed to be trying to find ways of assisting UNMOVIC” on mobile
BW facilities.
Walls “might contain eavesdropping devices, but even taking witnesses to
Cyprus might not necessarily guarantee truthful evidence”.
UNMOVIC “could be expected to deal with the key remaining disarmament tasks
in a matter of months”. The timetable proposed in the draft resolution “could not
conceivably allow completion”.
Iraq was “frantic” but “selective” in its co-operation.
A “strategic decision” by Iraq to co-operate would be easily recognised.
“Various intelligence agencies were sure Iraq had retained ‘a jumpstart’ capacity,
but UNMOVIC had seen no hard evidence.”
Not all the evidence the inspectors had been given “was convincing, and some
of it was not even trustworthy”.

1162.  Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA had nearly reached a satisfactory outcome and
two to three more months would lead to a conclusion. The test applied to Iraq had to be
“an objective results oriented one”.
1163.  Sir Jeremy reported that initial reactions to the revised draft resolution had
focused on “the short time offered to Iraq to comply and on the ultimatum”.
1164.  Following a meeting between Mr Straw and Mr Tang, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
reported that China did not want a second resolution “now”; was concerned about the
economic, political and humanitarian consequences of a conflict; and the consequences
for the UN of a public split amongst the P5.349
1165.  Dr Blix recorded that the US and UK had made pre-emptive use of the
“clusters” document before it was formally circulated after the Security Council
meeting on 7 March.
1166.  Dr Blix wrote that although the members of the Security Council knew of the
existence of the draft, they were not aware of its contents before finalised copies of
the text were presented on 7 March.350 The German and Russian Foreign Ministers
had been:
“… keen that it should become public to show that precise requirements could be
placed on Iraq, rather than nebulous demands for a ‘strategic decision’ or a ‘change
of heart’ … neither the US nor the UK was opposed to a declassification of what was
still an internal document. As it turned out, both the US and the UK Foreign Ministers

got copies of the not yet declassified draft, presumably through the American and
British members of our College [of Commissioners].
“The German and French foreign ministers, who had been eager to make use
of the document but did not have such a channel of quick provision … could not
make use of it to show what concrete benchmarks might look like. Their US and
UK colleagues, by contrast, were therefore able to make extensive and preemptive
use of the draft to show how unreliable Iraqi declarations and conduct had been in
the past.”
1167.  Dr Blix added that Mr John Wolf, the US Commissioner, had been critical of the
relevance of the draft “clusters” document, which provided “only a readable historical
account testifying to Iraq’s deception” and had only a few pages on what had happened
after 1998. The US was interested in whether Iraq had taken “a strategic decision”,
and that “was all that mattered”. The US “did not afford the smallest window to the
benchmark approach that Washington saw London working on”. The US “disdain” had
“shocked and surprised the other members of the College”.

Mr Blair’s conversation with President Putin, 7 March 2003
1168.  President Putin told Mr Blair on 7 March that Russia would oppose
military action.
1169.  Following the discussions with Mr Ivanov on 4 and 5 March and the observation
in Mr Brenton’s telegram of 6 March, that the Americans were sanguine about avoiding
a Russian veto, Sir Roderic Lyne wrote to Mr Ricketts on 6 March with advice, including
for Mr Blair’s planned telephone conversation with President Putin.351 The letter was
copied to Sir David Manning.
1170.  Sir Roderic wrote that he was “less sanguine” about avoiding a Russian veto
unless the French position changed. Mr Ivanov’s aim was to help deny nine positive
votes for the resolution and thereby avoid the need to take a definitive decision. He
would have reported to President Putin that the UK was not totally confident of success
and was looking at concessions over language.
1171.  Sir Roderic suggested that when Mr Blair spoke to President Putin, he should
repeat and reinforce the message that he had given to Mr Ivanov, and argue that the
issue was about two fundamental questions of principle:

•	

The need to deal with the problem of proliferation. That was: “big … and …
getting worse … The international community had let this drift … We have to
work together on this. We can’t go around attacking everyone; but if Iraq gets
away with it, it’s open house for everyone … we’ve got to send the message

Minister’s Call to Putin this Evening’.

•	

that the Iraqi threat is over. Dealing with it … will help us stabilise the Middle
East (it’s what moderate Arabs privately want). And, with this behind us, we can
get together to bring the full range of diplomatic pressures to bear on those who
proliferate or support terrorism.”
A multilateral approach to the problem was “hanging in the balance”. Mr Blair
had “persuaded” President Bush to go through the UN because he wanted to
“preserve the Security Council” and wanted “the UN – and all of us, Russia
included – to have a say in what happens thereafter in and around Iraq”.
That was “as much in Russia’s interest as the UK’s”.

1172.  The conversation with President Putin lasted over an hour. Mr Blair emphasised
the importance of working with Russia as a partner and the need to stand firm in
dealing with the threat of terrorism and WMD.352 The record stated that Mr Blair had told
President Putin that resolution 1441 had given Saddam Hussein a final opportunity:
“He had made some concessions with troops on his doorstep, but he was not
co‑operating fully and had no intention of disarming. We must carry out what we
had said we would do to uphold UN authority and avoid unilateral action. So we
would put the second resolution to a vote, with terms to be discussed. We would
have nine or ten votes.”
1173.  During the conversation – and in response to a suggestion that Iraq was currently
co-operating, presented no threat to its close neighbours or to the US or UK, had
nothing to do with fundamentalist terrorists, and that inspections should continue on the
basis of the disarmament tasks based on resolution 1284 (1999) – Mr Blair argued that
the time required was that needed to make a judgement about whether there was full
Iraqi co-operation; and that Dr Blix’s “clusters” document would set out the outstanding
items. In his view:
“In the absence of full co-operation, Iraq was in breach … we must explore every
possibility to resolve the issue peacefully, including through forcing Saddam into
exile. Saddam would only do so if he thought the alternative was force.”
1174.  Mr Rycroft recorded that President Putin thought military action would be a
mistake which Russia would oppose. He commented that President Putin had been:
“… unyielding, but at pains to spell out his reasoning in great detail … On the face
of it, a clear intention to veto. But there may have been just a hint that if negotiations
begin in New York, and engage Moscow, that he will at least be ready to listen.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Lord Goldsmith’s advice, 7 March 2003
1175.  Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Blair on 7 March, recording that he had been asked
for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without another resolution of the
Security Council.353
1176.  That is addressed in Section 5.

Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, 7 March 2003
1177.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush at 1800 on 7 March, he emphasised
the importance of securing nine positive votes in the Security Council for
Parliamentary approval for UK military action.
1178.  Mr Blair argued that while the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was
not sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on
whether Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. If Iraq started to co-operate,
the inspectors could have as much time as they liked.
1179.  Sir David Manning discussed the response to French and Russian tactics to try to
prevent a vote on the draft resolution with Dr Rice on 7 March.354 Sir David told Dr Rice
that the UK “had to have” a vote: that it “had to have one that was understood to be an
ultimatum”; and that it “had to have nine votes”. The UK “could probably manage the
political fall-out if there were a veto, or perhaps even two vetoes”, but the UK “could not
take part in military campaign if they did not reach the nine vote threshold. We would not
be able to get the necessary Parliamentary support.”
1180.  Sir David Manning subsequently told Dr Rice that President Putin was opposed
to the resolution and would reject it. There was also a further discussion of the political
position in the UK: Sir David “repeated at length” the point he had made that morning
and said that “we had to do whatever it took to secure nine votes”. That “might mean
adjusting the wording of the second resolution; it might mean time; or it might mean
some sort of benchmarking”.
1181.  Sir David reported that Dr Rice had assured him that President Bush was
determined to deliver nine votes. Sir David also commented: “But although the
Administration is clearly pulling out all the stops, there is still no sign of willingness
to accept that this may mean extending the time lines.”
1182.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“Condi [Rice] had told David [Manning] overnight that Putin had been clear with
Bush that they would veto a second resolution. Also we still didn’t have a clue as
to whether Chile and Mexico would come over. The mood was gloomier than ever.

TB was keen to get up the clusters document and also move towards the sense
of an ultimatum. He and David were both now expressing their irritation at the US.
David was even of the view that we should be pushing the US to a version of the
Franco-German idea of inspections with force, a blue beret [UN] force involved
on disarmament.”355
1183.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed progress and further
lobbying.356
1184.  Mr Blair emphasised again the importance of securing nine positive votes
for Parliamentary approval for military action.
1185.  Mr Blair stated:
“… there remained a confusion in many minds … about time. If Saddam had
decided to co-operate fully, the inspectors could have as much time as they wanted.
But he had not – no-one believed he was co-operating unconditionally and fully. Ten
days was of course not enough for him to disarm fully, but it was enough to make
a judgement on whether there was a change of heart. In 1441 we had all agreed to
full, immediate and unconditional co-operation, not concessions dribbled out under
the threat of force.”
1186.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had:
“… wanted to give him [President Bush] a clear message about the political realities,
namely that we couldn’t do this without a Commons vote and it was not going to be
easy without a second resolution, or with a resolution that was vetoed. The Russian
veto was a new element … Putin’s position had clearly hardened. During their call
Putin was very clear that he felt taken for granted by the Americans …”357
1187.  Mr Campbell also wrote that President Bush:

•	
•	

was agreeing to a slightly later deadline, 17 March;

•	
•	

“was at least conscious of the difficulties they gave us”; and

had told Mr Blair that he would “certainly go for a vote on the second resolution”,
although he was “still making clear he didn’t feel he needed a UNSCR”;
had said to Mr Blair, “don’t worry, I’ll be more subtle than you fear …”

1188.  Mr Blair had a meeting with Mr Powell, Baroness Morgan, Mr Campbell and
Mr Pat McFadden, Mr Blair’s Deputy Chief of Staff, to discuss the “what-ifs”, including

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

if he lost the vote in the House of Commons.358 Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair “still felt
we were doing the right thing. He said even though we were all rightly irritated by the
Americans, it was the French we should be really angry with.”
1189.  Mr Campbell added:
“We were all outraged at the Blix report. TB said it was political and dishonest …
Scarlett said he was wrong in saying the Iraqis were trying to co-operate more … TB
was very philosophic about it all. As I sat listening to him on the phone, I lost count of
how many times he said: 1. we are right on the issue; 2. we have to see it through;
3, I’m philosophical about what it means for me and whether I survive or not. TB
was keen to push the idea that the only reason the concessions were coming was
because of the pressure we were applying. But there were very real divisions and
dangers and the UN was on dangerous terrain. There was a very clear picture,
clearer than ever, of the US in one place, us in another, the French in another, the
Russians in another, and the UN as an organisation really worried about where it
was heading.”
1190.  Mr Campbell wrote that on 8 March: “Blix didn’t come out as badly as it might
have done. In a sense he was almost irrelevant now.”359 He had agreed with Mr Blair
“the lines to push for the Sundays [Sunday newspapers] – namely there are two routes
by which he can avoid conflict: 1. he disarms, or 2. he goes.” The key was winning the
necessary votes at the UN. Mr Blair “was clear we just had to keep our nerve and keep
striving to get their votes”.
1191.  Mr Cook wrote that Dr Blix’s report was “carefully balanced” and “painfully
honest”, which was not what the US and UK needed: “No.10 desperately wanted Blix
to lay into Saddam and to report no progress, in order that they could mobilise the
Security Council for war.”360
1192.  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Blair drew attention to the passage in Dr Blix’s
report which stated:
“It is obvious that while the numerous initiatives which are now taken by the Iraqi
side with a view to resolving some longstanding, open disarmament issues can
be seen as active or even proactive. These initiatives three or four months into the
new resolution, cannot be said to constitute immediate co-operation. Nor do they
necessarily cover all areas of relevance. They are nonetheless welcome.”361

3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003

1193.  In his memoir, Mr Blair subsequently wrote:
“Having stated that it [co-operation] was increasing, which as he [Dr Blix] put it in
somewhat of an understatement, ‘may well be due to outside pressure’, he then
addressed the matter of interviews and documents:
‘It is obvious that, while the numerous initiatives, which are now taken by the Iraqi
side with a view to resolving some long-standing open disarmament issues, can be
seen as ‘active’ or even ‘pro-active’, these initiatives some 3-4 months into the new
resolution cannot be said to constitute ‘immediate co-operation.’
“Most of all, on the crucial matter of interviews, Blix was never going to get
co‑operation. That only came after March 2003 with the ISG [Iraq Survey Group, see
Section 4.4] …”362
1194.  The development of UK strategy and options from 8 March is addressed in
Section 3.8.

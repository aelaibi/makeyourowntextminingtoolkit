4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

Introduction and key findings
1.  This Section addresses:

•	
•	
•	

the assessment between late July and late September 2002 of Iraq’s capabilities
and intentions to develop, produce and use chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons and ballistic missiles;
the production of the Government dossier Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction.
The Assessment of the British Government, which was published on
24 September; and
Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons that day.

2.  A significant number of the documents relevant to the events considered in this
Section are already in the public domain, including:

•	
•	

documents published by the Hutton Inquiry, including the four drafts of the
dossier produced in September 2002; and
documents released in response to FOI requests.

3.  The Inquiry has examined most of the original, unredacted, versions of these
documents and, in some cases, is adding further information to that already in the public
domain. In a small number of cases, however, primarily emails given to the Hutton
Inquiry, the Government has been unable to provide copies of the original documents.
4.  The roles and responsibilities of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and the
Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) are addressed in Section 2.
5.  The development of UK strategy during the period addressed in this Section
is addressed in Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.
6.  The military planning for a campaign in which chemical and biological weapons
could be used, and in particular the arrangements to provide protection for UK forces,
are addressed in Section 6.1 to 6.3.

Key findings
•	

The urgency and certainty with which the Government stated that Iraq was a threat
which had to be dealt with fuelled the demand for publication of the dossier and led
to Mr Blair’s decision to publish it in September, separate from any decision on the
way ahead.

•	

The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary and public
support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required to secure
Iraq’s disarmament.

•	

The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is no
evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10
improperly influenced the text.

115

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that Saddam
Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons or that efforts
to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC should have made that clear
to Mr Blair.

•	

In his statement to Parliament on 24 September Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past,
current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential
threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point in the future
that threat would become a reality.

•	

The dossier’s description of Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the baseline
against which the UK Government measured Iraq’s future statements and actions
and the success of weapons inspections.

•	

The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the firmness
of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it more difficult to
secure support for Government policy, including military action, where the evidence
depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence.

•	

There are lessons which should be implemented in using information from JIC
Assessments to underpin policy decisions.

Late July and August 2002
Mr Blair’s meeting, 23 July 2002
7.  Mr Blair’s meeting on Iraq on 23 July did not take firm decisions and
he commissioned further advice and background material on the issues.
8.  On 23 July, Mr Blair discussed Iraq with Mr Jack Straw (the Foreign Secretary),
Mr Geoff Hoon (the Defence Secretary), Lord Goldsmith (Attorney General), Sir Richard
Wilson (Cabinet Secretary), Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff
(CDS)), Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)), Sir
Francis Richards (Head of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)),
Mr John Scarlett (Chairman of the JIC), Mr Jonathan Powell (Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff),
Baroness Morgan (Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations), Mr Alastair
Campbell (Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy) and Sir David Manning
(Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence
Secretariat (OD Sec)).1
9.  The meeting and the advice prepared for Mr Blair and other participants are
addressed in detail in Section 3.3.
10.  The Cabinet Office paper, ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’, which was prepared
to inform the discussion, was based on the assumption that Iraq was in possession of
prohibited weapons and material and was not complying with its UN obligations; but

it did not address the issue of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities
and intentions or the actual threat posed by Iraq’s WMD at that stage.2
11.  Sir Richard Dearlove discussed policy towards Iraq in a meeting with
Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, in Washington
on 19 July.3
12.  The report of that discussion stated that the US view was:

•	
•	
•	

There was “growing evidence of the construction of CBW production and links
to terrorists [in Iraq] stoking fears of a repeat 9/11 with WMD”.
There was a strong strategic case for removing Saddam Hussein. Continued
development of WMD was not in doubt.
A casus belli already existed.

13.  Sir Richard reported that he was told a US “decision [on action] had already been
taken – the question was only how and when”.
14.  Sir Richard also reported that, in a separate discussion with a senior US official,
he had been told that the US Administration’s intention was to set the threshold on UN
weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up US policy.
15.  Sir David Manning drew Mr Blair’s attention to the report, commenting:
“Not much doubt here that the Administration is bent on action soon, and convincing
itself that it has strong strategic, as well as a historical duty to act.
“Our views on links between Iraq, terrorism and development of WMD are different
from Condi’s: not proven at best …
…
“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] will be able to give the full picture tomorrow.”4
16.  Mr Powell commented: “Strengthens the need for and urgency of your note
to Bush.”5
17.  Sir David Manning gave Mr Blair an Annotated Agenda for the meeting on 23 July,
including inviting:

•	
•	

Mr Scarlett to set the scene with a “very brief summary” of the intelligence
on the position inside Iraq; and
Sir Richard Dearlove to provide a brief account of his recent talks in Washington.
He had returned “convinced that the Administration have moved up a gear”.6

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

18.  Sir David also identified questions Mr Blair might ask, including what sort of
battlefield environment was anticipated, and the response to any use of biological
weapons (BW) or chemical weapons (CW).
19.  The record of the 23 July meeting written by Mr Matthew Rycroft, one of Mr Blair’s
two Private Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, noted:

•	

•	

Mr Scarlett summarised the intelligence and latest [4 July] JIC Assessment:
“Saddam’s regime was tough and based on extreme fear. The only way to
overthrow it was likely to be by massive military action.” Saddam Hussein was
“worried and expected an attack”, but he was “not convinced” that an attack
would be “immediate or overwhelming”. Real support for Saddam Hussein was
“probably narrowly based”.
Sir Richard Dearlove reported that there was “a perceptible shift in attitude”
in Washington: “Military action was now seen as inevitable.” President Bush
“wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction
of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around
the policy. The NSC [National Security Council] had no patience with the UN
route and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime’s record.”7

20.  Mr Rycroft recorded that the meeting concluded that the UK “should work on the
assumption that the UK would take part in any military action”. Mr Blair also asked for
further advice on a number of issues, including that Mr Scarlett would send Mr Blair
a full intelligence update.
21.  In a separate record circulated more widely in Whitehall, Mr Rycroft wrote that
it had been suggested that Mr Scarlett provide a weekly update, on Friday mornings
for Mr Blair’s weekend box.8
22.  In his account of the meeting in his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote, in relation to the
points made on WMD, that:

•	
•	

Mr Straw had “said of the four powers posing a potential threat with WMD …
Iraq would be fourth. He [Saddam Hussein] does not have nukes, he has some
offensive WMD capability. The tough question is whether this is just regime
change or is the issue WMD.”
Mr Blair “said he needed to be convinced first of the workability of the military
plan, and second of an equally workable political strategy. Jack [Straw] said
we could probably get the votes for a UN ultimatum, but the Americans may
not want to go down that route. TB saw regime change as the route to dealing
with WMD.”9

23.  In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that he:
“… ran through the four countries that posed a potential threat to world peace
because of their unauthorised and highly dangerous weapons systems – North
Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq. I thought it important to raise the issue as to whether
we should contemplate not joining the US in any American military effort against
Iraq. I was concerned that the case against Iraq (why did it merit the most severe
action? what differentiated it from the other three?) had not at that stage been made:
and also about the potential consequences for Tony’s leadership, and the survival
of his government.”10
24.  Sir Richard told the Inquiry that he had had “quite contentious and difficult
conversations”. He had returned from Washington “deeply concerned that there was
momentum in parts of [US] Administration”, and he had warned Mr Blair about that
momentum.11 In relation to his “alleged comment” about the intelligence being fixed
around the policy, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that was really a reference to the attempts
“to join up terrorism and Iraq” with which he “radically disagreed”.
25.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s report of his meetings in Washington and the comment that
“the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy” are addressed in more
detail in Section 3.3.
26.  Sir David Manning asked Mr Scarlett for advice on a number of issues,
including a review of Saddam Hussein’s military capabilities and intentions.
27.  It is not clear what was said about Iraq’s WMD in Mr Blair’s meeting on 23 July,
but the following day Sir David Manning explained to Mr Blair his concern that:
“… we (and I suspect the Americans) have only a hazy idea of Saddam’s retaliatory
capabilities if and when we attack Iraq. CDS [Adm Boyce] was unable to say
whether we would expect to fight in a CBW [chemical and biological warfare]
environment. The answer has a crucial bearing on the plausibility and viability of US
military plans.”12
28.  Sir David wrote that he had “therefore, asked John Scarlett to review all the
intelligence on Saddam’s military capabilities and intentions, including:

•	
•	
•	

What military equipment do we think Saddam possesses, and in what state
of readiness?
In particular, does he [Saddam Hussein] have chemical and biological agents;
and if so, can he weaponise them?
If he can weaponise them, do we believe he can deliver them by missile
or aircraft?”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

29.  Sir David pointed out that Iraq had not used chemical or biological agents during
the 1991 Gulf Conflict, but he was unsure whether that was because Iraq did not have
the capability or for other reasons. He was:
“… anyway left very uneasy by Mike Boyce’s suggestion that the Americans
believe that Saddam would only use CBW as a last resort. If this is the American
assessment, it strikes me as alarmingly complacent. Saddam will know that once
the US launches an attack, the game is up. From his point of view, it will be last
resort time from the moment the first Marines hit the beach. And with all the wisdom
of the armchair strategist, it seems to me that the temptation to let fly at the Kuwait
bottleneck, with everything in his armoury, could be very strong indeed.”
30.  Mr Scarlett was also asked to “do more work on regime cohesion” in the light
of what Sir David described as “a risk of American wishful thinking”.
31.  Mr Scarlett subsequently provided a list of points on Iraq, to which he believed
answers were needed, for Sir David Manning to use during his visit to Washington
(see Section 3.3).13 The points on Iraq’s WMD were:
“•	 Iraq’s CBW and ballistic missile capability …

•	
•	

Saddam’s ‘red lines’ which would provoke him to use CBW against Coalition
Forces or his neighbours.
What would be the Israeli response to an Iraqi CBW attack?”

32.  A JIC Assessment addressing Sir David Manning’s questions about Iraq’s military
capabilities was produced on 9 September. That is addressed later in this Section.
33.  On 29 July, Sir David Manning delivered to Dr Rice a Note from Mr Blair
to President Bush.
34.  Mr Blair sent President Bush a “Note on Iraq” dated 28 July which was intended to
influence President Bush’s thinking on Iraq.14 The Note and the subsequent discussions
between Sir David Manning and senior members of the US Administration, including
President Bush, and Mr Blair’s own discussion with President Bush, are addressed
in Section 3.3.
35.  Mr Blair’s Note included six elements for “A Strategy for Achieving a Coalition”.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

36.  One of the elements was the need to explain why action to disarm Iraq was
necessary. In a paragraph on “The Evidence”, Mr Blair wrote that he had been told that
the US thought evidence was unnecessary but his view was “we still need to make the
case”. He suggested:
“If we recapitulate all the WMD evidence; add his [Saddam Hussein’s] attempts to
secure nuclear capability; and, as seems possible, add on the Al Qaida link, it will
be hugely persuasive over here. Plus … the abhorrent nature of the regime. It could
be done simultaneously with the deadline.”
37.  In a final section addressing “The Military Plan”, Mr Blair wrote that he had been
advised that there was a “risk of CW being used” if a military attack was launched which
did not result in the rapid collapse of the Iraqi regime.
38.  Sir David Manning had a “pre-meeting” with Mr Richard Armitage, the US Deputy
Secretary of State.15
39.  Sir David told the Inquiry that he had raised a number of detailed points with
Mr Armitage:
“… Why now? What if Saddam Hussein were to use weapons of mass destruction
during a military campaign? What would follow military action? What role … would
the United States see the United Nations playing, and what was the United States
planning to do about the Middle East Peace Process [MEPP]?”16
40.  Sir David said that he had told Mr Armitage that he “didn’t think we had answers to
those questions”. Mr Armitage had replied that he thought they needed a lot more work
and that: “It was better to be right than to hurry.”

“Summer reading”
41.  In response to a request from Mr Powell, Mr Scarlett sent Mr Blair “classified reading
material on Iraq” including two documents produced by the Defence Intelligence Staff
(DIS) on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq:17

•	
•	

‘Proliferation Study of Iraq’, providing an in-depth study of each of Iraq’s
programmes to develop weapons of mass destruction, produced in August
2002; and
an ‘aide memoire on Weapons of Mass Destruction and Proliferation’, including
Iraq, produced in June 2002.

121

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

42.  The first was a document of almost 500 pages, “designed to provide a
comprehensive reference and briefing document” for use by government departments,
providing details of:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq’s nuclear, chemical and biological programmes and their potential means
of delivery, particularly ballistic missiles;
procurement mechanisms in recent times;
the critical goods which Iraq would require for WMD-related programmes;
goods and technologies which Iraq was actively seeking;
developments in indigenous military production; and
Iraq’s conventional arms purchases.18

43.  The document replaced a version produced in 1996.
44.  A one-page summary of key judgements was provided, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

18 

The location and condition of the concealed Al Hussein missiles was “unknown”,
but there was “sufficient engineering expertise to make them operational”.
Iraq had “begun development” of ballistic missiles with a range of more than
1,000km, but it would “not be able to produce such a missile before 2007
provided sanctions remain effective”.
Iraq was “continuing to carry out research into nuclear weapons development
at a theoretical level” and intelligence indicated that it might have recalled its
nuclear scientists from civilian work in 1998.
Iraq might “be trying to develop centrifuge enrichment of uranium”, but that was
“likely to produce significant, if not insurmountable problems”.
“Some clandestine procurement has been attempted abroad using foreign
front companies. Many ‘dual-use’ items such as machine tools and electrical
equipment have been acquired which would be available for the nuclear
programme.”
It was assessed that Iraq had “no intention of restoring its CW agent production
to pre-Gulf Conflict levels” but it “could begin the production of mustard gas on
a significant scale at any time and the nerve agents sarin and VX within weeks”.
It was assessed that Iraq was “continuing to conceal the full extent of its BW
programme in order to preserve a limited offensive capability and that it could
revive its BW programme within a matter of weeks without much difficulty or
outside assistance”.
Iraq’s CBW production capability had “been dispersed to survive a military attack
and UN inspections”.

122

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

45.  The second document addressed several countries of concern.19 A two-page Annex
provided comments on Iraq.
46.  On Iraq’s nuclear weapons, the DIS stated that the intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear
weapons programme was “limited”. Saddam Hussein had held regular meetings with
Iraqi Atomic Energy personnel and expressed continuing support of atomic energy.
There was:
“No confirmed weapon-related facilities have been identified but some civil research
continues at Tuwaitha and rebuilding of Military Industrial Complex facilities
continues. Many scientists from the former nuclear weapons programme are known
to work at … al-Tahidi and may conduct nuclear-associated research. Any links
to a weapons programme have yet to be established.”
47.  On Iraq’s ballistic missiles systems, the DIS set out Iraq’s activities to develop short
range systems. On long-range missiles, it stated that Intelligence indicated Iraq had:

•	
•	
•	

a longer-range SCUD-derived missile “under development”. That was “probably
linked to the construction of a new large liquid propellant rocket engine static
test stand”;
continued work on longer-range systems but it was “unlikely to produce such
new systems within five years if sanctions remained effective”; and
“reported ambitions for missiles with ranges of 2,000 to 3,00km”.

48.  In addition, the DIS had “recently noted a world-wide drive to acquire productionlevel quantities of materials for making solid rocket motors and a continued emphasis
on guidance and control technology”.
49.  On Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes the DIS stated:

•	
•	
•	

There had been “some refurbishment” of the former CW precursor production
facility near Habbaniyah, but “this could not support large-scale CW agent
production”.
The possibility existed that Iraq had “a series of transportable production
facilities, although none have yet been identified, possibly as a result of denial
and deception”.
Iraq had “the necessary command and control structure necessary to deliver
CBW weapons”. There were “no specifics on preferred delivery options” but they
could, in the future, include the L-29 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).

50.  It is clear from the documents on the No.10 files that Mr Blair read the papers.

and Proliferation’.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

51.  When No.10 asked for reading material for Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer in September 2002, Mr Scarlett provided the same documents.20

Reservations about the wisdom of publishing the dossier
52.  As set out in Section 4.1, Mr Tom McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec, was asked in
March 2002 to chair an inter-departmental group to take forward work on the substance
of a paper for publication on Iraq.21 Mr Campbell was to retain the lead role on the form
of the document and timing of its publication.
53.  Mr McKane sent the latest versions of the “three Iraq public documents: on WMD,
Weapons Inspections and Abuse of Human Rights” to Sir David Manning on 21 June,
asking whether the three documents should be treated as a package or the WMD paper
should be published separately.22 Mr Scarlett’s preference was for the latter, but most
officials in the inter-departmental group thought the papers should be published together.
54.  Mr McKane also produced a draft Foreword “which could be issued in the name
of Mr Straw or jointly by him, Mr Hoon and Ms Short [the International Development
Secretary]”.
55.  On 16 July, Sir David Manning, Mr Powell and Mr Campbell agreed that publication
of the three papers on Iraq should be put on hold.23
56.  The Cabinet Office paper of 19 July recommended that Ministers should:
“Agree to the establishment of an ad hoc group of officials under Cabinet Office
chairmanship to consider the development of an information campaign to be agreed
with the US.”24
57.  There was no mention of that issue in the record of Mr Blair’s meeting on 23 July.25
58.  Mr McKane told the Inquiry that the proposal had come from the MOD and that he
had seen it as related to, but separate from, the production of the dossier.26 The dossier
seemed to him to be:
“… about putting the fact[s] before the British public in a way that would explain why
this [Iraq] was a problem and a problem that had to be dealt with.
“So … it might have formed an element of a broader information campaign.”

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

59.  On 5 August, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, wrote to
Sir David Manning suggesting that there was “a need to bolster our public lines on Iraq
for the summer while not changing our fundamental posture that no decision has been
taken on military action”.27
60.  Mr Watkins wrote that the Government was “likely to face a long hot summer of
media speculation about the possibility of military action”. He suggested strengthening
the presentation of existing lines and reinforcing them with recent quotes from Mr Blair
and others “about the WMD threat posed by Saddam Hussein”. MOD and FCO officials
were working on that but careful drafting would be required “to avoid foreshadowing the
document now under consideration in the Cabinet Office”. He added:
“The aim would be to reinforce the message that the threat is real, without
suggesting that we have determined any particular policy to counter it.”
61.  Mr Watkins suggested there was a need for “some closely held inter-departmental
thinking on a contingent information strategy in support of any decision to take military
action against Iraq”.
62.  Sir David Manning was not persuaded that action was needed immediately and
asked Ms Anna Wechsberg, one of Mr Blair’s two Private Secretaries for Foreign Affairs,
to follow up.28
63.  Sir David also sent a copy of the minute and his comments to Mr Scarlett.
64.  Ms Wechsberg spoke to Mr Hoon’s Private Office to say that No.10 was “not
enthusiastic” about the proposals. It was agreed that, unless the MOD identified “other
arguments for proceeding, the idea will be dropped for now”.29
65.  In a minute on 8 August, reporting developments while Mr McKane had been on
leave, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head OD Sec (Foreign Policy), wrote that, in the
context of the public debate on Iraq “raging on in the press”, Sir David Manning had
“been very clear that he wants no action taken on the release of the dossier or any
private briefing of those engaging in the debate”.30
66.  Mr Drummond also reported that Mr John Williams, FCO Press Secretary (formerly
Head of FCO News Department), had told Mr Straw that “releasing the dossier would be
a bad idea because it has insufficient evidence to convince public opinion”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

67.  Mr McKane had an interdepartmental meeting planned for 19 August. Mr Drummond
suggested that if it went ahead, it might be “small and informal to consider the options
for a press campaign if/when Ministers take political decisions about Iraq”.
68.  Mr Williams had written a minute on 2 August which prompted Mr Edward Chaplin,
FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, to write to Mr Andrew Patrick, FCO Head
of Newsroom, that: “Although the dossier includes some good material, it presents little
new evidence of Iraq’s WMD to justify a move away from our policy of containment/
deterrence.”31 He had discussed the issue with SIS who took “the same view”.
69.  Mr Chaplin suggested that special briefings for key foreign leaders would be
needed “in addition to any dossier”, to “convince them that the Iraqi WMD threat was
real, drawing on intelligence material more freely than would be possible in a public
document”.
70.  That might be extended to:
“… a selection of opinion-formers in the UK … In private briefings one could
be much more explicit about the threat, using recent JIC Assessments (SIS have
suggested that this could be done without undue threat to sources), plus a political
briefing and, perhaps, a description of the damage which a relatively small quantity
of WMD could inflict in urban areas of Britain.”
71.  Mr Chaplin also reported that another senior FCO official had pointed out the risk
of “binning the dossier, given that it has already been so heavily trailed”, and suggested
a briefing note could still be published “nearer the time of military action” along the lines
of a document on the “sins of Saddam” produced in 1998.
72.  Mr Chaplin suggested the message would be that:
“… there is still a serious potential threat to UK national security; action has to be
taken; the problem could still be resolved peacefully; but if Iraq pursues this route,
military action as a last resort is right.”
73.  Mr Chaplin concluded that, if Mr Patrick and Mr Williams thought his proposals
were “a runner”, the idea could be developed with the Cabinet Office and others and
submitted to Ministers “after the holiday season”.
74.  Mr Chaplin’s minute was sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Mike O’Brien,
Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and to Sir Michael Jay, FCO
Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and other senior officials.

75.  In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Williams wrote that he had been “instinctively
against the idea of a dossier” which seemed to him:
“… to rest on uncertainties, as by definition we did not know what Iraq had done
with weapons and materials which it had been told by the UN to account for, but
hadn’t. That is not to say I questioned the general concern about Iraq, only that I had
a feeling we would be in difficulty if we were asked for evidence of things that were
inherently unknown to the international community.”32
76.  Mr Williams added that he:
“… had no inkling that Iraq may no longer possess such weapons, only an anxiety
that we could not know the extent of weaponry which the UN was unable to inspect
or verify.”
77.  Mr Williams also wrote that his recollection was that “there was never a voice raised”
in Mr Straw’s presence, “or in the flow of paper … that ever raised doubts that Iraq still
possessed weapons of mass destruction”.33
78.  Mr Williams stated that he had done nothing about his concerns until August 2002,
when he “vividly” recalled that he felt “he had to do something”, and he wrote a note
asking Mr Straw, when he returned from holiday, to try to persuade Mr Blair “to forget
about a dossier”.34 He had argued that the Government should not take it upon itself
to prove what the inspectors had not been able to prove. The note was overtaken by
Mr Blair’s announcement at Sedgefield, which is addressed later in the Section, and
Mr Williams did not receive a response.
79.  The Government has been unable to find either Mr Williams’ minute of 2 August or
any subsequent minute to Mr Straw in August 2002. Mr Williams’ minute of 4 September
is addressed late in this Section.
80.  During an unpublicised visit to the US on 20 August, Mr Straw informed
Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, that:

•	
•	
•	

Mr Blair had been irritated to find himself in the position, where the US and
UK had been “outed” before they had been able to make the case with the
public for action against Iraq.
The UK’s draft dossier on Iraq did not in his view lead inexorably to
the conclusion that military action was the only way to deal with
Saddam Hussein.
A better case for action could be made.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

81.  When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell met on 20 August, they discussed Mr Blair’s
Note to President Bush of 28 July and its impact on thinking in the US.35
82.  In relation to Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell told Mr Straw
that dossiers on the “case for action” were being prepared:
“True believers would see a smoking gun no matter what. But most of the stuff Iraq
was importing was dual-use. It was not clear that the situation was any more serious
this year than last.”
83.  Mr Straw handed over a copy of the UK’s draft dossier:
“Although it made clear that Saddam was a very bad man, the contents did not
lead inexorably to the conclusion that the only way to deal with him was by military
action.”
84.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he had discussed the position with Mr Blair the
previous day. Mr Blair was concerned and had:
“… asked him to stress that the problem was that we had been ‘outed’ long before
we had been able to make the case with the public for action …”
85.  Addressing the “public case”, Mr Straw said that the UK dossier:
“… needed a compelling last chapter. We could make a better case than the one
we had made so far. Traditional Cold War-style containment did not work for WMD.
Rogue states did not have as much at stake as the Soviet bloc.”
86.  On 19 August, Mr McKane chaired a “restricted” inter-departmental meeting
on an information strategy on Iraq.36
87.  The MOD had provided an outline of the shape an information strategy might
take, with the objectives of attaining “domestic acquiescence” and regional and
international support.
88.  The meeting also discussed the forthcoming International Institute of Strategic
Studies (IISS) report (on Iraq’s WMD). It was perceived as “useful”, but the UK should
“resist any calls” to publish the dossier, “which would be seen by the media as a positive
indication of UK preparations for a military operation against Iraq”.
89.  In conclusion, Mr McKane:
“… re-iterated the sensitive nature of the meeting. It was important that no work was
taken forward in the absence of a policy decision, and that no action was taken that
might be misconstrued by the media as an indication of the UK’s policy decision.”

90.  It is not clear who attended the meeting as the record was not sent to participants.
91.  Mr McKane described the meeting to the Inquiry as a “throat clearing exercise”.37
92.  Reporting on a meeting on 22 August to update Sir David Manning on developments
concerning Iraq, Mr Tom Dodd, a junior official in OD Sec, wrote that the IISS would be
publishing “an academic dossier” on Iraqi WMD on 9 September:
“Officials have considered whether we should publish our own dossier in advance or
shortly afterwards. However they feel that the HMG dossier should only be published
in the context of Ministerial decisions on a policy change towards Iraq and as part of
a fully-fledged media campaign.”38

Revision of the WMD paper
93.  Mr Scarlett had been working on the WMD paper in the dossier during August.
94.  On 8 and 9 August, there was an email exchange between the Assessments Staff
and the MOD about whether there was evidence available on Iraq’s ballistic missile work
outside the activities permitted by the UN:

•	

•	
•	

•	

The MOD was asked if it could provide two to three “examples of ballistic missile
related sites” which were relevant to the claim that Iraq was breaking the limit
of 150km range permitted by the UN.39 Mr Scarlett was “keen” to include them
in the dossier. The MOD was also asked for “an explanation of the shed going
up at al-Rafah”, which Mr Scarlett also wanted to mention.
The MOD replied that it was not sure what it could provide but it would “see what
we can do”.40
In a subsequent email, the MOD stated that al-Rafah was a known engine test
site, which had been bombed in 1991 and December 1998.41 It was “no surprise”
that Iraq was putting “a lid on the new stand to prevent imagery observation of
test objects – the implication being that the stand is nearing completion and/or
there will be something to test on it”.
The MOD also commented: “You will recall that … we said that … points about
buildings being reconstructed … rely on inference and comparisons with what
they were trying to do before the Gulf War with BADR-2000. A big assembly
building does not automatically make large missiles … If the Chairman wants

to make the UK paper into a smaller clone of […] … I would tend towards relying
on quality …”
The MOD suggested “Further to your request to make the public paper more
exciting”, text describing facilities which had “potential applicable to production
of the prohibited long-range missile that Iraq is known to be developing”, and a
reference to “concerted efforts to acquire additional manufacturing technology
for its missile programmes” with some items “inevitably” slipping through the
embargo.42

95.  On 19 August, Ms Jane Hamilton-Eddy, one of the Deputy Heads of the
Assessments Staff, sent a further draft of the dossier to the DIS. She wrote that
Mr Scarlett had recently reviewed the document, and made changes. The presentation
of the CBW sections had been revised “to bring out more clearly our judgements”
although the text itself was “not new”.43 Mr Scarlett was also:
“… particularly keen to include examples of suspicious facilities, so can I ask that
we look closely at the relevant areas to see if anything more can be said.”
96.  Ms Hamilton-Eddy added that the aim was to have the revised document ready
“by the end of the summer break”.
97.  While the revised draft largely contained the same material as the draft sent to
Sir David Manning by Mr McKane on 21 June (see Section 4.1), there were a small
number of additions.44 Those included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

In relation to the material for which the inspectors had been unable to account,
Iraq’s “declarations to UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] deliberately obscure
the picture”.
“Iraq’s military forces maintain the capability to use these weapons, with
command, control and logistical arrangements in place.”
“Facilities of concern include the Castor Oil Production Plant at Habbinayah,
which could be used in the production of ricin … and the Al-Dawrah Foot and
Mouth Disease Vaccine Plant, which was involved in BW agent production
before the Gulf War.”
Details of the possible delivery means for chemical and biological agents.
“Following the expulsion of weapons inspectors in 1998 Iraq has increased
[covert efforts to acquire technology and materials with nuclear applications].
There is compelling evidence that Iraq has sought the supply of significant
quantities of uranium from Africa.”

The new facilities at al-Rafah “would not be needed for systems that fall within

The UK did not “know where CBW work was being conducted – by its nature it
can be conducted in small facilities or labs … Even if only a few litres of agent
a day had been manufactured in the 1,200 or so days since UNSCOM left,
a considerable stockpile could have been built up.”
Iraq had a capability to produce biological “agents” as well as weapons.
Iraq had repeatedly claimed that the agents in “unaccounted for CW weapons
would have deteriorated sufficiently to render the weapons harmless. But this
was found not to be the case by UNSCOM when they examined Iraqi weapons,
many years after they and [sic] been filled (in fact the inclusion of stabilisers in
the nerve agent would prevent decomposition).”
Iraq had admitted that it had 75 chemical warheads for SCUD type missiles.
It had “nothing else to offer” on Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes.
Iraq had started to take journalists to facilities to “demonstrate that they
are benign”.
Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, had recently stated that
there were “some 700 sites” in Iraq the inspectors would like to visit. None were
“proven WMD sites” and if specific facilities were mentioned in a public dossier,
there was a risk Iraq would target those facilities for visits by journalists “in an
attempt to undermine the impact of the dossier”.45

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

JIC Assessment, 21 August 2002: ‘Iraq: Saddam’s Diplomatic and
Military Options’
99.  A JIC Assessment of 21 August concluded that in a conflict Saddam Hussein
would order missile strikes and the use of CBW against Coalition Forces,
supporting regional states and Israel.
100.  The JIC had little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW and little insight into how
it would fight. Its conclusions reflected the Committee’s own judgements.
101.  In relation to Saddam Hussein’s intentions to use CBW and missile strikes,
the sense of certainty that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons and that it
would use them in the Key Judgements reflected a wider judgement than could
have been derived from the information in the Assessment itself.
102.  At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment on 21 August
considering “what diplomatic options Saddam has to deter, avert or limit the scope
of a US-led attack”.46 The judgements on these issues are set out in Section 3.4.
103.  In addition, the Assessment considered Saddam Hussein’s “military options for
facing a US-led attack” and how his analysis about each course of action might “change
as an attack becomes increasingly imminent”. It examined Iraq’s options for the short
term, whether Saddam Hussein might seize the initiative, how Iraq might respond to
a US military build-up, Saddam’s options in “war” – including the use of missiles and
WMD, and “alternative scenarios and at the death”.
104.  Iraq’s options for the use of weapons of mass destruction were considered “only
briefly” as the JIC would assess those in early September, but the JIC offered two
Key Judgements:

•	
•	

“Early on in any conflict, Saddam would order missile attacks on Israel, Coalition
Forces and regional states providing the US with bases.”
“Saddam would order the use of CBW against Coalition Forces at some point,
probably after a Coalition attack had begun. Once Saddam was convinced
that his fate was sealed, he would order the unrestrained use of CBW against
Coalition Forces, supporting regional states and Israel.”

105.  The Assessment stated that “Saddam would probably order missile attacks” and
the JIC judged that attacks on Israel would be “an attempt to attract Israeli retaliation and
thus widen the war, split the Coalition and arouse popular opinion in the Arab States”.
Missiles “could be armed with chemical or biological warfare (CBW) agents”, although
“Saddam might be deterred at least initially by the threat of Israeli nuclear retaliation.”

JIC Assessment, 21 August 2002, ‘Iraq: Saddam’s Diplomatic and Military Options’.

132

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

106.  The Assessment also stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq had a “limited number of long-range missiles … available”; the JIC
assessed “12-20 650km range Al Hussein missiles”.
Iraq had produced more than 50 Al Samoud missiles with a range of 150km.
Attacks on Coalition Forces in Kuwait would require Iraq to deploy short-range
missiles into the “No Drive Zone [south of the 32nd parallel – imposed in
resolution 949 (1994)]”.
A pre-emptive missile attack on Israel was “less likely because it would show
Iraq had been lying about its retention of long-range missiles”.

107.  Although it had “little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW doctrine” and knew “little about
Iraq’s CBW work since late 1998”, the JIC judged it “likely that Saddam would order the
use of CBW against Coalition Forces at some point, probably after Coalition attacks had
begun”. Iraqi CBW use “would become increasingly likely the closer Coalition Forces
came to Baghdad. Military targets might include troop concentrations or important fixed
targets in rear areas such as ports and airfields.”
108.  Addressing the possibility of “Alternative scenarios and at the death” the
Assessment also stated:

•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein “might pursue an extreme course of action at an earlier stage”
if he judged it to be “worth the risk of providing the US with overt justification
to attack”.
Unorthodox options might include “the early or pre-emptive use of CBW”;
“CBW terrorism: although Saddam probably lacks the capability to deploy
a sophisticated device, he could cause widespread panic”.
“Should he feel his fate is sealed, Saddam’s judgement might change to ‘bring
the temple down’ on his enemies no matter what the cost”. At that stage,
“Saddam would order the unrestrained use of CBW against Coalition Forces,
supporting regional states and Israel, although he would face practical problems
of command and control, the loyalty of his commanders, logistics problems and
the availability of chemical and biological agents in sufficient quantities to be
effective and the means to deliver them.”

109.  The Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction, the Butler
Report, stated:
“The Key Judgements … would rightly have been prepared on a precautionary
basis. Perhaps for that reason, we have observed that when set against the
intelligence on Iraqi programmes contained in advice to Ministers in March [2002],
the JIC assessment reflected more firmly the premise that Iraq had chemical and
biological weapons and would use them in war. Underpinning this must have been

133

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

a presumption that, if Iraq did not have stocks of these weapons, it would quickly
produce agent, weaponise it and deploy weapons to units …”47
110.  The Butler Report also stated:
“We were told that the JIC’s conclusions were based in part on one human
intelligence report from one source, but mainly on the JIC’s own judgements. They
thus represent an insight into the views of JIC members of Iraq’s chemical and
biological weapons capabilities at that time.”48
111.  Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff from September 2001 to November
2003, told the Inquiry that the Assessment had:
“… picked up a report from an established source which referred to the intention to
use weapons. I think it didn’t distinguish between chemical and biological. It implied
both were intended to be used. […]”49

Dr Blix’s interview, 25 August 2002
Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, gave an interview on NBC’s Meet
the Press programme on 25 August.50
Asked whether Iraq possessed biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, Dr Blix
responded that there were “many open questions” but the inspectors did not have
proof that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.
Dr Blix also pointed out that “an absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence”.
Other points made by Dr Blix are set out in Section 3.4.

Mr Blair’s position at the end of August 2002
112.  In August, debate in the US about whether military action would be taken against
Iraq intensified.
113.  The events and debate within the UK Government before Mr Blair’s press
conference in Sedgefield on 3 September are addressed in Section 3.4.
114.  On 26 August, in a major speech to a National Conference of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars on the threat from terrorism, the US Vice President, Mr Dick Cheney,
stated that Saddam Hussein had “made a science out of deceiving the international

community”.51 The “Iraqi regime has in fact been very busy enhancing its capabilities
in the field of chemical and biological weapons” and that “we now know that Saddam
has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons … Many of us are convinced that
Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.”
115.  Vice President Cheney added that there was “no doubt” that Saddam Hussein
had weapons of mass destruction and was “amassing them to use against our friends,
against our allies, and against us”.
116.  In a telephone call on 29 August, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed Iraq,
including the need to make clear that Iraq was the UN’s problem and that the issue was
total disarmament of Iraq’s WMD and associated systems not just the reintroduction of
inspectors.52 Mr Blair:
“… wanted the UN to meet that challenge, but if it could not we would have to act.
So we should remake the case, put together the evidence against Saddam, and
work up a UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution] …”
117.  When Mr Blair returned to No.10 after his holiday, he set out his concerns
about the public debate, and that he and President Bush had been “outed” as
having decided on military action when no decisions had been taken.
118.  As part of a wider note to No.10 officials on 30 August about the strategy on Iraq,
Mr Blair set out his position:
“I don’t need any convincing as to where we are on this. The state of opinion, the
difficulties. The problems are compounded by the fact that [President] Bush and
myself have been ‘outed’ as having decided for war, come what may, when actually
no decisions have been taken. So the arguments are all being made against any
action, when we are not yet in a position to make the arguments for it. But all this
can be turned round in time, with the right strategy.
“My basic view on Iraq is clear and hard. The policy of containment … has worked
up to a point, but can’t continue indefinitely; there is no doubt that, uncontained,
Iraq is a threat; they are trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability; they are
developing ballistic missile capability for biological and chemical weapons of a
longer-range; they retain substantial WMD stocks …
“Opinion against action divides into two: those always opposed and the usual
anti-American lobby; and those, a large number, who ask entirely sensible
questions, but who might support action if the questions were answered.”53

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

119.  Mr Blair stated: “The basic strategy should be to answer these questions and,
in doing so, set … Iraq in a bigger context.” The steps to do that included:

•	
•	

raising the whole issue of WMD up the agenda with a separate strategy for each
country developing WMD, “in particular [those] acquiring nuclear technology
in secret”; and
setting out the “unique danger posed by Iraq … an inherently violent and
unstable regime, with a track record of external aggression, unmitigated
by any moderate elements unlike other WMD countries”.

September 2002
Mr Blair’s decision to publish the dossier
120.  On 2 September, Mr Campbell wrote to Sir David Manning, Mr Powell and
Mr Rycroft, saying that Mr Blair was “alarmed, and angry, at the way parts of our thinking
and planning on Iraq are seeping into the media in an uncoordinated and undisciplined
way”.54 “Above all”, Mr Blair was “concerned what the US Administration must think”.
Mr Blair intended to use his press conference the following day (in his Sedgefield
constituency) to make the general position clear and “give people a public script”.
121.  The FCO advice to Mr Blair before the press conference in Sedgefield
on 3 September 2002 stated unequivocally that Iraq had and was hiding WMD;
and that it had continued its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile
programmes after the departure of UN weapons inspectors in December 1998.
122.  The FCO advice conflated past, present and potential future capabilities
and conveyed a sense of certainty about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions
without acknowledging that the judgements were inferential and that there were
uncertainties about Iraq’s current capabilities and caveats about the absence
of intelligence in the existing JIC Assessments.
123.  The FCO asserted the belief that Iraq had recently accelerated its weapons
programmes, but it did not substantiate that assertion.
124.  In preparation for his press conference in Sedgefield, Mr Blair asked for information
on a number of issues, including a summary of:

•	

54 
55 

“what we knew of the existing Iraqi WMD programme, in particular ballistic
missile technology (and its significance); and nuclear weapons technology
(including why the civil nuclear programme they are funding is almost certainly
misused for weapons programmes)”.55

125.  The FCO response was sent to No.10 on 2 September by Mr Mark Sedwill, one
of Mr Straw’s Private Secretaries who had been attached to UNSCOM between 1996
and 1998.56
126.  Addressing the question “Does Iraq possess WMD?”, the FCO stated:
“Yes. Iraq is still hiding weapons of mass destruction in a range of locations. The
regime has admitted hiding chemical, biological weapons and missile parts …
“The Iraqi regime has admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare
agents … It has also admitted … producing biological warfare agents …
“In the course of their work between 1991 and 1998, UN weapons inspectors
were unable to account for thousands of tonnes of so-called precursor chemicals
used in the production of weapons; hundreds of tonnes of chemicals used in the
production of VX nerve agent; up to a dozen ballistic missiles with a range of over
600 kilometres; and tens of thousands of special munitions which can be used in
chemical and biological weapons.”
127.  Addressing “Developments in Iraq’s WMD programmes Since the Last
Inspections?”, the FCO stated:
“… the Baghdad regime continues to pursue ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical
and biological programmes in breach of its UN obligations.
“We believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its weapons programmes.
For example:
“Saddam’s ballistic missile programme has made continued progress and facilities
damaged by Operation Desert Fox in 1998 have been repaired. We believe that
he is planning to extend the range of his current missiles beyond the 150km limit
imposed by the UN …
“We have reports of increased nuclear procurement. We think R&D on a nuclear
weapons programme has restarted. If sanctions are lifted, we believe that Saddam
could develop a nuclear weapon within 5 years. If he were able to procure fissile
material from outside Iraq, then he might possess a nuclear capability in a much
shorter timeframe.
“We believe that the Iraqi regime continues its biological and chemical weapons
programmes.”
128.  The FCO advised Mr Blair that Iraq did not have an active civil nuclear programme
and that almost all its facilities had been dismantled after 1991. The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected “the small quantity of radioactive material which
Iraq was permitted to keep for research”. The FCO added: “In these circumstances,
56

137

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

it is more important than ever that the … inspectors are given unconditional and
unrestricted access …”
129.  The FCO stated that “UN measures” had “played a vital role in frustrating
Saddam’s ambitions to develop WMD” and described the new sanctions regime adopted
by the UN on 14 May 2002 as demonstrating “that the international community remains
united in its determination to control the export of military-related items to Iraq”.
130.  In response to a potential suggestion that the absence of the promised dossier
demonstrated the weakness of the Government’s case, the FCO stated:
“Not at all. The scale of the Iraqi WMD programme uncovered by UN inspectors
in the 1990s demonstrates the extent of Saddam’s ambitions. And his previous
use of chemical agents against his own people demonstrates that he will show
no compunction in using such weapons.
“… All of our intelligence reporting, revelations from Iraqi defectors and past
experience tells us that Iraq is taking advantage of absence of inspections to revive
its chemical, biological and nuclear programmes.”
131.  The FCO also referred to the examples of past Iraqi concealment and deceit
identified in UNSCOM’s final report in 1999.
132.  The FCO stated that further details on Iraq’s WMD programmes were set out
in the draft dossier on Iraq, which had been produced earlier in the year for possible
publication.
133.  A separate FCO brief on the policy of containment stated:

•	

The purpose of the policy (of containment) had been to ensure that Iraq was
disarmed through two main elements:
{{ disarmament

through inspections regimes; and

{{ reducing

•	
•	
•	

Iraq’s ability to finance its WMD programmes by controlling its
revenues from oil.

The policy had “some success in dismantling Saddam’s arsenal when the
inspectors were able to operate”, and it had “slowed his efforts to rebuild WMD”.
The arms embargo had “been effective in preventing Saddam acquiring new
complete weapons systems”.
But, “in the absence of inspectors”, Iraq could “work on its WMD programmes
unimpeded” and Iraq was “in violation of a string of Security Council resolutions
intended to curb” those programmes.
Controls on revenues were “eroding”, giving Saddam “access to large sums
over which the international community had no control” and “much” of that was
“certainly going into his high-priority WMD programmes”.

138

•	

Although the sanctions regime had been “targeted on goods of most concern”,
no sanctions regime would “be completely effective in stopping a ruthless and
well-funded regime getting its hands on some of the goods and technology
needed for a WMD programme”.57

134.  In his press conference, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein was, “without
any question, still trying to develop” a “chemical, biological, potentially nuclear
capability”; and that to allow him to do so would be “irresponsible”.
135.  Mr Blair announced that the “dossier” setting out the evidence of Iraq’s
attempts to develop its “chemical, biological and potentially nuclear capability”
would be published in the “next few weeks”.
136.  Mr Campbell wrote that the hardest question to answer was “Why now?”
137.  On 3 September, in his Sedgefield press conference, which lasted 90 minutes,
Mr Blair stated:
“… I think I would be right in saying that many of your questions will be on Iraq …
I sense that some of you believe we have taken all the key decisions but just haven’t
got round to telling you. That isn’t the case … We, at every level of government,
have been and remain in close dialogue with the United States of America about this
issue and where we are in absolute agreement is that Iraq poses a real and unique
threat to the security of the region and the rest of the world. But Saddam Hussein
is continuing in his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction … We have to
face up to it, we have to deal with it and will. The issue is then what is the best way
of proceeding.”58
138.  A number of questioners pointed out that public opinion had moved against the
idea of a strike against Iraq “partly because people feel that there hasn’t been much
evidence … We have heard again and again that there is a dossier of evidence about
Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Why haven’t we got it up to now and
when are we going to see it?” Would there be any evidence in the dossier which had
been “gleaned in the last four years” that Saddam Hussein had “moved any further down
the route to nuclear weapons? There were suggestions that there was “not going to be
much new”; and that, in terms of public opinion, there was “a mountain to climb”.
139.  In response to the first question, Mr Blair replied:
“Originally I had the intention that we wouldn’t get round to publishing the dossier
until we’d actually taken the key decisions. I think it is probably a better idea to bring
that forward.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

140.  Mr Blair added: “A lot of the work has already been done, there needs to be some
more work and some more checking” but “the best thing to do is to publish … within the
next few weeks”. When that happened:
“… people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that
Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any
question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability
and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry
on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.”
141.  In terms of the specifics of Iraq’s WMD, Mr Blair made a number of
comments including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“… there is no doubt that at some point the Iraqi regime were trying to develop
nuclear weapons … I believe that there is evidence that they will acquire nuclear
weapons capability if they possibly can.”
“Now we will provide what support we can for that, although of course the
absence of inspectors … means there is necessarily a limit. But I don’t think
we should be in any doubt about the nature of this regime, they will acquire
whatever weapons they possibly can.”
“Certainly they were trying to obtain a nuclear weapons capability. I think there
is some evidence that they continued to do so.”
“… [W]e don’t really know what is happening now, there are huge amounts
of stocks of chemical, biological weapons unaccounted for.”
“… [W]e can’t be quite sure what is happening on the nuclear side … but on the
biological and chemical weapons side there is no doubt about it, there are vast
stocks of these weapons unaccounted for by the previous weapons inspectors.”
“And in addition there is real concern that there is ballistic missile technology.”

142.  Mr Blair suggested that the reason Iraq might not be letting inspections take place
was because “the last time the inspectors were in there, they uncovered so much that
the Iraqi regime was deeply embarrassed”. He also argued that people would “think
about it differently once they see the evidence”.
143.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diary on 3 September:
“The hardest [question] was: ‘Why now? What was it that we knew now that we
didn’t before that made us believe we had to do it now?’ It was not going to be
at all easy to sell the policy in the next few months …”59

144.  Mr Campbell added that announcing the publication of the dossier would “raise
expectations massively. Today was about beginning to turn the tide of public opinion and
it was going to be very tough indeed.”
145.  The Inquiry asked Mr Blair for a statement addressing whether, before his press
conference in Sedgefield, he had refreshed his memory in relation to the 15 March 2002
JIC Assessment, ‘The Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’.60
146.  In his statement, Mr Blair wrote:
“The basis for the statements I made on the issue of Saddam and WMD were
based, of course, on the JIC Assessments and on the whole history of Saddam
and WMD going back over many years, including his use of chemical weapons, the
findings of previous UN inspectors, his well documented attempts at concealment.
“… [F]or my press conference at Sedgefield … I requested and received a special
briefing from the FCO. I would probably also have re-read the JIC report of
15 March 2002 and the list of unaccounted for items from the UNSCOM reports.
I draw attention to the first part of the [FCO] briefing of 2 September 2002, in
particular to the reference that ‘we believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its
weapons programme’; ‘increased nuclear procurement’; and to the fact that UN
inspectors in 1998 ‘were unable to account for thousands of tonnes of so-called
precursor chemicals’.”61
147.  As Section 4.1 sets out, the decision to produce a document for publication setting
out the facts on WMD in relation to countries of concern, including Iraq, was taken in
mid-February 2002 and was briefed to the press shortly thereafter.62
148.  Speculation about the publication of a document on Iraq’s WMD and its
significance in relation to a decision about military action against Iraq had continued
throughout the spring and summer of 2002.
149.  On 16 July, No.10 decided to put publication on hold and that further decisions
would be needed on its precise form.63
150.  On the same day, Mr Blair had told the Liaison Committee that if policy on Iraq
moved into a new phase, a document would be published.64

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

151.  Asked what had led to his change of mind in early September and the decision
to publish the dossier, Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:
“What changed was really two things which came together. First … there was
a tremendous amount of information and evidence coming across my desk as
to the weapons of mass destruction and the programmes … that Saddam had.
“There was also a renewed sense of urgency, again, in the way that this was being
publicly debated …
“President Bush and I had a telephone call towards the end of that [August] break
and we decided … we really had to confront this issue, devise our strategy and get
on with it and I took the view … that we really had to disclose what we knew or as
much as we could of what we knew.”65
152.  Mr Blair added: “The aim of the dossier was to disclose the reason for our concern
and the reason why we believed this issue had to be confronted.”
153.  Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:
“… wanted to publish information as he saw it was because he thought it was
important that the public were as aware as possible of the pressures that he had
seen coming across his desk.”66
154.  Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that the decision to bring forward the publication of
the dossier was a way of trying to calm the situation.67 Mr Blair had wanted “to set out
for the public, in as accessible a way as possible, the reasons why he had become more
concerned” about Iraq.
155.  In his memoir, published in 2010, Mr Blair wrote:
“One other rather fateful decision was taken at that time. Reasonably enough,
people wanted to see the evidence on Saddam and WMD. This evidence was
contained in intelligence. It was not practice, for obvious reasons, to disclose
intelligence. We decided we had to do it. Many times afterwards, I regretted the
decision. The ‘dossier’, as it was called, later became the subject of the most vicious
recrimination and condemnation. In reality, it was done because we could see no
way of refusing it, given the clamour for it. The very unprecedented nature of it was,
however, part of the problem. Both opponents and supporters of the war were urging
us to share with the public the evidence we had.”68

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

156.  In his memoir, published in 2012, Mr Straw wrote:
“Earlier in the summer there had been a mounting and understandable clamour
for more and more explanation about why we and the US were now taking the
threat from Iraq so much more seriously than we had before 9/11. People assumed
we must know much more than we were letting on. Through the CIA [Central
Intelligence Agency], SIS and the other agencies, we did … have access to what we
believed to be reliable intelligence about Saddam’s continuing intentions in respect
of his banned weapons. The mistake we made – on both sides of the Atlantic – was
to believe that the best way to respond was to include a declassified summary of
some of the intelligence in the dossier.”69
157.  Mr Blair’s announcement galvanised thinking on the draft Iraq dossier.
158.  On 2 September, in response to a discussion with Mr Rycroft about “the need for
a capping piece for the Iraq dossier currently sitting on the shelf”, Mr McKane provided
a draft, which set out “the argument for effective action against Saddam Hussein”.70
159.  Mr McKane concluded:
“If you or David think the draft is worth developing and refining, the next step would
be for me to circulate it … We should also, as you and I agreed, be considering
whether there is more up to date material which could be incorporated in the
dossier itself.”
160.  The draft referred to the general threat from the spread of chemical and biological
weapons and stated that Saddam Hussein’s regime was a “particularly dangerous
example” of that general threat because of “his track record and his continuing flouting
of international norms of behaviour. That is why it is so important to deal now with the
threat he represents.”
161.  The draft also stated:

•	
•	

69 
70 

Since 1998, the UN had “tried repeatedly to persuade Saddam to comply” with
his obligations, but he had sought “At every turn … to divert attention from his
failure to comply.” The “only reasonable explanation” for that “prevarication” was
that “he has something to hide, something he is unwilling to give up”.
“… [W]e cannot wait for ever for the right answer from Saddam, when all the
time he is engaged in work on weapons which could threaten our [sic] own
population and certainly the population of his neighbours. If we were to do so,
particularly after 11 September, and our patience were to be rewarded with
another devastating attack, we would rightly be castigated for our inaction.”

Minute McKane to Rycroft, 2 September 2002, ‘Iraq’.

143

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

The facts in the dossier “as a whole” presented a picture of a regime which
was “so opposed to international norms of behaviour that it must be confronted
effectively now”.

162.  Mr Rycroft suggested that Mr McKane should develop the draft.71
163.  Sir David Manning wrote: “Yes. Let’s see what the response is.”72
164.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr McKane wrote that Mr Blair:
“… had decided the dossier should be ready for publication within weeks, in
order to explain publicly why effective action had to be taken to counter the threat
posed by Iraq. This is brought out in the draft ‘capping piece’ which I sent to
Matthew Rycroft …”73
165.  Asked about the origins of the capping note, Mr McKane told the Inquiry that it
“followed an exchange with either Sir David Manning or Matthew Rycroft in which we
agreed that the draft needed something … which would encapsulate the main points”.74
166.  Mr McKane subsequently stated:
“I suppose what I was doing was trying to answer the question: why should we take
action now? So it is related to the shift in approach that was marked by the meeting
on 23 July and the greater sense of pace and urgency that was injected thereafter.”75
167.  Following the Sedgefield press conference, Dr Michael Williams, Mr Straw’s
Special Adviser, wrote to Mr Straw reporting that the Director of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies (IISS) had informed him that it would be publishing its dossier
on the threat posed by Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction and past
practices of deception in relation to UN inspections.76 Dr Williams thought that it would
“be helpful in moving towards a more informed debate about Iraq which is long overdue”.
168.  Commenting on the draft UK dossier, Dr Williams wrote that he shared many
of Mr John Williams’ views:
“The text I’ve seen is not significantly different from one I saw in late Spring.
“It is certainly not a ‘killer’ dossier. The material is often poorly presented
and would benefit from professional editing to make it a sharper assessment.

I am surprised that we do not have stronger material … We need, I believe, to
regard the publication of the strongest material as a political imperative.”
169.  Mr McKane wrote to Mr Stephen Wright, FCO Deputy Under Secretary Defence
and Intelligence, on 4 September asking the FCO to renew the chapters in the dossier
it had produced on ‘Human Rights Abuses’ and the ‘History of Weapons Inspections’
to “ensure they are as up to date and hard hitting as possible”.77
170.  Mr McKane stated that Mr Scarlett had “already started work to refresh the WMD
chapter” and asked for comments on the draft capping piece.
171.  Sir David Manning replied:
“This looks good.
“Let’s point out that there has been no monitoring since ?1998 when the inspectors
were expelled in violation of UNSCRs.”78
172.  The Assessments Staff had already sought more information from the DIS.79
173.  The DIS provided additional material on:

•	
•	
•	
•	

missile numbers on 4 September;80
“Nuclear Weapons” on 5 September;81
WMD funding on 6 September;82 and
chemical facilities on 6 September.83

The FCO position on the problem posed by Iraq
174.  The FCO was also developing a script addressing why the problem of Iraq’s
WMD, unlike the programmes of other countries, including Iran, could not be
resolved through containment and diplomacy.
175.  The argument relied on Saddam Hussein’s past behaviour and his
continuing refusal at that time to admit weapons inspectors as required
by resolution 1284 (1999).

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

176.  With its advice to No.10 on “possible UNSCRs and a game plan for securing
them” of 4 September, which is addressed in Section 3.4, Mr Straw’s Private Office
also provided:

•	
•	

a “script on why the problem of Iraqi WMD was being treated differently from
other WMD programmes”; and
a “note setting out the broader problem of WMD proliferation and the action
we are taking to tackle it”.84

177.  The script on Iraq’s WMD stated that there were:
“… particular concerns about Iraq’s WMD programmes. Since Iraq’s persistent
obstruction forced the UN Inspectors to leave in 1998, Iraq has maintained its
chemical and biological weapons programmes, and is developing ballistic missiles
capable of delivering them to targets beyond the 150km limit imposed by the UN
for defensive systems.”
178.  The “key differences between Iraq and other countries such as Iran and
North Korea” were that:

•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein had used WMD.

•	

Iraq was “in flagrant violation” of 14 UN Security Council resolutions relating to
its WMD and missile programmes, and was in violation of nine of the remaining
13 obligations on other issues.

UNSCOM had uncovered the scale of his programmes.
Iraq had “been shown to have broken every commitment it has ever made
under the NPT [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons] and BTWC
[Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention] (it is not a member of the CWC
[Chemical Weapons Convention])”.

179.  The script added that the UK approaches “to Iraq and to other governments with
WMD programmes of concern” were “fundamentally identical”: political and diplomatic
engagement. But:
“… in the case of Iraq, the diplomatic route has been constantly obstructed by
Saddam’s intransigence and duplicity, and has been blocked altogether since
Inspectors left in 1998 – leaving us no alternative but to consider other options.”
180.  The note, ‘Proliferation of WMD: The Wider Context’, described the “wider problem
of the proliferation of WMD and long-range missiles” and “An additional increased
concern since 11 September 2001” that international terrorists would obtain WMD.
Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya and Syria were identified as “priorities for counter-action
… (as the most likely to pose a threat to the UK, our allies, or deployed UK forces)”.

84 

146

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

181.  The note stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The UK was “keen to raise awareness of the WMD and missile threat beyond
the US/UK partnership, to draw others into closer co-operation in countering
the threat”.
“[M]ain efforts over the past year” had been directed “at key EU partners –
particularly the French and Germans”.
The UK was the US “partner of choice in countering WMD and missile
proliferation”.
The US Administration was “clearly more interested in deploying tools at the
robust end of the spectrum”, including “direct action”, rather than “diplomatic
processes to strengthen the treaty regimes or build wider multilateral consensus
against proliferation”.

182.  Mr Tim Dowse, Head of FCO Counter-Proliferation Department in 2002, told the
Inquiry that, in a paper on counter-proliferation strategy produced in July/August 2002,
Iraq was viewed as a priority because it might be “the exception to the broader rule that
WMD programmes are generally acquired for defensive purposes”.85
183.  Mr Dowse added that it had been the political context which made Iraq a priority.
184.  In a subsequent private hearing, Sir William Ehrman, FCO Director International
Security in 2002, told the Inquiry that the paper, approved by Mr Blair in August
2002, stated:
“In country programme terms, our top CP [counter-proliferation] priorities are:
“Iraq – because its WMD may be the exception to the rule that such programmes
are usually driven by defensive needs and, more importantly, are the most likely
to be deployed against UK forces and those of our allies.”86
185.  Asked if the “threat from WMD from Iraq” would have continued to be contained
if sanctions had been maintained, Mr Dowse told the Inquiry:
“… the nuclear threat would have been contained and there would have been
constraints on his other activities, although we believed he was making progress
with missiles, with chemical and biological weapons, despite the constraints.
“The problem was … we did not have high confidence that the sanctions regime
would be maintained …”87

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

187.  In response to a request from Sir Michael Jay, Mr John Williams provided advice
on a media strategy for Iraq on 4 September.88
188.  Mr Williams advised that there was a lot to be done, but it could be done “with
simple arguments and plain language”. Mr Blair’s press conference had shown that
the media landscape could be changed “in a way that separates the hard core critics
from the doubters who are open to persuasion”. The key would be to “put the burden
of the argument on to Iraq and on the critics”:
“Detailed facts will be necessary but not enough.
“We should make the case with conviction … The tone … should reflect difficult
choices, which on balance leave us no alternative but to protect the peace and
stability we have come to take for granted … The public … needs to feel it shares
a sense of reaching a point where minds have to be made up … In the end, it will
come down to an appeal for the public’s trust that the Prime Minister has got a big
judgement right in circumstances where there is no easy answer.”
189.  The means of dealing with Iraq were “not yet decided”.
190.  Mr Williams set out the elements of a possible argument:

•	
•	

The Iraqi regime was a “uniquely dangerous example” of a threat to peace.

•	

The “harsh facts have to be faced, and addressed, whether or not we are able
to deal with the threat by asserting the authority of the United Nations, whether
or not military force becomes necessary”.

•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein’s record was “a challenge to the whole international
community”.

The threat would not go away, it would “become more dangerous”.
The events of 11 September 2001 had shown that distant threats could not
safely be ignored.
Saddam Hussein had in the past provided a safe haven for terrorists.

191.  There was a “need to stress the general threat Iraq poses to international peace
and stability, as well as the direct and specific threat of its WMD being used against
us”. Mr Williams also cited Saddam Hussein’s human rights abuses.
192.  Mr Williams stated that the “evidence dossier” was:
“… unlikely to be enough by itself to win the argument: it will convince persuadable
opinion only if launched in the right environment, framed by a broad case that
establishes Iraq as a threat to international peace and security. There is no ‘killer
fact’ in the dossier which ‘proves’ that Saddam must be taken on now, or this or that
weapon will be used against us.

Minute Williams [John] to PS/PUS [FCO], 4 September 2002, ‘Iraq Media Strategy’.

148

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

“But it does make a convincing case that Iraq has been trying to recruit people for a
nuclear weapons programme and to acquire materials usable in such a programme;
and that it has been trying to extend the range of some missiles in breach of Security
Council resolutions. These are too deeply buried … there is too long a prologue
on what was happening before the inspectors were withdrawn. The dossier should
either be re-structured, and perhaps pared down, or have an executive summary.”
193.  Mr Williams warned that the exercise would be “counter-productive” if the media
was allowed to “trap” the Government “into having to provide ‘proof’ to Appeal Court
standards”. The focus should be on an audience that knew we could not have “certain
knowledge of what is going on inside a closed tyranny”, but would:
“… take seriously a careful assessment which avoids over-statement and appeals
to people to trust the judgement of those taking the decisions … understand that
intelligence is partial, dangerous to acquire and limited in what it is safe to put out
in public. If the dossier is judged by these … standards it will be worth doing.”
194.  Mr Williams also addressed the possible timing of publication depending on
whether “the UN route” was agreed, and the need for a longer-term strategy for Iraq.
He concluded that Mr Blair’s press conference had already had an impact, with a Sky
poll showing “48 percent favour military action, with 52 percent against”. This suggested
that public opinion was more fluid than the critics believed.

Mr Campbell’s meeting, 5 September 2002
195.  Sir David Manning commissioned Sir Richard Dearlove to examine whether
SIS had material for inclusion in the dossier.
196.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Hutton Inquiry that Sir David Manning had
telephoned him on the morning of 4 September and they had:
“… discussed … to what extent it would be possible to put intelligence from my
service into the public domain; and I said that I thought it would be possible … but
I would insist on grounds of source protection on having the last word in withholding
material from publication, if necessary.”89
197.  In a discussion on 5 September, Sir Richard Dearlove told Mr Straw that SIS had
new material for which the sourcing was “strong but indirect” which might be used in
the dossier. There might also be a “significant increase of relevant intelligence” before
publication of the dossier on 25 September.90
198.  Sir Richard also told Mr Straw that the draft dossier “was weakened by the JIC
doctrinaire approach to its drafting”. It would be “better if SIS made its own in-house
judgements on the release of material from sources”. SIS had established a team that

was working on the text, which would be speaking to Mr Scarlett about the re-draft
(of the dossier) on 6 September.
199.  Sir Richard Dearlove agreed that Mr Straw could tell Mr Campbell about the
SIS drafting exercise.
200.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Straw told him on 5 September that
he had seen Sir Richard, who “had agreed to go through all the relevant material
[for the dossier]”.91
201.  Asked what his comment about the draft being weakened by the JIC’s doctrinaire
approach had meant, Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry:
“Good question. I mean, the answer is I have seen this reference and I’m not sure.
There must be something specific that that refers to. It must be something to do with
material from one of our sources and how it was presented. I’m sorry. I mean, I’m
sure if you searched long and hard enough in SIS records, we could turn it up, but
it would be difficult, I think. I’m really not sure what that is.”92
202.  A revised structure for the dossier was agreed at a meeting chaired by
Mr Campbell on 5 September, which also decided that Mr Scarlett and Mr Miller
would lead the work.
203.  Mr McKane wrote to Mr Campbell on 4 September with suggestions for the agenda
of the meeting to be chaired by Mr Campbell the next day “to discuss how to take
forward” Mr Blair’s decision to publish the dossier.93
204.  The suggested agenda comprised:
“•	 Timetable for publication

•	
•	

The shape of the Dossier – ie should all three chapters be published together?

•	

Press lines to be used in connection with the IISS report to be published
on Monday 9 September …”

Arrangements for allowing the US Government the opportunity to comment
on our documents

205.  Mr McKane wrote that he was sending Mr Campbell “the latest version of the
Dossier – though John Scarlett’s people are doing further work on the WMD chapter”.
Mr Campbell had already been sent the “first draft of a capping piece to answer the
question: ‘Why Now?’”

206.  The version of the dossier sent to Mr Campbell was the 20 June draft of the
dossier sent to Sir David Manning and others, including Mr Campbell, on 21 June; it
did not include the later draft of the WMD paper produced by Mr Scarlett in mid-August.
207.  Mr Campbell’s meeting on 5 September was attended by Sir David Manning,
Mr Scarlett, Mr Miller, Mr McKane, Mr Desmond Bowen, who was about to
succeed Mr McKane, Mr Wright, Mr Chaplin, Mr John Williams and Mr Paul Hamill,
Communication and Information Centre (CIC).94
208.  Reporting the outcome of the meeting to Mr Powell, Mr Campbell wrote:

•	
•	
•	

There would be a “substantial rewrite” with Mr Scarlett and Mr Miller “in charge”.

•	

Mr Scarlett would take the draft to the US on Friday 13 September.95

The structure would be “as per TB’s [Mr Blair’s] discussion”.
It had been agreed that there had to be “real intelligence material” in the
document.

209.  Commenting on the meeting, Mr Campbell wrote that the dossier:
“… had to be revelatory and we needed to show that it was new and informative and
part of a bigger case. John Williams … was offering to write it full time. John Scarlett
was clearly aware of the responsibility, he was so serious … He warned us that
there was very little re nuclear.”96
210.  Following the meeting, Mr Miller recorded the agreement on a revised structure
for the dossier, and who would be responsible for action on each of the seven sections:
“•	 Section 1: Background to the bloody nature of Saddam’s regime. How he gained
and retains power. [Action: FCO/MED]

•	
•	

Section 2: Saddam’s use of power … Human rights abuses. [Action: FCO/MED]

•	

Section 4: Effects of using WMD and ballistic missiles. Why the international
community was right to be concerned then and why we are still concerned now.
[Action: Assessments Staff]

•	

Section 3: Short link section covering the international community’s demand to
dismantle Iraq’s WMD capability … to ensure Iraq’s regional ambitions did not
cause further instability. [Action: Assessments Staff]

Section 5: The history of UN weapons inspections. What UNSCOM found? What
the Iraqi’s [sic] subsequently admitted. History of concealment and obstruction
(including the withdrawal of UNSCOM and the failure to co-operate with
UNMOVIC. What remains unaccounted for? [Action: Assessments Staff]

•	

Section 6: What is the current situation concerning Iraq’s WMD programmes?
Account of his … capabilities. New procurement activity and retention of
experts. Use of illicit funding and circumvention of ‘Oil-for-Food’ arrangements.
What is the threat posed by Iraq’s on-going WMD programmes? [Action:

Section 7: Why we cannot continue to rely on containment and why we should
act now. Future intentions. [Action: FCO/MED]”97

211.  Mr Miller wrote that much of the work was seen as “cutting and pasting” existing
material, and that the Communications and Information Centre (CIC) had “offered to …
co-ordinate the various inputs and produce a revised draft of the dossier”. That would
be discussed at a meeting on 10 September.
212.  Mr Sebastian Wood, Counsellor, British Embassy Washington, wrote that
Mr Scarlett had told him:

•	
•	

Mr Blair wanted the paper on “what Saddam has been doing since 1998 and
how we currently assess his WMD programmes” to be “as intelligence-rich and
convincing in detail as possible”, and Mr Scarlett expected to be “able to ‘break
out’ some current intelligence”.
Mr Scarlett would come to Washington with a draft and Sir David Manning
wanted the Embassy to tell the US that Mr Scarlett had been “designated”
by Mr Blair to take the dossier forward”.98

213.  Mr Williams suggested revising the “capping piece” for the draft dossier.
214.  On 5 September, Mr Williams sent Mr McKane a revised version of the draft
capping piece for the dossier, which he described as offering “suggestions” on how it
might be amended to “make the document easier for Ministers to defend in interviews”.99
215.  Mr Williams’ changes included reference to Saddam Hussein’s regime being
“uniquely” dangerous and that it had a “capacity for aggression”. He also described
the material in the dossier as “our best publishable assessment” of the facts.
216.  Mr McKane told the Inquiry that his only recollection of an exchange with
Mr Williams on the dossier was of his comments on the draft capping note “which were
designed … to improve the draft and make … it read better”.100
217.  Mr McKane stated that his draft was “overtaken by the decision to move
responsibility” for the dossier, from OD Sec to the Assessments Staff when it was
decided that it would be “more overtly an intelligence-based document”.101

218.  Mr Williams produced a draft executive summary for the dossier over
the weekend of 7 to 8 September.
219.  Mr Williams wrote to Mr Campbell on 6 September saying that he had spoken
to Mr Straw and Sir Michael Jay about the “the media-friendly editorial job that will need
to be done when John Scarlett and his team have produced the dossier”.102 They were
“happy” for him “to devote whatever time necessary” to work on the draft and he would
be able to work full time on it (from the week beginning 16 September).
220.  Mr Williams added that it would, in his view, “be good for the Foreign Office if
we could do it that way”. He also offered a press officer with a “very good eye for the
kind of material which works with the media”, to work with Mr Scarlett and his team
“on producing the right kind of material”.
221.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Williams wrote that at Mr Campbell’s meeting
on 5 September:
“It was clear that no decision had been taken about who would produce the dossier.
John Scarlett said that intelligence had no experience of writing documents for
publication and would need the help of a ‘golden pen’. He turned to me. Alastair
Campbell did not take this up. At the end of the meeting I asked Alastair what
his intention was. He said he was inclined to give the task to the No.10 Strategic
Communications Unit.
“When I reported this … to the Foreign Secretary and Michael Jay, they were clear
that the dossier must be produced by the Foreign Office, not No.10, and I should
be the ‘golden pen’.”103
222.  Mr Williams added that he was “still sceptical of the whole idea”, but the “dossier
was going to happen”. He was about to accompany Mr Straw to the UN General
Assembly in New York, so he asked Mr Scarlett:
“… if he would like to give me the material he intended to use, so that I could show
him how to produce it in publishable form. I did this over the weekend. It was a
routine job of taking the strongest points and putting them in an executive summary,
while taking care to reflect their content accurately, and introducing them with the
sort of language that was familiar from speeches and interviews given by … [Mr Blair
and Mr Straw].”
223.  Mr Williams stated that the “result was underwhelming”, that there was “nothing
much new”, and that his “feeling that this was not a good idea persisted”.104 He had
been “relieved” when he heard that No.10 had decided that Mr Scarlett would write
the dossier.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

224.  The document which Mr Williams produced was released by the FCO in February
2008 in response to a Freedom of Information request.105
225.  Mr Williams told the Inquiry:
“Some journalists have detected similarity between the shape of my effort and the
finished product, but it would have been surprising if an organisation which had never
produced a public document [had] not taken some pointers from a professional.”106
226.  Following Mr Campbell’s meeting on 5 September, four drafts of the dossier
were prepared and circulated for comment to JIC members and other officials in the
FCO, the MOD, the Cabinet Office and the Intelligence Agencies, on 10, 16, 19 and
20 September. Each is addressed later in this Section.

Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, Camp David,
7 September 2002
227.  In a press conference before the discussions at Camp David Mr Blair stated
that Iraq had to be dealt with. The purpose of the meeting with President Bush
was to work out the strategy.
228.  Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David on 7 September, and
the press conference which preceded the meeting, are addressed in Section 3.4.
229.  In the press conference, Mr Blair stated:
“The point I would emphasise … is the threat from Saddam Hussein and weapons
of mass destruction, chemical, biological, potentially nuclear weapons capability,
that threat is real. We only need to look at the report from the International
Atomic [Energy] Agency this morning107 showing what has been going on at the
former nuclear site to realise that. And the policy of inaction is not a policy we can
responsibly subscribe to. So the purpose of our discussion today is to work out the
right strategy for dealing with this, because deal with it we must.”108
230.  In response to a question, Mr Blair emphasised concern about Iraq’s attempts
to develop nuclear weapons and the importance of the IAEA report he had mentioned
which showed there was “a real issue that has to be tackled here”. He stated that, on the
way to Camp David, he had been reading “the catalogue of attempts by Iraq to conceal
its weapons of mass destruction, not to tell the truth … over a period of years”.

The IAEA issued a press release (IAEA Press Release 2002/11) on 6 September 2002 stating: “With
reference to an article published today in the New York Times, the International Atomic Energy Agency
would like to state that it has no new information on Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme since 1998 when
its inspectors left Iraq. Only through a resumption of inspection … can the Agency draw any conclusion
with regard to Iraq’s compliance with its obligations … relating to its nuclear activities.”

231.  Asked about international support, Mr Blair replied that:
“… people were asking perfectly reasonable questions … but the one thing no one
can deny is that Saddam Hussein is in breach of the United Nations resolutions
on weapons of mass destruction … that that poses a threat not just to the region,
because there is no way, if those weapons are used, that the threat would simply
stay in the region.
“People understand that. Now we have got to make sure that we work out a way
forward that, of course, mobilises the maximum support, but does so on the basis
of removing a threat that the United Nations itself has determined is a threat to the
whole world.”
232.  The British journalists covering the Camp David meeting focused on the
WMD dossier.
233.  The Sunday Express anticipated a “Dossier of Doom”.109
234.  An editorial in the News of the World claimed that the dossier would be “as
devastating as it is vital”. It would show that “evil Saddam has enough chemical and
biological stocks to attack the entire planet, and the missile technology to deliver them”.
It would confirm that he is on the brink of nuclear capability. The editorial concluded:
“We believe Mr Blair CAN convince us a military attack on Iraq is right. We have faith
in our Prime Minister.”110
235.  In their meeting, Mr Blair told President Bush that he was in no doubt about
the need to deal with Saddam Hussein.
236.  Mr Blair also set out the need to build a case to persuade the international
community of the threat posed by Iraq, including the potential for fusion of WMD
and terrorism.
237.  During the discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair set out the need to make a
good public case against Saddam Hussein, publishing all the evidence. The UK would
publish a dossier. He stated that the US and UK:
“… must build our case, persuading the international community of the nature of the
threat. In particular we must get over to our publics the reality that any crisis in the
Gulf generated by Saddam would inevitably involve us.”111
238.  Later Mr Blair stated that there was a need to explain the case for action fully to
public opinion: “While insisting that no-one wanted war, we must spell out why we had
to act.” That included reminding people of the horrors of Saddam Hussein’s regime.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

239.  Mr Blair said there was a:
“… natural reluctance to do difficult things, made worse by ignorance … of Saddam’s
capabilities and intentions. We had to correct this, at the same time answering the
legitimate question of why we were taking action now. 11 September [2001] was a
powerful argument for dealing with threats before they materialised … At some point,
WMD and terrorism would come together, with appalling consequences, unless we
took action.”
240.  A plenary meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair and their teams followed
the restricted discussion.112
241.  Presentational issues were discussed between officials and in the plenary,
including the “Why now?” question.
242.  Mr Blair stated that since 1998, there was evidence, including in the 6 September
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report (see previous comment), of continued
development of WMD. He also thought that the nature of the Iraqi regime “should
become part of our case on WMD”; and that: “We needed an active strategy to take the
debate to the rest of the world.” He set out the UK’s plans to publish the dossier within
a few weeks.
243.  Mr Campbell emphasised the need for people “to understand what BW actually
did”; and that the “media threshold would be high, so the dossier would need to include
new facts from the last four years”.

JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002
244.  On 9 September, the JIC issued an Assessment of Iraq’s possession
of chemical and biological weapons and possible scenarios for their use.
245.  The Assessment contained a number of significant changes which
strengthened previous JIC judgements on Iraq’s possession of chemical
and biological weapons and the likelihood of their use.
246.  In response to the request from Sir David Manning for advice on the possible
scenarios for Iraqi use of chemical and biological weapons, the JIC commissioned
an Assessment.113
247.  The Assessment was discussed in “an informal CIG [Current Intelligence Group]
of experts” and then considered by the JIC on 4 September.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

248.  A number of key points were made in the JIC discussion:

•	

•	

•	

•	
•	
•	

“Once finalised it [the Assessment] would be of immense interest to Ministers
and officials, and would help to underline the importance and seriousness of the
threat Iraq posed with these weapons. The fact that Saddam Hussein possessed
these capabilities, and that he showed every sign of being prepared to use them,
was significant.”
“Another important message, which needed to be brought out more clearly
in the draft, was that if the chips were down, and Saddam believed his regime
to be under real threat of extinction, nothing was going to deter him from using
such weapons. Readers of the paper needed to be reminded of Saddam’s
unpredictability, and of the fact that his thought processes did not work
in a recognisably Western rational and logical way.”
“The draft should also distinguish more clearly between the three different
ways in which Iraq might use its offensive chemical or biological capabilities: in
weaponised form against military targets; in an unconventional attack on military
targets; or as part of a sponsored terrorist attack aimed at spreading fear and
influencing public attitudes”.
“[S]ince the draft had been written and circulated, an important and valuable
supply of new intelligence had been received, from a variety of sources, judged
by the producers to be reliable and authoritative. The draft needed to … include
this intelligence with an expert assessment of its significance.”
“It [the Assessment] also needed to be clearer which of its judgements were
based on firm intelligence, which were based more on informed assessment
or interpretation, and where the major gaps in the UK’s knowledge and
understanding of Iraq’s capabilities remained.”
“It was possible that further insights from intelligence would be forthcoming
in the relatively near future. These might not only inform any future Assessments
but might also need to be reflected somehow in the dossier on Iraq’s weapons
of mass destruction programmes that was being prepared for publication.”

249.  Mr Scarlett proposed that the paper should be revised to reflect the discussion and
then reviewed “at working level by the relevant experts”. Once that was done, the paper
would be issued in its final form.
250.  The Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment of 9 September stated:
“•	 Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared
to use it.

•	
•	

Faced with the likelihood of military defeat and being removed from power,
Saddam is unlikely to be deterred from using chemical and biological weapons
by any diplomatic or military means.
The use of chemical and biological weapons prior to any military attack would
boost support for US-led action and is unlikely.
157

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	

Saddam is prepared to order missile strikes against Israel, with chemical
or biological warheads, in order to widen the war once hostilities begin.
Saddam could order the use of CBW weapons in order to deny space and
territory to Coalition Forces, or to cause casualties, slow any advance, and sap
US morale.
If not previously employed, Saddam will order the indiscriminate use of whatever
CBW weapons remain available late in a ground campaign or as a final act
of vengeance. But such an order would depend on the availability of delivery
means and the willingness of commanders to obey.”114

251.  The Assessment stated that it had taken “account of new intelligence that has
recently become available on Iraq’s intentions”. Unusually, it stated explicitly that it had
“an intelligence cut off point of 4 September”.
252.  To provide context, the Introduction to the Assessment stated:
“Recent intelligence casts light on Iraq’s holdings of weapons of mass destruction
and on its doctrine for using them. Intelligence remains limited and Saddam’s own
unpredictability complicates judgements about Iraqi use of these weapons. Much
of this paper is necessarily based on judgement and assessment.”
253.  The JIC added:
“Iraq used chemical weapons on a large scale during the Iran/Iraq War. Use on the
same scale now would require large quantities of chemical weapons and survivable
delivery means in the face of overwhelming US air superiority. Iraq did not use
chemical weapons during the [1991] Gulf War. Intelligence suggests that Iraq may
have used the biological agent, aflatoxin, against the Shia population in 1991. We
do not believe that Iraq possesses nuclear weapons and there is no intelligence that
Iraq is currently interested in radiological dispersal devices.”
254.  Other key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.

JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002: ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical
and Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios’
Chemical and biological capabilities
“Based on intelligence on the nature of Iraqi CBW weapons, known delivery means,
continuing procurement activity, and experience from previous conflicts”, the JIC judged:

•	

Iraq currently had available “either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent
production, a number of biological warfare (BW) and chemical warfare (CW)
agents and weapons”.

Possible Scenarios’.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•	

“following a decision to do so, Iraq could produce significant quantities of
mustard agent within weeks … [and] the nerve agents sarin and VX within
months (and in the case of VX … may have already done so)”.

•	

Production of VX and sarin would be “heavily dependent on hidden stocks of
precursors, the size of which are unknown”.

•	
•	

Iraq could produce “more biological agents within days”.

•	

Even if stocks of weapons were “limited”, that would “allow for focused strikes
against key military targets or for strategic purposes (such as a strike against
Israel or Kuwait)”.

•	

Iraq “could deliver CW and BW agents by a variety of means including free fall
bombs, airborne sprays, artillery shells, mortar bombs and battlefield rockets”.

•	

Iraq had told UNSCOM that it had “filled 25 warheads with anthrax, botulinum
toxin and aflatoxin” for the Al Hussein missile and “developed 50 chemical
warheads” for the missile.

•	
•	

Iraq retained “up to 20 Al Hussein and a limited number of launchers”.

•	

“an emergency operational capability with conventional warheads” was “probably
available” for the Al Samoud and Ababil-100 short-range ballistic missiles.

•	

“Iraq may have other toxins, chemical and biological agents we do not
know about”.

•	

“the effectiveness of any CBW attack would depend on the method of delivery,
concentration of the target, dissemination efficiency, meteorological conditions
and the availability of suitable defensive counter measures”.

“the commencement of large-scale production of chemical and biological agents
would probably go undetected, and a decision to do so may already have been
taken. The location of production facilities is unknown.”

“One intelligence report suggests that Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop
warheads capable of disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it
would take six months to overcome the ‘technical difficulties’”.

“Other recent intelligence” indicated that:
“•	

production of chemical and biological weapons is taking place;

•	

Saddam attaches great importance to having CBW, is committed to using
CBW if he can and is aware of the implications of doing so. Saddam wants
it to dominate his neighbours and deter his enemies who he considers are
unimpressed by his weakened conventional military capability;

•	

Iraq has learned from the Gulf War the importance of mobile systems that are
much harder to hit than static sites. Consequently Iraq has developed for the
military, fermentation systems which are capable of being mounted on roadtrailers or rail cars. These could produce BW agent;

•	

Iraq has probably dispersed its special weapons, including its CBW weapons.
Intelligence also indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be with
military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.”

Intentions for use
“Intelligence indicates that Saddam has already taken the decision that all resources,
including CBW, be used to defend the regime from attack. One report states that Saddam

159

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

would not use CBW during the initial air phase of any military campaign, but would use
CBW once a ground invasion of Iraq has begun. Faced with the likelihood of military
defeat and being removed from power, we judge that it is unlikely there would be a way
to deter Saddam from using CBW.”
The JIC judged that “several factors could influence the timing of a decision …
to authorise the use of CBW weapons”:
“•	

the availability of stocks of CW and BW agents;

•	

the survivability of … delivery means … Once a military campaign is under way
the pressure will increase to use certain assets before they are destroyed;

•	

the survivability of command and control mechanisms … Intelligence indicates
that Saddam’s son Qusay may already have been given authority to order the
use of CBW … Saddam may … specify in advance … the specific conditions in
which unit commanders should use these weapons e.g. once Coalition Forces
have crossed a particular geographical line;

•	

the reliability of the units … Late in any campaign commanders may not be
prepared to use CBW if they judge that Saddam is about to fall.”

The JIC also examined possible scenarios for the use of CBW weapons.

•	

Before a conflict – The JIC stated that the aim “would be to incapacitate
or kill Coalition troops in their concentration areas. Intelligence indicates that
… Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Israel and Kuwait” had been identified as targets.
“Turkey could also be at risk. Both chemical and biological weapons could be
used … But the use of CBW weapons carries serious risks and Saddam will
weigh up their military utility against the political costs. Use … would expose the
lies and deception … The early, widespread use of CBW or non-lethal agents
would affect Coalition military planning … On balance however we judge that the
political costs of using CBW weapons would outweigh the military advantages
and that Saddam would probably not use CBW … pre-emptively.”

•	

During the ground phase – “There is no intelligence on specific Iraqi plans
for how CBW would be used in a conflict. Large numbers of chemical munitions
would need to be used to make a battlefield impact. BW could also be used
although it is less effective as a tactical weapon … But the use of even small
quantities of chemical weapons would cause significant degradation in Coalition
progress and might contribute to redressing Coalition conventional superiority
… Iraq could make effective use of persistent chemical agents to shape the
battlefield … by denying space and territory to Coalition Forces. Booby-traps
and improvised explosive devices could be used … to inflict local losses in urban
areas. It is also possible that Saddam would seek to use chemical and biological
munitions against any internal uprising; intelligence indicates that he is prepared
to deliberately target the Shia population. One report indicates that he would be
more likely to use CBW against Western forces than on Arab countries.”

•	

Drawing Israel into the conflict – “… One intelligence report suggests that if
Saddam were to use CBW, his first target would be Israel. Another … suggests
that Iraq believes Israel will respond with nuclear weapons if attacked with CBW
or conventional warheads. It is not clear if Saddam is deterred by this threat or
judges it to be unlikely in the face of US pressure on Israel not to take such a
course of action.”

•	

Unconventional use of CBW – “Although there is no intelligence to indicate
Iraq has considered using chemical and biological agents in terrorist attacks,
we cannot rule out the possibility. […] Saddam could also remove his existing
constraints on dealing with Al Qaida … Intelligence indicates that Saddam
has specifically commissioned a team of scientists to devise novel means of
deploying CBW.”

•	

“At the death” – “In the last resort Saddam is likely to order the indiscriminate
use of whatever chemical and biological weapons remain available to him, in a
last attempt to cling on to power or to cause as much damage as possible in a
final act of vengeance. If he has not already done so by this stage Saddam will
launch CBW attacks on Israel. Implementation of such orders would depend on
the delivery means still available, the survivability of the command chain and the
willingness of commanders to obey.”

255.  The JIC acknowledged that much of the Assessment was “necessarily based
on judgement and assessment”.
256.  The Butler Report highlighted that the new judgements relied heavily
on inferences made by the JIC in its assessment of recently received
intelligence reports.
257.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the Key Judgements in a JIC Assessment:
“… represent the formal view of the JIC on the central questions which are being
considered in the Assessment itself. They are not a summary of the main points
in the text. They are a bringing together and drawing on existing JIC Assessments,
a wide body of information which may be outside, much of it open source, secret
intelligence, in addition, and other relevant factors, such as past behaviour, past
actions and so on.”115
258.  In response to the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report in February
2004, the Government stated that the purpose of the Key Judgements section of
JIC Assessments was “to highlight the judgements to be drawn from the intelligence
assessed”; it was “not intended to be a summary of the main facts in the paper”.116
259.  The Butler Report stated that the JIC Assessment of 9 September “was prepared
in parallel with the Assessment of 21 August”, and that:
“Its tone was set by its first Key Judgement, which reflected a significant
change from previous JIC judgements on Iraqi possession of chemical and
biological weapons.”117

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

260.  The first Key Judgement stated:
“Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared
to use it.”
261.  The Butler Report commented:
“The JIC made clear that much of the [9 September] Assessment was based on its
own judgement, drawing on the work done for its Assessment of 21 August. But we
were struck by the relative thinness of the intelligence base supporting the greater
firmness of the JIC’s judgements on Iraqi production and possession of chemical
and biological weapons, especially the inferential nature of much of it.”118
262.  Sir John Scarlett explained to the Inquiry that the “relationship between collection,
dissemination, comment, analysis, assessment and then policy-making was a subtle
one”.119 Intelligence reports were issued by the collection agency and there was the
possibility for that agency “to make a comment on the report and very often put it into
context compared with what other reports have said on a given subject”. Reports were
then issued to customers across government “particularly … in the Defence Intelligence
Staff who are … an important body of analysts”. Those customers played a role in the
Current Intelligence Groups, but it was the job of the Assessments Staff to bring it all
together into a “big picture assessment”.
263.  Sir John Scarlett stated that the 9 September Assessment had a “separate
judgement on the capabilities which existed”; and that it was not intended to be a worst
case scenario. The change was the firm judgement on Iraq’s current possession of
agents and weapons which:
“… referred to recent intelligence on the production of weapons now taking
place, the development of mobile systems and then, importantly, on the regime
and Saddam’s intent. The great importance that he attached to the possession
of chemical and biological weapons and his readiness to use them if necessary,
including to defend the regime from attack.
“He saw possession as a central feature of his regional power position and
continued ability to project influence.
“That intelligence on intent was significant – taken to be significant.
“It was also noted that we did not know specific plans for CBW use in the event
of conflict, the location of production facilities, the size of stocks.”120

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

264.  Addressing the judgements that had been reached, Sir John Scarlett stated that
it was “not at all unusual for an intelligence base behind judgments to be limited or
described as sporadic and patchy”. The intelligence received in September was:
“… judged against a set of standing judgments from the past which I’d been at pains
to point out were already quite strong …”121
265.  Sir John subsequently stated: “We thought there was a sound intelligence base,
and we had a firm judgment. That’s the point I want to make.”122
266.  Mr Miller added:
“The discussion on 4 September at the JIC really was one that gelled with the very
firm view amongst the community about both the possession and the readiness to
use, on Saddam’s part, these weapons.
“We went away, in the light of that discussion, and wrote the paper which is the final
Assessment and expressed those views really quite specifically and as very firm
judgments which did, I think, pin down the view of the JIC community at that point.
It was the moment which sticks with me as being quite an important one in terms of
the arrival of new intelligence, and the precipitation of a discussion in the JIC which
led to a very firm expression of the judgments it had reached on both possession
and intent.”
267.  In response to a question about the categorical nature of the Key Judgements
in comparison with the detailed text in the 9 September Assessment, Sir John Scarlett
emphasised the importance of the distinction to be drawn between the strength of the
intelligence base on which an Assessment drew and the firmness of the JIC’s Key
Judgements; and that the JIC had, in September 2002, made “quite firm judgements”
despite the limitations in the intelligence.123
268.  Mr Miller told the Inquiry that the document discussed by the JIC on 4 September:
“… wasn’t a full JIC Assessment, and it was full of … caveated language …
“In the discussion, the point was made by one of the JIC members that at this stage
we should, as a Committee, be very clear on what we were telling Ministers, and
there was a view expressed in terms that, despite the caveats in the document
prepared by the Assessment Staff, the view was that Saddam did possess the
weapons and would be ready to use them, and that was the view that was shared
around the JIC table, and which the JIC specifically wanted set out in those terms
as the advice that Ministers should read from their intelligence committee.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“So you are absolutely right to distinguish between the body of the paper and
the judgements, but it is a distinction which was made consciously and with
deliberation.”124
269.  Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the 9 September Assessment “stayed in
place as the confirmed view of the JIC in the months that followed and it didn’t change
significantly”.125
270.  The Assessments Staff and most members of the JIC were not aware at the
time of the details of the sourcing chains and that little of the information provided
by “reliable sources” was based on first-hand knowledge.
271.  In the context of comments on the intelligence underpinning the judgements
in the Assessment of 9 September, the Butler Report stated:
“… the JIC did not reflect in its Assessment, even if only to dismiss it, material in
one of those reports suggesting that most members of the Iraqi leadership were not
convinced that it would be possible to use chemical and biological weapons.”126
272.  Commenting on the Assessment, the Butler Review concluded that:
“By mid-September 2002, therefore, readers of JIC assessments will have had
an impression of continuity with, but also some change from, the JIC assessment
of 15 March:
a.	 The continuing clear strategic intent on the part of the Iraqi regime to pursue
its nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile programmes.
b.	 Continuing efforts by the Iraqi regime to sustain and where possible develop
its indigenous capabilities.
c.	 The apparent considerable development, drawing on these capabilities, of
Iraq’s ‘break-out’ potential. Although Iraq’s nuclear programme continued to be
constrained, there was strong evidence of continuing work on ballistic missiles,
including the development and production of systems with ranges in excess
of limits set by the United Nations. There was also evidence from one source,
supported by one complementary report, of Iraq having the ability to produce
biological agent in mobile facilities, and additional evidence of activity at one
site formerly associated with Iraq’s biological warfare programme. Finally, there
were recent intelligence reports, albeit mainly inferential, that Iraq was producing
chemical agent. For analysts, intelligence on Iraqi production of biological
and chemical agent would have been put alongside Iraq’s proven ability to
weaponise agent onto at least some delivery systems, and separate intelligence

reports on Saddam Hussein’s intention to use chemical and biological weapons
if attacked.”127
273.  The Butler Report stated that the “more definite judgements inside the
Assessment” were based on:
“… significant new intelligence in August and September 2002 … Four reports were
received in total, from three sources, which were influential … The first provided
material from a range of original informants reporting via an intermediary to the
source.128 We have noted, however, that the individual items from the informants did
not confirm directly that Iraq had chemical weapons. They came from senior Iraqi
officials who were believed at the time to have direct knowledge of Iraq’s intentions,
use, deployment or concealment of chemical weapons, but were based for most
of the informants on an assumption (not direct knowledge) that Iraq had such
weapons.”129
274.  The Butler Report added:
“The second and third [reports] were from a source who had previously reported
reliably and who continued to do so in the following months. This source, too, could
not confirm from direct experience that Iraq had chemical weapons, resting on
reporting ‘common knowledge’ within his circle that chemical agent production was
taking place. The second report from this source seems to us to duplicate much
of the first.”130
275.  The fourth intelligence report described in the Butler Report:
“… was a single report, from a reliable and established source reporting a
new subsource who did not subsequently provide any further reporting, which
was described as ‘confirming’ the intelligence on Iraqi mobile biological agent
production facilities received from the liaison service. Contrary to the JIC view at
the time, we believe that this report would have been more accurately described
as ‘complementary’ to, rather than ‘confirming’, it.”131
276.  Mr Miller told the Inquiry that the intelligence reports were from:

•	

“one established and reliable source, which was quoting senior Iraqi officers,
[…], about the use of CBW”;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

“another one of the very well established sources […] about the determination
of the Iraqi regime to have CBW capable missiles, and the reliance on those
weapons as being a contributor or an important part of the ability to project
power in the region, to establish Iraq as a regional power”; and
“a reliable source”, “about the use of CBW against the Shia population
internally”.132

277.  Mr Miller added:
“So there was a body of reporting by September that was talking not about technical
details of production, but about an understanding that these weapons were
available, and that there was a clear place for them in Iraq’s thinking about how
to conduct itself and how to maintain regional influence.”
278.  Mr Miller concluded:
“As the Assessment said, the intelligence was patchy. It was sporadic. It didn’t flow
through in great volumes routinely, particularly prior to the summer of 2002. But I think
the sense of the community was that yes, we are not getting a full picture, but we
are getting here a pretty consistent picture, even if it is a rather patchy one, sufficient
to inform these judgements, but certainly as additional intelligence came through
in the course of 2002, the sense was that that did then begin to provide a weightier
basis for reaching the conclusions that were set out in September.”133
279.  Asked about the sources, their background and reliability and whether they were
providing hearsay evidence, Mr Miller explained:
“There were different sources. In the Assessment Staff we didn’t seek to have
expertise in the sourcing of the intelligence. So we relied on rather summary
accounts of the sourcing given in the reports, which tended to characterise it as new
or established, reliable or not yet proven, and we give some indication of whether
the reporting was direct or indirect.”
280.  Mr Miller told the Inquiry that reporting which influenced the Assessment came
from six new reports, “from apparently solid sources”.134
281.  Sir John Scarlett stated that “at the time, the separation of the different streams
of reporting wasn’t always clear to the Assessment Staff”, and that:
“… with the slight benefit of hindsight, I can say now that essentially we are
talking about three different streams of reporting … which were coming through

in a two-week period at the time the 9 September Assessment was being
prepared and discussed.”135
282.  Sir John stated that:

•	
•	

the source who had produced “the 45-minute report as well”, was “an
established and reliable reporting [source], but reporting from a line of …
named sub-sources”; and
that source “was quoting his knowledge” and had been “speaking in very definite
terms about their continued possession [of chemical and biological weapons]”.136

283.  The “45 Minute” report “quoting the sub-sources on the intention to use [CBW]”
was withdrawn on 28 September 2004 (see Section 4.3).137 Sir John said he had known
“in about May 2004” that there was “a big question mark about that report”.
284.  In relation to the production of biological agent, Sir John Scarlett stated that a
report in early September:
“… from an established and reliable source … referred to a … fermentation system,
which … was judged to be very likely to be a reference to the same general
capability and the same focus on mobile production capabilities, and that was
referred to in assessments after that as corroboration for the mobile reporting.
“So a lot of weight was placed upon the reporting […] from that source.”138
285.  Sir John stated that the reporting on mobile production facilities was withdrawn
on 29 September 2004.139
286.  Mr Miller told the Inquiry:
“… we were the recipients of the intelligence on the basis described and we gave
weight to those descriptions, but we didn’t try to get underneath the surface of what
had led to a conclusion particularly about the reliability of any particular stream.”140
287.  Asked how much the JIC had known about the sources, Mr Miller added:
“Generally not a great deal. From time to time, when there was a particular source
which the agencies attached great weight to, there was some briefing given on why
they were attaching particular weight to a source. But it was all at a fairly high level
of generality, and there was, for the bulk of the reporting, nothing more than the
descriptors on the individual reports.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

288.  Sir John Scarlett added:
“… at that time none of us in the Assessment Staff, including me, knew the details of
this sourcing. Nor were we clear how many lines of reporting there were, and I know
that because just before the conflict I was asking … how many lines of reporting are
we actually talking about? …”141
289.  The withdrawal, in September 2004, of reporting on Iraq intentions for the use
of CBW and earlier reporting on mobile biological production facilities, is addressed
in Section 4.3.

IISS Assessment, 9 September 2002
The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) published a dossier, Iraq’s Weapons
of Mass Destruction: A Net Assessment, on 9 September.142
In his press statement, the Director of the IISS, Dr John Chipman, said that the IISS
objective had been “to assess, as accurately and dispassionately as possible,
Iraq’s current WMD capabilities”.143 The task was challenging: “Iraq made every
effort to obscure its past, obstruct dismantlement of its present assets, and retain
capabilities for the future.”
Other comments made by Dr Chipman included:

•	

UNSCOM’s experience showed that no on-site inspections could succeed
“unless inspectors develop an imaginative and carefully co-ordinated
counter-concealment strategy”.

•	

UNMOVIC would need “time to develop and refine the unique inspection
techniques required” and to develop “considerable field experience to develop
the necessary tradecraft to deal with Iraqi obfuscation efforts”.

•	

The “strength of Baghdad’s commitment to possess WMD” was “measurable in
part by its efforts to resist unfettered UN inspections”.

The IISS dossier identified the differences in view amongst experts as to whether Iraq was
focused on reconstituting its biological and chemical warfare capabilities or was “prepared
to risk detection and re-invest massive resources in pursuit of nuclear weapons”.144 There
was, however, “general agreement” that it was “very unlikely to have achieved the ability
to produce sufficient fissile material for nuclear weapons”. But if Iraq:
“… were able to acquire sufficient fissile material from foreign sources, it could
probably produce nuclear weapons on short order, perhaps in a matter of months.
This is based on the plausible assumption that Iraqi designers, working from
the 1991 baseline, have been able to complete the preparations for building
a nuclear weapon …”

The IISS stated that Iraqi acquisition of fissile material was “not a high probability”,
but “it has to be seen as a real risk that could dramatically and quickly shift the balance
of power”.
The IISS regarded Iraq’s biological weapons programme as “the least understood and
accounted for by 1998”. Iraq could “plausibly” have retained substantial quantities of
growth media and BW agent. It was “not known for certain” whether Iraq had resumed
production of agent, but it seemed “a safe bet that it has, or will, in the face of an
impending attack”.
The IISS judged that, from Baghdad’s perspective, biological weapons presented “Iraq’s
closest approximation to nuclear weapons as an instrument of deterrence or terror”.
But, in practice, “the magnitude of Iraq’s BW threat depends on its delivery capability,
which appears limited”.
The IISS stated, however, that even if Iraq had not advanced the designs for missile
warheads since 1991, and depending on the agent used and a number of ambient factors,
“casualties in an unprotected population could run in the hundreds or even thousands”.
If Iraqi aircraft could survive opposing air forces and air defences, delivery by airborne
spray devices would be “even more deadly”.
The IISS described Iraq’s chemical weapons arsenal as “better known and less
threatening”. It had “probably retained a few hundred tonnes of mustard and enough
stable precursors to produce a few hundred tonnes of sarin/cyclosarin and perhaps a
similar amount of VX”. It could have mobilised production facilities to produce fresh CW
agent, but its current capability probably comprised “hundreds of tonnes of agent … and
perhaps a few thousand munitions”. Before 1991 it had had “thousands of tonnes of agent
and tens of thousands of effective munitions”. Iraq had an ability to “deliver chemical
warheads on its rocket and artillery pieces, as well as aerial bombs”, but its capability
effectively to deliver chemical munitions with missiles or aircraft over longer distances
was “questionable”. Unless Iraq had advanced its pre-1991 designs, its ability efficiently
to disseminate chemical agent with missile warheads was “extremely limited”.
The IISS concluded that Iraq most likely had a small force of ballistic missiles, “perhaps
a dozen or so”, with a range of 650km and capable of delivering CBW warheads.
Finally, the IISS stated:
“As in the past, the threat or use of force may compel Iraq to extend greater
co-operation, but signs of weakness and division in the Security Council are likely
to invite Iraqi backsliding …
“Either course of action carries risks. Wait and the threat will grow. Strike and the
threat may be used …”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Confirmation of Mr Scarlett’s responsibility for producing the dossier
290.  On 9 September, it was confirmed that Mr Scarlett and the Assessments Staff
would be responsible for the production of the Iraq dossier.
291.  After a discussion with Mr Scarlett, Mr Campbell wrote setting out the process
by which the dossier would be produced:
“The first point is that this must be, and be seen to be, the work of you and your
team, and that its credibility depends fundamentally on that.
“The second is that you are working on a new dossier, according to the structure
we agreed at the meeting last week, to meet the new circumstances which have
developed over recent weeks and months. Therefore, the rush of comments on the
old dossier are not necessary or totally relevant. People should wait for the new one
which will be more detailed and substantial.”145
292.  Mr Campbell wrote that the structure agreed the previous week was “roughly”:
“•	 why the issue arose in the first place

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

why the inspection process was necessary

•	
•	
•	

illicit money

the history of concealment and deception
the story of inspectors, leading to their departure
the story of weapons unaccounted for, and what they could do
a section on ballistic missile technology
CW/BW
nuclear
the sanctions regime, and how the policy of containment has worked only
up to a point
the repressive nature of the regime
why the history … makes us worried he cannot be allowed further to develop
these weapons.”

293.  Much of the content of the dossier would be “obviously historical”, and that was
“a vital part of the overall story”. Mr Campbell added:
“The media/political judgement will inevitably focus on ‘what’s new?’ and I was
pleased to hear from you and your SIS colleagues that, contrary to media reports
today, the intelligence community are taking such a helpful approach to this in
going through all the material they have. It goes without saying that there should
be nothing published that you and they are not 100 percent happy with.”

145 

Minute Campbell to Scarlett, 9 September 2002, [untitled].

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

294.  Mr Campbell also wrote:
“Our public line is that the dossier will set out the facts which make HMG judge
Iraq/WMD to represent a real threat. It will be detailed and comprehensive.”
295.  Mr Campbell set out the need to avoid leaks and comments to the media which
might “talk up the dossier”, adding:
“We should be making clear that even with the intelligence material, the picture can
never be a complete one because the inspectors have been out for so long.”
296.  “[M]ost of the draft material” would be available later that day, “with the Agencies
providing the sections relevant to the middle part of our structure [Iraq’s chemical,
biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes], and the FCO providing the more
historical material”. Mr Scarlett would “want to go through the material before submitting
a consolidated draft to No.10 and others”.
297.  Mr Campbell would “chair a team”, including officials from the FCO and No.10,
who would “go through the document from a presentational point of view and make
recommendations” to Mr Scarlett, who would decide whether they would be incorporated
in the dossier.
298.  Once Mr Scarlett had reached a view on what would be “incorporated”, a
“judgement” would be needed on “whether a single person should be appointed
to write the final version”.
299.  Mr Blair had “expressed an interest in seeing an advanced draft”. The timing
and arrangements for the launch of the document, including the involvement of Mr Blair
and other Ministers, were to be addressed once an advanced draft of the document
was available.
300.  Mr Campbell concluded by referring to US intent to produce “a series of dossiers”
and wrote that he was “confident” that the UK dossier could complement rather than
conflict with them.
301.  Mr Campbell’s minute was sent to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon as well as to the
intelligence Agencies, Sir David Omand, Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator,
and senior officials in the FCO and the MOD.
302.  Mr Campbell wrote that he had had a meeting with Mr Scarlett on the dossier
before being “joined by three SIS people”, and they had “agreed a process for writing
the report”. He and Mr Scarlett had agreed that “the FCO was trying to take it over”,
and Mr Scarlett wanted ownership.146
303.  Mr Campbell also wrote that he told Mr Straw that Mr Williams “should be part
of the team, not the writer”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

304.  In a minute to Mr Blair in June 2003 Mr Scarlett wrote that, following Mr Blair’s
announcement on 3 September, the structure of the dossier had been discussed
between Sir David Manning, Mr Campbell and himself and their respective teams.147
The purpose of the dossier was “to present a more detailed account of Iraqi capabilities
to be placed in the wider context”.
305.  Mr Scarlett added:
“Unlike the previous drafts, it would refer specifically to intelligence material. It
was agreed that since this would now be an intelligence-based document I, as JIC
Chairman, rather than OD Secretariat would be in charge of the process. These
agreements were set out in detail in Alastair’s note to me of 9 September …”
306.  Mr Scarlett added that the drafting of the revised document was co-ordinated by
Mr Miller, “working with representatives of Departments, including DIS, SIS, GCHQ,
and FCO”. The draft had been discussed at “two meetings of two to three hours each”
and there had been “numerous exchanges of drafts and constant consultation between
the experts concerned”. The intelligence Agencies had agreed to the involvement of
Mr Daniel Pruce, a Press Officer in No.10, and Mr Williams and others from the FCO
Press Office. JIC members were asked to consult Ministers during the drafting process
“as appropriate”.
307.  Mr Scarlett also wrote:
“The aim was to ensure that the public assessment deployed the intelligence
effectively, taking account of the reliability of the information and the demands
of source protection.”
308.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that he had had a discussion with Mr Campbell
before the meeting on 9 September to say that:
“… it was very important that only one person and one unit had ownership and
command and control of this exercise, that that should be me, that I wanted it stated
clearly in writing; and I wanted that to be the outcome of the meeting …”148
309.  Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:
“… the whole purpose of having the JIC own this document was in order to
provide the absolute clarity and certainty … that in the end they were perfectly
happy with this. And I think it was … it was essential that anything we said …
in the dossier we could hand on heart say: this is the assessment of the Joint
Intelligence Committee.”149

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

Draft dossier, 10 September 2002
310.  A DIS record of a meeting held by Mr Miller on 9 September recorded that the DIS
had been asked to address a number of points including:

•	
•	

“the provision of more detail on Iraq’s military capability to use WMD”;

•	

“to provide information if possible on the diversion and attempted illicit
procurement of dual-use materials and equipment”; and

•	

“the provision of more information on the retention of experts and expertise
relating to WMD”;

“the provision of a timeline for the development of a nuclear weapon by Iraq
if it were to acquire fissile material.”150

311.  Mr Scarlett produced a first draft of the new dossier on 10 September which
drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment and the recent intelligence reports
about Saddam Hussein’s willingness to use chemical and biological weapons.
The draft stated that Iraq could deploy such weapons within 45 minutes of the
order being given for their use.
312.  A first draft of the revised dossier was produced on 10 September and sent to
Mr Campbell, Mr Powell, Sir David Manning, Sir David Omand, the Private Secretaries
to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, Mr Desmond Bowen, who succeeded Mr McKane as Deputy
Head of OD Sec in the week beginning 9 September, and to Mr John Williams.151
313.  Mr Scarlett wrote that he had had “considerable help from John Williams and
others in the Foreign Office”. The draft required further work and he could not confirm
that he was “content with the overall tone … and the balance between the main text
and the Annexes”, but it had “now reached the stage where it would be useful” to have
advice on presentation from Mr Campbell. Mr Williams might also offer further views.
314.  Mr Scarlett added that the draft drew “on all the available intelligence identified
so far”. He was “most grateful for the co-operation of the SIS, GCHQ and the DIS in
constructing the key section on Iraq’s capabilities”; and the drafters continued to “check
for any further intelligence for inclusion in the text”.
315.  Mr Scarlett concluded by asking recipients to “hold the text very tight” and
to “continue to refrain from public reference to its contents”.
316.  The draft Foreword drew heavily on Mr Williams’ 5 September revisions
to Mr McKane’s draft “capping piece”.
317.  The Executive Summary stated that the paper set out the Government’s
“knowledge” of Iraq’s programmes to acquire weapons of mass destruction, traced

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

their history, and, “Drawing on very sensitive intelligence”, set out the assessment of
current capabilities and showed how the picture was “continuing to develop as new
information becomes available”.
318.  Specifically, the Executive Summary stated that recent intelligence had added
to the picture of Iraq’s capabilities and indicted that Iraq:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

attached “great importance to the possession of weapons of mass destruction
and that Saddam Hussein is committed to using them if necessary”;
envisaged “the use of weapons of mass destruction in its current military
planning and could deploy such weapons within 45 minutes of the order being
given for their use”;
had “begun dispersing its most sensitive weapons, equipment and material
because Saddam is determined not to lose the capabilities developed in the last
four years”;
was “preparing plans to conceal evidence of its weapons of mass destruction
from any renewed inspections, including by dispersing incriminating documents”;
had “acquired mobile laboratories for military use, corroborating earlier
report[ing] about the mobile production of biological warfare agents”;
had “purchased large quantities of uranium ore, despite having no civil nuclear
programme that could require it”.

319.  The draft comprised six sections:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein’s regime and his rise to power;
Saddam Hussein’s wars;
Iraq’s WMD programme – the threat in 1991;
The response of the international community;
The history of UN weapons inspectors;
Iraqi chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes: the current
position.

320.  The section on Iraq’s current capabilities stated:
“Intelligence plays a central role in informing government policy towards Iraq’s
weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programmes. The reports are
often very sensitive … But, taken with Saddam’s record of using chemical weapons
and the evidence from UN weapons inspections, the intelligence builds a compelling
picture of Saddam’s capabilities.
“This section sets out what we now know …”

174

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

321.  Other statements in the section included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Iraq could “deliver chemical and biological agents using an extensive range
of artillery shells, free-fall bombs, sprayers and ballistic missiles”.
“Intelligence from reliable and well-informed sources has become available in
the last few weeks. This has confirmed that Iraq has chemical and biological
weapons and the Iraqi leadership has been discussing a number of issues
related to them.”
“[T]he order to produce … chemical and biological agents has been given”.
Intelligence had confirmed that the Iraqi military had acquired mobile facilities
to produce biological agent.
“If Iraq acquired sufficient fissile material from abroad we judge it would take at
least two years to make a working nuclear device. However, Iraq could produce
an improvised nuclear device within a few months but this would be unreliable.”

322.  Addressing the specific issue of the use of intelligence “about the deployability
of CBW within 45 minutes”, Mr Scarlett wrote in his minute to Mr Blair in June 2003:
“This intelligence came from a line of reporting judged to be reliable and was
consistent with standing JIC judgements it was included by the drafters and
approved by the JIC. It’s [sic] inclusion was not suggested by No.10. The report
was highlighted in the same terms in a JIC Assessment of 9 September.”152
323.  Mr Scarlett added that the 9 September Assessment reflected other recently
received intelligence and that was “recorded in the dossier under the heading,
‘Recent Intelligence’”.
THE VIEW OF THE JIC
324.  The JIC discussed the dossier on Iraq in its meeting on 11 September,
including that:

•	
•	

the Committee’s authority would lend important weight to the dossier’s
content and enhance its impact; and
the dossier needed to “convey accurately but dramatically the rising
concern about Iraq’s weapons programmes” and that recent intelligence
had shed light on progress since 1998.

325.  Mr Scarlett wrote to JIC members on 10 September asking for comments on
an additional section which he had agreed with Mr Campbell “would be considered for
inclusion in the ‘dossier’”.153 It gave “an account of the JIC assessment of developments
in Iraqi WMD programmes since UNSCOM inspectors were withdrawn in late 1998”,

which would “demonstrate that this question has been the subject of continuous
assessment throughout the four years and has been brought to the regular attention
of the Government”.
326.  Mr Scarlett wrote that he “hoped to be able to brief you further at JIC on
11 September” and that he “would particularly welcome your comments on the
attachment”, which set out key points from relevant JIC Assessments.154
327.  Mr Scarlett also sent the 10 September draft of the dossier to the members of the
JIC on 11 September. Describing it as “very much work in progress”, Mr Scarlett wrote:
“… several sections … are already being rewritten. Nevertheless, you need to see
where we have got to. I would be grateful if you could study the intelligence-related
sections … and let me or Julian Miller have your views by mid-day tomorrow, if
not at this afternoon’s JIC. We particularly need advice on any remaining security
implications of publishing … We also need to be sure that overall the balance of
the judgements remains consistent with those previously reached by the JIC.”155
328.  A member of the DIS expressed concern about the reference in the draft to Iraq
producing an improvised nuclear device (IND).156
329.  The DIS official wrote:
“As I feared, the whole issue of Iraq considering the development of an IND has
gained momentum. I would like to delete all mention of INDs in the dossier, but
the CO [Cabinet Office] consider it vital to the picture for no sensible reason.
Unfortunately an Iraqi JIC paper referred to it (against DI52 advice) and that
is being used as a justification. This will probably grow as the dossier is released
to the press, with the result that the spotlight will be diverted from the real, important
issues. However, this does not concern the CO. If you have a chance to advise CDI
[Chief of Defence Intelligence] before this afternoon’s JIC, I would appreciate your
support on the removal of all mention of INDs …”
330.  The DIS official stated that he had only agreed language saying that Iraq would
not go down this route.
331.  There is no mention of INDs in the published version of the dossier.

332.  A separate email from the same DIS official stated that a member of his team
would “not give the idea of an IND time of day” and assessed there were only two
scenarios to consider:
“(a) If Saddam still thinks he has time on his side, he will try to develop a nuclear
weapon … Iraq won’t succeed while sanctions are in place, and will take at least
five years once sanctions are removed …
“(b) In the last resort – when his regime and he are about to fall with the US infantry
on the doorstep, he will use what ever he can do rapidly – eg indiscriminate
spreading of CB agents and toxic chemical … One point which I believe everyone
has missed in the ridiculous debate on INDs is that there will be one obvious last
ditch action that Saddam will take in the spirit of torching the oilfields as he retreated
in 1991 … demolish the store of natural and low-enriched yellowcake … in the
southern outskirts of Baghdad .. There is no risk of a nuclear blast … However …
Saddam would want to play on the irrational fears in Western opinion as he heads
for a safe haven. He would, of course, blame … the US …”157
333.  The DIS official also provided draft language explaining how difficult nuclear
weapons were to make.
334.  At the JIC on 11 September, Mr Scarlett explained that his “purpose in circulating
the draft, and in tabling it for discussion, was to invite comments on its content.
In particular on the question of whether or how best to describe or present the work the
JIC had done in the last several years to assess Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction
capabilities and intentions.”158
335.  The minutes record that the main points which were made were:
“a.	 the part of the draft that looked at what was known or assessed from
intelligence was at the heart of the dossier with the potential to have a significant
impact. It needed to be as factual as possible, and to convey accurately but
dramatically the rising concern about Iraq’s weapons programmes. It needed
in particular to emphasise the importance of recent intelligence in shedding light
on the progress Iraq had made since 1998, and on Saddam Hussein’s readiness
to deploy and use these weapons;
b.	 it made good sense both to describe the way that the JIC and the central
intelligence machinery had kept Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programme
under regular review, and to outline in the main body of the text what the
Committee’s key judgements or messages to Ministers and policy makers since
1998 had been. The Committee’s authority would lend important weight to
the dossier’s content and enhance its impact. But on balance, to avoid setting

unhelpful precedent, it would be better not to quote directly from specific or
identified JIC Assessments themselves.”
336.  It was also suggested that it would be a good idea to keep the Intelligence and
Security Committee informed of what was proposed.
337.  Mr Scarlett invited Mr Miller:
“… to lead on preparing a revised version of the dossier for further comment,
to be circulated later in the week. The new draft would in particular describe the
impact of recent intelligence and explain the evolution and significance of the JIC’s
assessments. The Committee’s agreement to the section of the draft dealing with
the intelligence assessment would be sought before the dossier was finalised.”
338.  There is no record of any discussion of the substance of specific points in the
draft dossier.
339.  Sir Richard Dearlove, Sir Francis Richards, Air Marshal Joe French (Chief of
Defence Intelligence), Sir David Omand, Sir David Manning, Mr Simon Webb (MOD
Policy Director), Mr Bowen, Ms Eliza Manningham-Buller (Deputy Director General
of the Security Service), and Mr Mike Grannatt (Cabinet Office Director General,
Government Information and Communication Service (GICS)), were among those
present at the meeting.
340.  In its discussion of the future work programme, the JIC “agreed that there was
an increasing appetite for papers on aspects of the Iraqi question”.
341.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that his instructions from the JIC were
“to keep what we were writing in line with standing JIC Assessments and also with
recent intelligence”.159
342.  Mr Scarlett also stated that the JIC had given its formal agreement to taking
on the dossier; and that it had responded with several important points. It wanted the
drafters to:

•	
•	
•	
•	

159 
160 

“… convey the rising level of concern on which the JIC took its view about Iraq’s
programmes and development of weapons of mass destruction.”
“… in particular … to highlight the progress which was being made since 1998,
despite sanctions.”
“… make it clear the JIC assessment that Iraq was ready to use these
weapons.”
“… take full account of the recent intelligence which had been coming in.”160

343.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Hutton Inquiry that he had seen the draft dossier
before the JIC meeting, and that it was “normal practice” for him “to be closely briefed”
before JIC meetings.161 He added that the process of producing the dossier had been
“covered very closely on a day-to-day basis” by an SIS team, and that he had been “kept
closely involved”.
344.  Asked if any comments from the DIS had been raised on the 45 minutes point
at the JIC discussion on 11 September, Sir Richard Dearlove told Lord Hutton on
15 September: “Not that I can recall. It was not raised.”162
345.  An SIS officer, who was not an expert in the issues addressed in the dossier,
sent a colleague unsolicited general views about the draft. The officer questioned
the language used in the draft, which he thought needed to be more convincing in
answering the questions “Why Iraq?” and “Why now?”. The minute was also sent
to senior managers. It was drawn to the attention of Sir Richard Dearlove, by his
Private Secretary, before a meeting with Mr Blair on 12 September.163
346.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary recorded that Sir Richard found the
comments useful and timely, and that Sir Richard had drawn on them extensively
in his meeting with Mr Blair.164
347.  The meeting with Mr Blair is addressed later in this Section.
OTHER COMMENTS ON 10 SEPTEMBER DRAFT DOSSIER
348.  Mr Bowen pointed out that it was unclear what Saddam Hussein intended
to do with any weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles.
349.  Commenting on the draft dossier of 10 September, Mr Bowen wrote:

•	

•	

“The bit of the jigsaw that doesn’t quite hang together is what Saddam intends
to do with the WMD he has been so intent on acquiring. It is one thing to ask
the rhetorical question: what could they be used for except making mischief
regionally; it is another to be able to point to stated objectives either from the
intelligence or public documents. It is, of course, the case that you point to the
facts of Saddam’s aggression and repression and use of WMD; perhaps we can
make more of this and his unpredictability.”
“In looking at the WMD sections, you clearly want to be as firm and authoritative
as you can be. You will need to judge the extent to which you need to hedge
your judgements with … caveats. I appreciate that this can increase the
authenticity of the document in terms of it being a proper assessment, but that
needs to be weighed against the use that will be made by the opponents of

action who will add up the number of judgements on which we do not have
absolute clarity.”
“… [T]here are two key sections … which will need to be given proper
prominence … Why Are We Concerned and the Conclusions.”
“I think it would be helpful to draw together the state of advancement of both
chemical and biological capability, with military thinking and the delivery means.”
“It would be helpful if there was more about where ballistic missiles are likely
to be targeted rather than what countries are in range.”165

350.  Mr Bowen concluded:
“Finally the question which we have to have in the back of our minds is ‘Why Now?’.
I think we have moved away from promoting the idea that we are in imminent danger
of attack and therefore intend to act in pre-emptive self defence. The approach
is rather that Saddam has failed to abide by the UNSCRs and his flouting of
international law and continuing acquisition of WMD cannot be tolerated any longer.
This difference is important because the focus shifts to Saddam’s continuing efforts
to equip himself with WMD, which is what the evidence shows.”
351.  Mr Bowen’s comments on the draft Foreword are addressed later in this Section.
352.  Asked whether he had felt under pressure to firm up the judgements in the draft as
a result of Mr Bowen’s comments, Mr Scarlett told the Inquiry that he had “no memory”
of seeing the document and no action had been recorded on it.166
353.  Mr Sedwill asked the UK Permanent Mission in New York for advice on
whether the UK should table the dossier in the Security Council in support
of a US resolution on Iraq.
354.  In advice for No.10 on 27 August, Mr Straw had addressed a possible draft
resolution containing an ultimatum to Iraq to readmit inspectors, and what President
Bush might say in his speech to the UN General Assembly on 12 September as part of a
wider challenge to the UN to demonstrate that it could tackle the problem of WMD in the
hands of rogue states.167 He suggested that a subsequent Security Council discussion
might provide “a peg for publishing via the UN the long-awaited ‘Iraq Dossier’”.
355.  On 11 September, Mr Sedwill reported that he had sent the draft dossier to
Mr Straw’s “party” in New York, to check whether they think it is along the right lines”.168
He had also asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the
United Nations in New York, to advise on whether any or all of it might be tabled in the
Security Council to support the UK intervention when the US tabled their resolution.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

It is clear from the email that the timing of publication was uncertain, and that Mr Sedwill
and Mr Campbell had discussed the possibility of publication in the week beginning
17 September.
356.  Mr Sedwill commented that the draft was “much better than earlier drafts” and
“could move further in the direction of factual analysis”. The document needed to “set
out the problem, rather than the solution”; people “should conclude that for themselves”.
He made a number of detailed suggestions for additions and amendments to the draft.
His suggestions included:

•	
•	

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The Executive Summary could be “tweaked a bit” to “explain the centrality
of WMD” to Saddam Hussein’s rule, for example his projection of power.
“Crucially”, Section 2 needed to “explain the role of WMD in the political
mythology which has sustained the regime, implicitly why giving it up would
amount to a change of regime and how responsibility for WMD rests with those
parts of the apparatus on which Saddam depends for his own security. People
need to understand that for Saddam giving up WMD is not like a British Govt
deciding we don’t need Trident any more …”
Section 3 should be depersonalised “a bit”, with references to “the regime” rather
than Saddam Hussein.
The effects of chemical and biological agents could be explained “more vividly”.
Sections 3 and 4 should be combined to “demonstrate more explicitly the link
between UNSC [UN Security Council] action and persistent Iraqi obstruction”.
The history of weapons inspections was “an interesting story and would give the
media a better feel for the difficulties they faced and the persistence of the Iraqi
obstruction”. It should be expanded.
Section 6, setting out the detail of Iraq’s programmes, was the “crux” of the
dossier and should be as factual as possible.

357.  Mr Sedwill subsequently reported that Mr Straw had endorsed his comments and
offered a number of additional points.169
358.  Mr Straw’s suggestion that the Foreword should be signed by Mr Blair is addressed
later in this Section.
359.  A junior official in the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS
New York) replied that it would “probably be a bit much to deposit the whole report with
the Security Council, though we could deposit something like Section 6 if this were
felt useful”.170

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

360.  The official also commented that the draft was “a substantial improvement” and
suggested adding a number of points, including:

•	
•	
•	

“Something showing the elaborate Iraqi apparatus of concealment would
demonstrate to just what lengths this government is going to keep its hands
on WMD”.
It “would be desirable to give more detail of dodgy procurements … We need
to show the lengths Iraq has been willing to go to get its hands on WMD
components”.
Explaining why Iraq’s unilateral destruction of WMD was of such concern,
“ie it allowed Iraq to obscure its WMD stocks and capabilities, eg by claiming
to have destroyed more items than was actually the case”.

INSTRUCTIONS FROM NO.10

Mr Blair’s speech to the TUC, 10 September 2002
In the first section of his speech to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on 10 September,
Mr Blair set out the rationale for tackling the problem of Iraq – “why I say Saddam is a
threat that has to be dealt with”.171
Mr Blair stated that “when the weapons inspectors were evicted from Iraq in 1998 there
were still enough chemical and biological weapons remaining to devastate the entire
Gulf region”. He also stated that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear programme, which
he had denied and which had been “disrupted” by inspections. He was in breach of
“23 outstanding UN obligations requiring him to admit inspectors and disarm”.

361.  The Assessments Staff reported that No.10 was understood to want the
dossier to be as strong as possible within the available intelligence, subject
to it being owned by the Joint Intelligence Committee.
362.  On 11 September, Mr Blair wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and
to the Lord Chancellor, asking for Parliament to be recalled in the week beginning
23 September (see Section 3.4).172 Mr Blair wrote:
“By then, important discussions at the UN will have taken place. And the
Government will be in a position to publish the dossier on what we know of the Iraqi
regime and its WMD programme.”

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

363.  An email from an official in the Assessments Staff at 1pm on 11 September stated:
“We have now received comments back from No.10 … Unsurprisingly they have
further questions and areas they would like expanded.”173
364.  The official wrote that the “main comments” from No.10 were:
“1. They liked the use of a specific personality … in the paras on CW. Can we add
any more personalities, related to BW, nuclear, BM [ballistic missiles], who are doing
jobs now that are suspiciuos [sic] because of their previous role …
“2. Is there any intelligence that Iraq has actively sought to employ foreign experts,
in particular in the nuclear field?
“3. They want more details on the items procured for their nuclear programme – how
many did they buy, what does this equate to in terms of significance to a nuclear
programme?
“4. Can we say how many chemical and biological weapons Iraq currently has
by type! If we cant give weapons numbers can we give any idea on the quantity
of agent available!
“I appreciate everyone, us included, has been around at least some of these buoys
before, particularly item 4.”
365.  The official concluded:
“But No.10 through the Chairman want the document to be as strong as possible
within the bounds of avaialable [sic] intelligence. This is therefore a last (!) call for
any items of intelligence that agencies think can and should be included.”
366.  In a postscript, the official added:
“[…] we have already discussed the continuing need to say something about Iraq’s
capability to make INDs [Improvised Nuclear Devices] (as per March JIC paper).”
367.  The email was not specific about who in No.10 was being quoted or how the
message was conveyed.
368.  A series of internal emails within No.10 on 10 and 11 September, some
of which were written after the email from the Assessments Staff, discussed
the approach to be taken in the dossier.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

369.  Mr Pruce commented on 10 September that he thought the dossier should focus
on Saddam Hussein as much as possible and use personal witness statements about
Saddam’s abuses and quotations from Saddam’s speeches. He added:
“In the public’s mind the key difference between this text and the IISS text will be the
access to intelligence material I like the idea of a history of JIC Assessments Might
we also include a general statement on the nature of the intelligence services and
their role …”174
370.  On 11 September, Mr Pruce wrote:
“Who will issue the text? Us? The Cabinet Office? Why don’t we issue it in the name
of the JIC? Makes it more interesting to the media.”175
371.  Mr Pruce suggested that:

•	
•	

The draft should be personalised onto Saddam “as much as possible”.

•	

Wherever there was a reference to weapons, there should be a description
of their destructive capacity.

The aim should be to “convey the impression that … over the past decade he
[Saddam Hussein] has been aggressively and relentlessly pursuing WMD while
brutally repressing his own people”.

372.  Mr Pruce commented that the section on intelligence would be:
“… the one that readers will go to first. This draft already plays up the nature of
intelligence sourcing. I think we could play this up more The more we advertise that
unsupported assertions (eg Saddam attaches great importance to the possession
of WMD) come from intelligence the better The history of JIC Assessments will
help too …”
373.  Mr Pruce’s comments on the Foreword are set out later in this Section.
374.  Mr Philip Bassett, a Special Adviser in No.10, commented:
“Very long way to go I think … we’re in a lot of trouble with this as it stands now”.176
375.  Mr Tom Kelly, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, wrote that the draft had
“one central weakness”, it did “not differentiate enough between capacity and intent”:
“We know he is trying to get WMD – and this shows those attempts are intensifying
But can we show why we think he intends to use them aggressively, rather than in
self-defence We need that to counter the argument that Saddam is bad, but not mad

We also … need more direct argument on why containment is breaking down
In other words, putting the emphasis as much (maybe more) on the present and
future, as the past
“The key must be to show that Saddam has the capacity, and is intent on using it
in ways that threaten world stability, and that our ability to stop him is increasingly
threatened.”177
376.  Mr Rycroft responded:
“yes, part of the answer to ‘why now?’ is that the threat will only get worse if we
don’t act now – the threat that Saddam will use WMD, but also the threat that Iraq’s
WMD will somehow get into the hands of the terrorists […] This all links into the illicit
money, since the more funds he has – and his cash pile is growing all the time – the
more likely he is to buy fissile material etc”.178
377.  Mr Godric Smith, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, wrote:
“I think there is material here we can work with but it is a bit of a muddle and needs
a lot more clarity in the guts of it in terms of what is new/old In each area we need
to distinguish between the two and better source (as much as we can) to intelligence
It needs to be more factual if anything, less assertion based, with the rhetoric
stripped out as I think this undermines it”.179
378.  Mr Bassett responded that he agreed with Mr Smith and suggested that the
language of the dossier was “too journalistic”, it needed to be written “more in officialese”
and “much more weight and detail”:
“- crucially though, it’s intelligence-lite … All intelligence material tends to read like
unevidenced assertion, and we have to find a way to get over this a) by having
better intelligence material […], b) by having more material (and better flagged-up),
and c) more convincing material …”180
379.  There was a meeting between Mr Campbell and Mr Scarlett, and others from
No.10, at 6pm on 11 September.181
380.  In his diaries Mr Campbell wrote that he:
“… gave some suggestions later re a different structure. We had the basic story
and now had to fill it out. TB looked at it and said it was pretty compelling stuff.”182

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

381.  When Mr Miller asked to talk to someone in No.10 about the latest thinking
on the dossier, “without getting into circulating copies just so as they are on the right
track”, Mr Smith suggested he should speak to Mr Campbell or Mr Tom Kelly on
13 September.183
382.  On 13 September, Mr Campbell wrote:
“Meeting with Julian Miller … to go through the new structure. I was worried that
it was going to have to rely too much on assertion …”184
383.  In relation to the recall of Parliament, Mr Campbell also wrote:
“I was worried that the dossier was going to be too assertive and that even
though the agencies presented it as their work, it would be seen as us trying
to spin them a line.”
384.  Mr Campbell told the Hutton Inquiry that, in relation to the dossier, he had told
Mr Scarlett: “The drier the better, cut the rhetoric”; and that “the more intelligence
based it was, the better”. There was a need to distinguish between material in the
Government’s dossier and the IISS publication.185
385.  Asked about the emails from Mr Pruce, Mr Smith and Mr Bassett, Mr Campbell
said that he could not recall seeing them.186
386.  Mr Campbell was not asked about the emails from Mr Kelly and Mr Rycroft.
387.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that he had not seen the No.10 emails at the
time but he could see from the documents presented to him that some of the main
comments had been made orally in the discussion that had taken place in Mr Campbell’s
office at 6pm on 11 September 2002.187
388.  Asked whether he had received the comments from No.10 orally from Mr Campbell,
Mr Scarlett stated that the person who had drafted the email recalled only that
Mr Scarlett had said to him that the points were from No.10. Mr Scarlett had “no
recollection” and “no record” of receiving the points, or who they were received from.188
389.  Mr Campbell subsequently told the Hutton Inquiry that, in relation to the content
of the emails between Mr Bassett, Mr Smith and Mr Pruce, he stood by what he had
said on 19 August 2003; and that he could not recall pointing out any of the sentiments
to Mr Scarlett in their meeting on 11 September.189

390.  Mr Scarlett stated that he remembered Mr Bassett being at the meeting with
Mr Campbell, but he did not remember what Mr Bassett had said and he did not
remember taking any notice of it.190 Mr Scarlett added:
“… the general advice that I took away from Alastair Campbell, from nobody else …
was that the … draft … needed, ideally, to have more detail in it, needed to be less
assertive, less rhetorical … And indeed the 16th September draft was clearly striking
a slightly different tone in its language.”
391.  Asked about the views expressed in the emails and their impact, Mr Campbell told
the Inquiry:
“That may have been their honestly held opinions, but I didn’t agree with them.
I actually thought that the paper that John Scarlett produced on September 10 was
… a very, very good piece of work. So, as I said at the Hutton inquiry, they are all
perfectly entitled to make those points, if that’s their opinion, but, ultimately, it would
not be their decision …”191
392.  Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry that he was aware of the process for
producing the dossier, and his view was that it was “important that it made
the best case we could make subject, obviously, to it being owned by the Joint
Intelligence Committee”.
393.  There is no evidence that Mr Blair saw the emails on the issue between
officials in No.10.
394.  Asked, in the light of the comment that No.10 had wanted the dossier “to be as
strong as possible within the bounds of available intelligence”, whether he was aware
that process (the email exchange) was going on, Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry that he
had been aware of that, and “it was important that it [the dossier] made the best case we
could make subject, obviously, to it being owned by the Joint Intelligence Committee”.192
395.  Mr Blair added that, as Parliament was being recalled and he would be presenting
the dossier, he had been concerned to make sure the dossier made the “best case”:
“Provided that is clearly understood as meaning that it is only if the intelligence
agencies thought both that the actual intelligence should be included and that there
was not improper weight being given to any aspect of that intelligence.”193

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

THE US PERSPECTIVE
396.  The discussions with the US about President Bush’s speech to the UN General
Assembly on 12 September are addressed in Section 3.4. Key points from the speech
are set out in the Box below.

President Bush’s speech, 12 September 2002
In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 12 September, President Bush set out his
view of the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged the
UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security Council
since 1990.194
President Bush made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN the world must hold Iraq to account
and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the necessary resolutions”.
But the US would not stand by and do nothing in the face of the threat.
President Bush set out Iraq’s failure to meet those obligations imposed by the UN,
including:

•	

“Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the
production of biological weapons.”

•	

UN inspections had revealed that Iraq “likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard
and other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding
facilities capable of producing chemical weapons”.

•	

Iraq continued “to withhold important information about its nuclear program”;
employed “capable nuclear scientists and technicians”; and retained “the physical
infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon”. It had “made several attempts to
buy high-strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon”.
If Iraq acquired fissile material, “it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within
a year”.

•	

Iraq’s “state controlled media” had “reported numerous meetings between
Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his
continued appetite for these weapons”.

•	

Iraq also possessed “a force” of SCUD-type missiles with greater than permitted
range and was “building more … that can inflict mass death throughout the
region”.

•	

Iraq had “subverted” the Oil-for-Food programme “to buy missile technology and
military materials”.

•	

Despite the UN’s demands for the return of inspectors, Iraq had had “four years …
to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy”.

Challenging the UN to act, President Bush stated:
“We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when
inspectors were in his country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left?
The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein’s regime

194

188

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

is a grave and gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the
evidence. To assume … good faith is … a reckless gamble … [T]his is a risk we must
not take.
“We have been more than patient … Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts
and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be
completely certain he has … nuclear weapons is when … he uses one. We owe it to
all our citizens to prevent that day from coming.”

397.  Mr Scarlett discussed the draft dossier with US Administration officials
on 12 September.
398.  Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, reported that, in meetings
on 12 September, US Administration officials had welcomed Mr Scarlett’s briefing on the
UK plan to publish a dossier on Iraqi WMD on 24 September.195
399.  Mr Scarlett had “stressed the importance of co-ordinating UK and US public
presentation strategies”. The issues discussed included:

•	
•	

recent Iraqi attempts to procure aluminium tubes; and
the differences between US and UK assessments of the timelines for Iraq to
acquire a nuclear weapons capability. President Bush had said publicly, notably
in his speech to the UN General Assembly, that, if it obtained fissile material,
Iraq could build a nuclear weapon within a year.

400.  Sir Christopher Meyer also wrote:
“US interlocutors all pointed more generally to the need not to get trapped into
juridical standards of proof. The bulk of the case should rest on history and
common‑sense argument, rather than specific new intelligence. When it came to
Saddam’s WMD, absence of evidence was not the same as evidence of absence.
We should not be afraid to argue that, just as in 1991, Iraq’s programmes were
probably much further advanced than we knew.”
401.  One official in the National Security Council suggested:
“… setting out convincing arguments as to why Saddam continued his costly pursuit
of WMD. Deterring attacks on the regime was not a full explanation. For Saddam,
WMD were weapons of choice, not of last resort. In particular … [he] believed,
Saddam wanted nuclear weapons so that he could threaten or use CW or BW in the
region, and use his nuclear capability to deter nuclear retaliation … we should not be
afraid to make this argument publicly.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

402.  Mr Scarlett also discussed the draft with the CIA:
“The WMD section of the 10 September draft was also shown to the US Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) and they made comments.”196

SIS report, 11 September 2002
403.  On 11 September, SIS issued a report stating:

•	
•	
•	

Iraq had accelerated the production of chemical and biological agent;
it had built further facilities throughout Iraq; and
Saddam Hussein was determined to maintain his CBW capability.

404.  SIS expected to receive additional material through the same source.
405.  Reflecting concerns about source protection, the report was given a very
limited distribution to named senior officials.
406.  The report did not make clear that SIS was not itself in contact with the
source whom it considered had direct access to Iraq’s programmes.
407.  The Butler Report stated:
“One further intelligence report which has been described to us as being significant
was received between the production of the JIC’s Assessment of 9 September and
the publication of the Government’s dossier. This … reported that production of
biological and chemical agent had been accelerated by the Iraqi regime, including
through the building of further facilities throughout Iraq.”197
408.  Notes of a telephone discussion between Sir Richard Dearlove and Mr Scarlett
on 11 September recorded that Sir Richard told Mr Scarlett:

•	
•	
•	
•	

SIS was “on the edge of [a] significant intel breakthrough”. The intelligence
was from a “first contact with BCW phenomenal access”. It could be the “key
to unlock” Iraq’s BCW programme.
Asked whether the source definitely had “the access”, Sir Richard replied “yes”.
Sir Richard expected “additional material in 3-4 weeks time”. He mentioned
a “CD with everything in it”.
Sir Richard believed that it would be too risky to include the material from the
new source [in the dossier]: “The moment we publish Saddam will lock up his
BCW scientists.”

Sir Richard was reported to have “summarised the report”, stating: “Production
closed down but sufficient stocks already.”
Mr Scarlett agreed that the report would not be fed into “today’s discussion [of
the draft dossier]”. He was: “Not happy with draft. Section 6 & 7 are keys.”198

409.  A letter from Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary to Sir David Manning,
with two copies of the report (one for Sir David and one for Mr Powell) recorded
that Sir Richard had “referred” to the report during his meeting with Sir David on
10 September.199
410.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Butler Review that he had been aware of the report
and had mentioned it to Sir David Manning at a meeting on 10 September.200 He had
subsequently arranged for the report to be sent to No.10.
411.  SIS issued the new intelligence report on 11 September.201
412.  The report stated that, in early September, a senior official who had a background
of involvement in Iraq’s CW programme described a particular military establishment’s
participation in BW and CW programmes, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“The regime had demanded accelerated production of BCW substances. Senior
workers were working a seven day week and safety measures, which were
common in the 1980s, were now being ignored …”
“Although BW and CW production is centred on Baghdad, the regime has built
further facilities throughout Iraq. There was now excess capacity, with more
production facilities than there were suitably qualified and trusted staff to operate
them.”
Chlorine gas produced at the facility was “shipped to ‘Iraq Atomic Energy’”.
“… [A]nthrax was being produced at a separate facility …”
“Approximately two weeks ago, an order was received to stop producing
prohibited substances at … [the establishment]. All machinery producing these
substances was to be decontaminated and the remaining prohibited substances
sent to storage. The same order had been sent to all MIC [Military Industrial
Commission] factories involved in producing BCW in Iraq.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

413.  The report stated that the SIS source had commented that:

•	
•	
•	
•	

“Saddam Hussein was determined to maintain his CBW capability. If the major
production centres near Baghdad were attacked and damaged, the regime
would order staff to relocate to an alternative undamaged site.”
Iraq “was concentrating its efforts on the production of anthrax and that Iraq had
received a lot of help from neighbouring and friendly countries”.
The action was “in preparation for the admission of weapons inspectors”.
“New accommodation for senior scientists and their colleagues was being built
near to the major BW and CW production sites. The families of those scientists
would, in effect, be held hostage. They would be discouraged from deserting or
from leaking information about activities at their facilities that might lead to the
sites being targeted for bombing by allied forces.”

414.  An SIS comment informed readers that:

•	
•	

Chlorine was “one of the base chemicals for the production of CW agents such
as mustard and the nerve agent sarin”.
Chlorine was also used in the production of uranium trichloride “which in turn
may be used as a feed material for the electromagnetic isotope separation
process (EMIS) to enrich uranium for weapons production”. Iraq had previously
admitted, in its declarations to UNSCOM, “attempting to pursue this route to
produce weapon grade highly enriched uranium” before 1991; and, “Although
Iraq encountered problems in scaling up the production capability, it had
succeeded in producing a small quantity of lower enrichments and was
continuing to resolve the problems before the EMIS programme was halted
by Coalition air strikes.”

415.  The report was described as “high impact” and the source was described as:
“A new source on trial with direct access.” SIS advised that readers would “receive
relevant briefing as soon as can be arranged”.
416.  The report was sent to Mr Simon McDonald (Mr Straw’s Principal Private
Secretary), Sir Michael Jay, Mr Wright, Mr Chaplin, Mr Ehrman, Sir David Manning,
Mr Scarlett, Mr Bowen, Mr Miller, Mr Peter Watkins (Mr Hoon’s Principal Private
Secretary), Sir Kevin Tebbit (MOD Permanent Under Secretary) and Mr Webb.
417.  It was not sent to Sir David Omand, AM French, Mr Tony Cragg, MOD Deputy
Chief of Defence Intelligence (DCDI), or the Heads of GCHQ or MI5.
418.  Documents seen by the Inquiry state that the distribution was approved personally
by Sir Richard Dearlove.

192

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

419.  A minute for the file written by SIS9 recorded that he and Sir Richard Dearlove
had briefed Mr Blair on the sources of the report (of 11 September) on 12 September.202
The sources were not named but Mr Blair was given details of the source’s background
and his access, and his relationship with the sub-source.
420.  Mr Blair was also briefed on two other sources who had provided recent reports.
421.  Sir David Manning, Mr Powell and Mr Campbell were present.
422.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“Meeting with TB, Jonathan, DM, AC, C and a SIS colleague re chemical and
biological weapons, and what Blix would be looking for if the inspectors went in.
It showed what was going on was really bad and getting worse, that he [Saddam
Hussein] was determined to keep WMD for reasons of regional power. They were
strategically vital and he was going to keep them come what may. C said we could
use some of the material through assertion.
“They were confident this stuff was real, not being run against us. SIS believed the
regime would collapse and there would be lots of defections etc. Very interesting
meeting.”203
423.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Butler Review in 2004 that he had had a meeting with
Mr Blair on 12 September to brief him on SIS operations in respect of Iraq, and that he
had briefed the Prime Minister on each of SIS’ main sources including the new source
on trial.204
424.  Sir Richard also told the Butler Review that he had:
“… underlined to the Prime Minister the potential importance of the new source [of
the 11 September report] and what SIS understood his access to be; but also said
that the case was developmental and that the source remained unproven.”
425.  The Butler Report stated that SIS had hopes that this source would become
a major asset.205 In particular, the source had indicated to SIS that he would be able
to provide substantial and critical additional intelligence in the near future.
426.  SIS4 suggested that Mr Blair had already known about the intelligence before
the meeting between Mr Blair and Sir Richard Dearlove on 12 September, and that
he wanted to see the product.206

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

427.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry that “it would have been very rare” for him
to have talked to Ministers or Mr Blair “about our source base”.207
428.  Asked about Mr Blair’s reaction, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that Sir David Manning
had asked him to give Mr Blair a briefing “which would give him [Mr Blair] more of a
flavour for what was actually going on on the ground”.208 Mr Blair “had an appetite for
that sort of briefing which was a pretty rare event”, and had had a “fair amount of general
discussion” with SIS9 “about the difficulties and problems we were facing”.
429.  Asked whether, as some witnesses had suggested, he had been precipitate
in going to Ministers with the report so quickly, Sir Richard replied:
“I think in the circumstances, I don’t agree … because if you issue a report like that
in the middle of a crisis, you’re going to get a phone call from a Ministerial office
within a short period of time.”209
430.  Sir Richard also stated that in the circumstances it would have been “impossible”
not to issue the report; SIS could not “sit on something as potentially important”
as that.210
431.  The SIS report of 11 September was used by Mr Scarlett and Mr Miller
in reaching key judgements about Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons
capabilities included in the Government dossier published on 24 September.
432.  Specifically it provided the assurance for the judgements that Iraq had:

•	
•	

“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”;
“military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons …”

433.  The judgements on Iraq’s production of chemical and biological weapons
and the circumstances in which they could be used became the baseline for
subsequent advice to Ministers and public statements on the threat posed by Iraq.
434.  The Butler Report concluded that the intelligence report (of 11 September) had “a
major effect on the certainty of the statements in the Government’s dossier of September
2002 that Iraq possessed and was producing chemical and biological weapons”.211
435.  The Butler Report added that the SIS report had provided “significant assurance
to those drafting the … dossier that active, current production of chemical and biological
agent was taking place”.212

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

436.  In the context of Sir Richard Dearlove’s evidence, that he had told Mr Blair on
12 September 2002 that the SIS report issued on 11 September was developmental and
the source unproven, the Butler Report stated:
“Nevertheless, it may be that, in the context of the intense interest at that moment
in the status of Iraq’s prohibited weapons programmes, and in particular continuing
work on the dossier, the concurrence of events caused more weight to be given to
this unvalidated new source than would normally have been the case.”213
437.  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Richard Dearlove maintained that material from
the report of 11 September had not been used in the dossier:
“… maybe I should add now, because I’m sure you are going to question me …
I think this is an important point, so we don’t waste too much time on it. I can say
very authoritatively there was no material in the dossier [from the new source on trial
in September 2002].
“I can also say, if you actually look at the introduction to the dossier, it refers to
assessed intelligence, specifically assessed intelligence. [The new source on trial]
was not assessed intelligence, and therefore are actually authoritatively excluded
because they don’t fall into that category, and I had put my foot down and said this
material could not be used.”214
438.  Sir Richard subsequently told the Inquiry that he had insisted that the September
reporting was not included in the dossier because he wanted to retain the source for use
during inspections.215
439.  Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the “further intelligence” reporting on the
“acceleration” of the “production of chemical and biological agent” was “regarded as
significant”.216
440.  Sir John subsequently stated that the report issued on 11 September was
“influential” and “did famously influence what was said in the dossier”.217 He also referred
to a further report from the same source in late September and that “a composite
version” of the two reports had been “issued in early April 2003” and that it “was still

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

SIS report, 23 September 2002
On 23 September, SIS issued a second report from the same sourcing chain as the
11 September report. That stated VX, sarin and soman had been produced at Al-Yarmuk,
and were loaded into a variety of “containers”, including “linked hollow glass spheres”.
The source commented that there had been “accelerated production of CW substances
at Al-Yarmuk for several years”. It was described by SIS as expanding and clarifying the
intelligence in the first report, and that it was “valuable intelligence”.218
The report was circulated to the same restricted group as the report on 11 September,
with the addition of Mr Mark Bowman, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary.
It arrived too late to have influenced the conclusions in the dossier.

442.  When the reporting was reissued in April 2003 Mr Scarlett was not informed
that SIS had doubts about the reliability of the reporting chain. That is addressed
in Section 4.3.
443.  The potential impact of the reporting on Mr Blair’s statement to the House
of Commons on 24 September is addressed later in this Section.

Mr Straw’s speech, 14 September 2002
Mr Straw’s speech to the UN General Assembly on 14 September focused on the critical
role the UN had to play in world affairs, and the “three rising challenges” of failing states,
terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.219
Addressing the threat from proliferation, Mr Straw stated: “Nowhere is the case for
universal support for the enforcement of the UN’s law stronger than in the field of weapons
of mass destruction.” He added:
“… with one infamous exception – no States have resorted to these, the world’s worst
weapons.
“That exception is Iraq. For two decades, Saddam has defied and frustrated
every attempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq is the only country to
be condemned by the United Nations for breaching the Convention on Chemical
Weapons. Iraq has fought two wars of aggression … No country has deceived every
other country in the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq. And no country
presents as fundamental a challenge to the United Nations …”

Draft dossier, 16 September 2002
444.  In a note to No.10 officials covering a range of issues on 15 September, Mr Blair
wrote on Iraq:
“The dossier is crucial. The expectations must be right. Remember the case
we need to make is for the return of a tough inspection regime, not that he
[Saddam Hussein] is about to launch a strike. In my view, advice to me from
the JIC is sufficiently persuasive.”220
445.  Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:
“The purpose of the dossier was to respond to the call to disclose the intelligence
we knew but at that stage the strategy was not to use the dossier as the immediate
reason to go to conflict, but as the reason why we had to return to the issue of
Saddam and weapons of mass destruction …”221
446.  There were a number of significant changes in the revised draft of
the dossier of 16 September, including giving prominence in the Executive
Summary to:

•	
•	
•	

the IISS judgement that Iraq could obtain a nuclear weapon within months
if it obtained fissile material, rather than the JIC’s more conservative view
of one to two years which was not mentioned in the Summary;
Saddam Hussein’s readiness to use weapons of mass destruction and his
determination to retain them; and
a statement that the JIC judged that Iraq continued to produce chemical
and biological agents.

447.  Mr Scarlett sent a revised version of the dossier to JIC members on 16 September,
which put the description of Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile
programmes first.222
448.  The draft did not contain a draft Foreword; the development of the text signed
by Mr Blair is discussed later in this Section.
449.  The key additions to the Executive Summary from the previous draft were
references to:

•	

the “valuable assessment” in the IISS paper of 9 September, including that it
judged “Iraq could assemble nuclear weapons within months of obtaining fissile
material from foreign sources”;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

intelligence providing a “fuller picture of Iraq’s plans and capabilities” and
showing that Saddam Hussein did “not regard them only as weapons of last
resort”; he was “ready to use them … and determined to retain them”; and
intelligence allowing the JIC to judge that Iraq had “continued to produce
chemical and biological agents”; and that Saddam Hussein and his son Qusay
had “the political authority to use” WMD.

450.  The draft included a new Chapter 1 on the role of intelligence, which stated:
“Intelligence rarely offers a complete account of activities which are designed to
remain concealed. And the nature of Saddam’s regime makes Iraq a difficult target
… Nonetheless, we have been able to develop a range of well positioned sources.
The need to protect and preserve these sources inevitably limits the detail that
can be made available. But intelligence has provided important insights into Iraqi
programmes, and into Iraqi military thinking. Taken together with what is already
known from other sources, this builds our understanding of Iraq’s capabilities and
adds significantly to the analysis already in the public domain.
“Iraq’s capabilities have been regularly reviewed by the … JIC, which has provided
advice to the Prime Minister on the developing assessment on the basis of all
available sources … [T]his paper includes some of the most significant views
reached by the JIC between 1999 and 2002.”
451.  The text on Iraq’s programmes was significantly expanded. As well as more detail
on Iraq’s attempts to procure material that could be used for prohibited programmes,
and judgements from JIC Assessments, changes to the previous text included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

a box describing the effect of detonating a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead over
a city;
the addition of statements that: there had been “recent production of chemical
and biological agents”; intelligence confirmed that Iraq continued to produce
chemical agents; and “we know from intelligence that Iraq has continued to
produce biological warfare agents”;
a statement that intelligence had provided “Confirmation” that chemical and
biological weapons played an important role in Iraqi military thinking;
two separate statements that the Iraqi military “may be able to deploy” chemical
and biological weapons within 45 minutes of a decision to do so;
the replacing of the judgement that, if Iraq obtained fissile material, it would take
at least two years to make a working nuclear device, by a statement that it would
be “much shorter” than the five years Iraq would require to produce a nuclear
weapon once sanctions were lifted or became ineffective, and, “depending
on the effectiveness of Iraqi weapons design”, that could be “between one and
two years”; and

198

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•	

the replacing of the reference to an ability to produce an unreliable IND within
a few months, by a reference to Iraqi experimentation with radiological dispersal
devices (RDDs) during 1987, but the programme “never progressed beyond
the research stage and was dropped”. A box described such devices as an
“ineffective weapon”.

452.  The draft also contained a new “Conclusion” summarising the current position.
453.  Mr Scarlett asked that the “representatives” of JIC members attending a meeting
to be chaired by Mr Miller at 0900 the following morning, should “come armed with
suggested additions/ deletions/amendments to be decided at the meeting”.223 He also
asked for “final comments” by 1300 on 17 September.
454.  Mr Scarlett cautioned:
“In public presentation terms, this draft remains a highly sensitive document. I would
therefore be grateful if you each retain very tight control over its distribution …”
455.  Mr Scarlett held a meeting “to work up a strategy on Iraq” later that day.224
456.  A minute from Mr Kelly to Mr Campbell on 17 September suggests that this
discussion was essentially about plans for printing and publishing the document and
preparing supporting material.225
457.  Mr Miller told the Hutton Inquiry that the draft dossier was discussed in a meeting
he chaired on 17 September.226
458.  The Defence Intelligence Staff expressed concerns that some of the
statements in the draft on Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons could not
be substantiated by the intelligence it had seen.
459.  A member of the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) wrote to the Assessment Staff
early on 17 September reflecting concerns that some of the statements on chemical and
biological weapons in the draft could not be substantiated by the intelligence seen by the
DIS.227 The comments included:

•	

“Executive Summary, Para 3 – 1st Bullet: The judgement ‘has continued to
produce chemical and biological agents’ is too strong with respect to CW. ‘has
probably’ would be as far as I would go. And ‘continued to produce BW agents’.
This is quite strong considering what the int actually says. [Iraq has a biological
production capability and can produce at least anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin

and ricin within day of the order to do so. Sought mobile facilities to produce
biological agent. […]]”
“Executive Summary, Para 3 – 2nd Bullet: The judgement ‘has military plans
for the use of chemical and biological weapons, some of which could be ready
within 45 minutes of an order to use them’. Is also rather strong since it is based
on a single source. ‘Could say intelligence suggests …’”
“Part 1, Chapter 2, Para 16: The statement ‘… Iraq continues to produce
chemical and biological agents.’ This is too strong. See comment above.
Suggest ‘may continue to produce’ even ‘probably continues to produce’.”
“Part 1, Chapter 3, Para 1 – 1st Bullet: The statement ‘which has included
recent production of chemical and biological agents;’ is too strong from the CW
perspective. This is based on a single source.”
“Part 1, Chapter 3, Para 5 Recent Intelligence: From the CW perspective the
language is too strong since the information is based on single sources. The
wording ‘intelligence shows that’ is too strong and inappropriate” ‘reports that’,
‘indicates that’, ‘suggests that’ would be more appropriate.”
“Part 1, Chapter 3, Para 8 – Line 1: The statement ‘Intelligence confirms that
Iraq has continued to produce chemical agent.’ This is far too strong considering
the available evidence. The word confirms is totally inappropriate. “Intelligence
suggests that …’ would be better”.
“Part 1, Chapter 3, Para 12: The statement ‘We know from intelligence that Iraq
has continued to produce BW agents’. This is quite strong considering what the
int actually says …”
“Part 1, Chapter 3, Para 16: The statement ‘Iraq has continued to produce
CBW agent’. Some elements of the summary repeat the same overly strong
statements as in the rest of this chapter.”

460.  The response to the DIS concerns is addressed later in this Section.
461.  Mr Blair and officials within No.10 offered a number of comments
on the draft.
462.  Mr Pruce commented that the new draft:

•	
•	
•	

“re-ordered the text, with the new intell nearer the front (might be able to bring it
further forward)”;
“added a short chapter on JIC and intelligence”, which was “Good but could give
more details”;
“kept in the longer nuclear timelines … We need to think carefully about how
these will appear to compare with the IISS figure of a weapon within a few
months”; and

200

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•	

“added a short conclusions table – not sure this adds a lot to the Executive
Summary”.228

463.  Mr Pruce summarised:
“The re-organised material paints a more convincing picture, but the facts remain
thin on nuclear”.
464.  Mr Campbell sent Mr Scarlett his and Mr Blair’s comments on the draft dossier
on 17 September.229
465.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair thought it was “a very good job and it was
convincing”, but had a number of comments. These included that Mr Blair:

•	
•	
•	
•	

thought the chapter on the current position on Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear
and ballistic missile programmes “should be re-ordered, to build towards the
conclusion through detail”;
“like me, was worried about the way you have expressed the nuclear issue
… Can we not go back … to ‘radiological device’ in months; nuclear bomb in
1-2 years with help; 5 years with no sanctions”;
“thought we should make more of the ‘no civil nuclear’ point, and list dual-use
products”; and
“felt we don’t do enough on human rights”.

466.  Mr Campbell’s own comments included:

•	
•	

“… we should make more of the point about current concealment plans.”

•	

The statement that Saddam’s sons “may have” the authority to use chemical and
biological weapons in the text was weaker than the statement in the Summary
that they had that authority.

•	

The Executive Summary “would be stronger if we said that despite sanctions
and the policy of containment, he [Saddam Hussein] has made real progress”.

“Can we say that he [Saddam] has secured uranium from Africa?”

467.  Mr Campbell also asked for Mr Scarlett’s views on the draft Foreword for Mr Blair.
This is addressed later in this Section.
468.  In his diaries Mr Campbell wrote:
“I got the new dossier draft and did detailed comments … TB also read it and
made some comments. Nuclear was the most difficult part. Scarlett and I chatted
away re that.”230

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

469.  In an email to Mr Scarlett on 17 September, Mr Powell wrote:
“The dossier is good and convincing for those who are prepared to be convinced
“I have only three points, none of which affect the way the document is drafted
or presented
“First the document does nothing to demonstrate a threat, let alone an imminent
threat from Saddam In other words it shows he has the means but it does not
demonstrate he has the motive to attack his neighbours let alone the west We will
need to make clear in launching the document that we do not claim to have evidence
that he is an imminent threat The case we are making is that he has continued to
develop WMD since 1998, and is in breach of UN resolutions The international
community has to enforce those resolutions if the UN is to be taken seriously
“Second we will be asked about connections with Al Qaida […]
“Third, if I was Saddam I would take a party of western journalists to the Ibn Sina
factory or one of the others pictured in the document to demonstrate there is nothing
there How do we close off that avenue to him in advance?”231
470.  In his response Mr Scarlett stated:

•	
•	

A note was being prepared on Iraq and Al Qaida.
The dossier stressed the problems [in identifying prohibited activities], posed
by dual-use facilities and the ease of concealment. That “applied to trained
inspectors let alone journalists”.232

471.  Mr Campbell commented:
“I think we risk complicating the issue if we get into links with Al Qaida The dossier,
and the debate in Parliament, are explicitly about Iraq/WMD On the question of
sites, we should in our briefing make clear that we assume he will sanitise one
of them for the media, and pull some stunt, but remain robust re our judgements
Re the ‘imminent threat’, point, that is why TB’s foreword sets out ‘the case I am
making’. John, I will show him your revisions and hopefully get the Foreword signed
off today”.233
472.  In a further email on 18 September, Mr Powell emphasised that he was “not
suggesting any changes to the dossier, just flagging up points where we are going
to need to mould expectations in advance of publication and on publication”.234

202

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

473.  Mr Powell concluded:
“The threat argument will be a major problem in the press/parliamentary assault after
the dossier comes out and we need to flag up the point in the preface at publication
and during the debate We need to set the test for ourselves at a level we can meet”.
474.  Later on 18 September, Mr Campbell sent Mr Scarlett the impressions of a
member of his team whom he had asked to read the draft.235 Mr Campbell wrote that
“Overall, she found it convincing”, “CW/BW in particular”. She had, however, found
the nuclear section confused and unconvincing, and it had left her thinking that there
was “nothing much to worry about”. The section “lacked the clarity of the rest of the
document”.
475.  Mr Campbell added:
“Sorry to bombard on this point, but I do worry that the nuclear section will become
the main focus and as currently drafted is not in great shape.”
476.  Mr Scarlett informed Mr Campbell that he had seen the comments and was taking
account of them in the revision of the dossier.236
477.  Commenting on the Executive Summary, Mr Ed Owen, Mr Straw’s Special Adviser,
wrote that it did not read “well enough to give a sceptical reader the confidence to
believe that the dossier provides the necessary information”.237

Draft dossier, 19 September 2002
478.  Mr Scarlett informed the JIC on 18 September of the latest position on the draft
dossier, and that “a final version would have to be agreed and with the printers by the
end of the following day”.238
479.  The co-ordination arrangements for producing the draft and deciding on its
handling had “gone well”. Mr Scarlett also “said he wanted to thank all those from
the intelligence community who had played a part in the document’s production. Their
helpful, balanced, co-operative and collaborative approach had been much appreciated.”
480.  There is no record of any substantive points being raised.
481.  Sir Stephen Lander, Director General of the Security Service, Sir Francis Richards,
Sir Richard Dearlove, Mr Webb, Mr Cragg, and Sir David Omand were amongst those
present. Sir David Manning, AM French and Mr Bowen were not present.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

482.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that at the JIC on 18 September:
“The Committee also noted that some new intelligence had come in on nuclear
matters which would need to be incorporated in the draft.
“The Committee raised no particular point – no points of further debate or
contention.”239
483.  On 18 September, Mr Scarlett sent Mr Campbell detailed responses to his and
Mr Blair’s comments.240
484.  The response to Mr Blair’s comments included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The revised restructuring suggested by Mr Blair would have “less impact than
the original”.
Mr Scarlett had explained “the decision to drop earlier references to an
improvised nuclear device, on which there is no intelligence”.
No change had been made to the timelines for Iraq to acquire a nuclear weapon
which summarised the JIC position, but one paragraph had been revised to
bring out the judgements more clearly.
Dual-use products had been listed separately; and the impact was “much
improved”.
Material on human rights abuses had been added and the issue was given
“a little more prominence” in the Executive Summary.

485.  Mr Scarlett also addressed Mr Campbell’s more detailed comments, including that
the language on current concerns and plans had been strengthened and the Summary
brought out the point suggested by Mr Campbell – that Iraq was making progress
despite sanctions and containment.
486.  Addressing comments in Mr Campbell’s minute of 17 September, Mr Scarlett told
the Hutton Inquiry:
“… we looked again at what we were saying in the draft about Iraq’s concealment
plans and activities – what the intelligence was saying, and also how we were
expressing the success or otherwise of sanctions and the policy of containment.
“This, of course, was a point that we had been expressly asked to highlight by the
JIC at its meeting of 11 September.
“… [I]ntelligence … was very clear about Iraq’s confidence that it could learn
lessons from its past experience with the inspectors, and pursue effective
concealment plans.”241

487.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell recorded that, on 18 September, he also:
“… went through nuclear section with Julian Miller, which was OK. JS [Jack Straw]
was keen to keep in the very downbeat assessment.”242
488.  In an email on 19 September, Mr Campbell recorded that he told Mr Miller:
“… it would be simpler to have just one clearer section on nuclear timelines, perhaps
along the following lines …
“It is impossible to be precise about nuclear timelines We can be clear however,
that provided sanctions and export controls remain in place and effective, it is
not possible for Iraq to develop nuclear weapons. This is because although they
have the expertise, the design data, the planning and the intent they do not have
the material necessary for the production of fissile material. This contrasts with
CW/BW, which they can produce indigenously. Even if sanctions were removed,
we assess that it would take up to five years for them to develop nuclear
weapons. The timelines are considerably shortened however if Iraq manages
to obtain fissile material illegally from overseas In these circumstances, the JIC
assessed in early 2002 that they could produce nuclear weapons in between
one and two years”.243
489.  Mr Scarlett sent the draft dossier to Mr Campbell on 19 September.244
490.  The minute was also sent to JIC members “on a personal basis, reflecting the
continuing sensitivity of the document and the imperative need to avoid leaks”.
They were asked to let Mr Scarlett have “any essential further comments on this draft
by 15:00 today”.
491.  Mr Scarlett wrote:
“I should draw your attention to some changes to the Executive Summary reflecting
comments from the Foreign Office; to a simplified account of Saddam’s nuclear
programme; and to a restructuring of the final section on Saddam’s Iraq to bring out
the human rights issues more clearly. In particular you should note that we have
toned down the reference to aluminium tubes … and removed it from the Executive
Summary. This reflects some very recent exchanges on intelligence channels.
Finally, I have recast the conclusion to remove the chart, which a number of readers
considered to lack impact.”

205

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

492.  A concluding paragraph in the Executive Summary, stating that Saddam Hussein
would “use his weapons of mass destruction to protect and eventually project his power”,
reflected a revised Conclusions section at the end of the paper which stated:
“Four themes dominate even the most sober account of Saddam Hussein’s rule
in Iraq:

•	
•	
•	

Brutality … against his own people,

•	

Single minded pursuit of military power and above all weapons of mass
destruction as the most effective means of exercising that power.

Aggression against neighbour states,
Cynicism in dealing with the Iraqi people, regional states and the
International Community; and,

“This paper has set out our assessment of Saddam’s current holdings … as well as
his programmes for their development. Although our knowledge is partial, the paper
concludes that he possesses mass destruction weapons and the means to produce
them and to deliver them. His development programmes continue. An analysis of
what he will do with these weapons now and in the future, must rest upon his record
and our current information, including intelligence. It is reasonable to conclude that
he will use whatever weaponry he has to hand to protect his power and eventually
to project it when he feels strong enough to do so.”
493.  Other changes included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

the firming up of the judgement on the timeline for deploying chemical and
biological weapons, from “may be able” to deploy within 45 minutes to “are able”;
the addition of a statement that Iraq had learned lessons from its previous
experience with inspections to identify and exploit weak points and that sensitive
equipment and papers were easily concealed;
the addition of a statement that the “possession of mobile biological agent
production facilities” would “also aid concealment efforts”; and
the omission of the box explaining the difficulties of producing a nuclear weapon
and the inclusion of one which described the elements of a nuclear programme
and the process to convert those elements into a reliable weapon. The only
comment on the difficulty was that the complexity was “much greater for a
weapon that can fit into a missile warhead than for a larger Nagasaki-type
[free fall] bomb”.

494.  In an email to Mr Scarlett, Mr Campbell commented that he did not think the
revised Conclusion worked and that he would “either revert to, and strengthen” the
previous format (a box summarising key points), or drop the section.245 Mr Campbell
also wrote that the Foreword covered most of the points made in the Conclusion.
245 

Email Campbell to Scarlett, 19 September 2002, [untitled].

206

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

495.  In an email to Mr Campbell and Mr Scarlett on the afternoon of 19 September,
Mr Powell wrote that he agreed with Mr Campbell that the Conclusion should
be dropped.246
496.  Mr Powell also:

•	
•	

asked what headline “we want” in the Standard on the day of publication; and
pointed out that the statement that Saddam Hussein was “prepared to use
chemical and biological weapons if he believes his regime is under threat is a
bit of a problem”, because it backed up the argument that there was “no CBW
threat and we will only create one if we attack him”.

497.  Mr Powell added:
“My memory of the intelligence is that he has set up plans to use CBW on western
forces and that these weapons are integrated into his military planning.”
498.  In further comments later on 19 September, Mr Campbell raised three further
points in relation to nuclear weapons.247
499.  In relation to the time required to produce a nuclear weapon, the draft text
on nuclear timelines (paragraph 23) stated:
“In early 2002, the JIC assessed that UN sanctions on Iraq were hindering the import
of crucial goods for the production of fissile material. The JIC judged that while
sanctions remain effective, Iraq would not be able indigenously to produce a nuclear
weapon. If they were removed or proved ineffective, it would take Iraq at least five
years to produce a weapon. But we know that Iraq retains expertise and design data
relating to nuclear weapons. We therefore judge that if Iraq obtained fissile material
and other essential components from foreign sources, the timeline for production
of a nuclear weapon would be shortened and Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon
in between one and two years.”248
500.  Apologising for not having spotted the point earlier, Mr Campbell wrote:
“If we are saying that it would take between one and 2 years for them to build a
nuclear weapon by illegal means, why would it take 5 years with no sanctions? A lay
reader may assume that no sanctions would mean he could do what he wanted and
therefore, presumably, what he needed between 1 and 2 years
“If the answer is that it would take 5 years to go from planning to reality, whereas he
could purchase ready-made material from overseas, and so cut the timelines, I think
that should be made explicitly clear”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

501.  Secondly, Mr Campbell commented that the draft text on radiological dispersal
devices added little.
502.  Finally, Mr Campbell suggested that the text of the draft relating to attempts
to purchase two different machines which “could be used” in a gas centrifuge uranium
enrichment process (paragraph 21, fourth and fifth bullets), might be amended to read
“is required to”.249
503.  In his diaries on 19 September, Mr Campbell wrote:
“Most of my work at the moment was on the dossier. Nuclear timelines just about
sorted … I agreed to drop the conclusion. Some people reasonably convinced,
others not. We’d end up convincing those who wanted to be and not those
who didn’t.”250
504.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Hutton Inquiry that he “reported to my directors,
I think on 19 September that we had had full visibility of the process of preparing the
dossier and that the whole process had gone extremely well”.251

Preparation of Mr Blair’s Foreword
505.  The Foreword for the dossier was largely written by Mr Campbell, following
conversations with Mr Blair. It was produced in the week before publication
separately from the main text of the dossier.
506.  Mr Scarlett and the JIC were asked for comments.
507.  In comments on the Foreword in the draft dossier of 10 September,
Mr Pruce wrote:
“… the Foreword is good but whose voice is it? Do we need a Minister to sign
it off? Probably not”.252
508.  Mr Sedwill wrote that the Foreword needed to make Saddam Hussein’s defiance
of the UN “a key issue”.253 This was what distinguished him “from other dictators and
holders of WMD”.

509.  Mr Owen agreed with Mr Sedwill. He suggested that the Foreword needed:
“… to refer to the UN in the first sentences. This is after all, about the authority
of the UN and international law. This is the only way we can win the argument
in Parliament and elsewhere …”254
510.  Mr Straw suggested that the Foreword for the dossier “should be in a narrative
form” by Mr Blair, and that it needed “a killer” paragraph on “Saddam’s defiance of the
UN, only annexation of another member state and unprecedented use of WMD”.255
511.  Writing before the decision had been taken that Mr Blair would sign the Foreword
or the text had been drafted, Mr Bowen wrote:
“I take it as read that the Foreword is a political piece, signed by the Prime Minister
or another Minister. In that text it would be useful to make the point that what follows
is the work of officials drawing on sensitive intelligence material. The Foreword
can be as loaded as we like in terms of the political message (provided it is
consistent with the dossier itself), whereas the text itself should be the judgement
of the experts.”256
512.  The minute was copied to Mr Campbell, Mr Powell and Sir David Manning.
513.  Mr Campbell produced a draft Foreword for Mr Blair on 16 September.257
The draft began:
“The document published today is the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee …”
514.  Referring to the intelligence which had “formed the judgements” in the dossier,
the draft stated:
“I and other Ministers have been briefed in detail on the sources, and are satisfied
as to their authority, and the authority of the information they have disclosed.
“What I believe they established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to
produce chemical and biological weapons that he continues in his efforts to develop
nuclear weapons, and to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme.
“This picture … has become more not less worrying. Faced with the picture put
before me on seeing a succession of JIC papers on the subject, as Prime Minister
I have a choice: do I ignore this evidence or do I act to address the threat?

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“I am in no doubt that the threat is serious, and current; and that he has made
progress on WMD and that he has to be stopped.”
515.  The draft concluded:
“The case I make is not that Saddam could launch a nuclear attack on London or
another part of the UK (He could not). The case I make is that the UN resolution[s]
demanding he stops his WMD programme are being flouted; that since the
inspectors left four years ago, he has continued with this programme; and the
inspectors must be allowed in to do their job properly.
“It is the minimum necessary to ensure that he does not get to use the weapons
he has, or get hold of the weapons he wants.”
516.  A draft was sent to Mr Powell and Sir David Manning on 17 September, asking
for comments as soon as possible before it was shown to Mr Blair or Mr Scarlett.258
517.  Mr Powell offered three comments on the Foreword:

•	

•	

•	

“I think it is worth explicitly stating, as TB keeps saying, this is the advice to
him from the JIC. On the basis of this advice what other action could he as
PM take. Something like ‘I am today taking the exceptional step of publishing
the JIC’s advice to me because I want MPs and the British public to see the
advice on which I am acting. When you have read this I ask you to consider
what else a responsible PM could do than follow the course we have in the
face of the advice?’”
“We need to do more to back up the assertions. We cannot of course publish
the detailed raw intelligence on which this report is based without endangering
the lives of agents. But all the statements in this report are backed up by detailed
intelligence reports, the veracity and sources of which have been verified by
the intelligence agencies. Is there any independent verification we can cite?”
“In the penultimate para you need to make it clear Saddam could not attack
us at the moment. The thesis is he would be a threat to the UK in the future
if we do not check him.”259

518.  When Mr Campbell sent his and Mr Blair’s comments on the draft dossier
to Mr Scarlett on 17 September, he also asked Mr Scarlett for his views on the
draft Foreword.260

519.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair:
“… has also read my draft Foreword, which I enclose (he will want another look
at it before finally signing it off but I’d appreciate your views at this stage).”
520.  The draft Foreword was sent to Mr Scarlett by Mr Campbell’s office.261
521.  The original version of the final paragraph had been amended to read:
“I believe that faced with the information given to me by the JIC in recent months,
the UK Government has been right to support the demands that this issue be
confronted and dealt with. We must ensure that he does not get to use the weapons
he has, or get hold of the weapons he wants.”
522.  Mr Scarlett sent suggested changes to the draft Foreword to Mr Campbell
on 18 September.262 The changes included:

•	
•	
•	

•	
•	
•	

The first sentence was revised to state: “The document published today is
based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which
is chaired by the Cabinet Office …”
The second sentence of the second paragraph was revised to make clear that
it was the Government, not the JIC, which was publishing the document.
The fifth sentence of the fourth paragraph was amended to remove the reference
to Mr Blair and Ministers having been briefed on the sources of intelligence
and having been satisfied as to the authority of their information. It was
amended to state: “I and other Ministers have been briefed in detail on the
intelligence and are satisfied as to its authority.”
A new final sentence was added to the fifth paragraph stating: “I also believe
that, as stated in the document, Saddam will now do his utmost to try to conceal
his weapons from the UN inspectors.”
A new final sentence was added to the eighth paragraph stating: “I am quite
clear that he will go to extreme lengths, indeed has already done so, to avoid
giving them up.”
The reference to information from the JIC “in recent months”, in the first
sentence of the final paragraph, was replaced by the words “over the past
three years”.

523.  Mr Scarlett also wrote:
“For me the key points are the references to the JIC and the use of intelligence.
I am now seeking views of JIC colleagues on this amended text and will revert as
soon as possible.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

524.  The same version of the Foreword was sent to members of the JIC with the
following message from Mr Scarlett:
“This is under active discussion now and reflects amendments I have made. The aim
is to have the text agreed by close of play today. Please come ready to discuss at
this afternoon’s JIC meeting.”263
525.  The Government has been unable to find the original document but an email
to Sir David Omand and Mr Miller indicates that it was dispatched late morning on
18 September.264
526.  Mr Campbell informed Mr Scarlett on 18 September that Mr Blair had “signed
off” the Foreword, and that it incorporated “all the points you made on the draft I sent
yesterday”.265
527.  Sir David Omand responded to Mr Scarlett on 18 September:
“Coming on well. You will have more than enough comment. Highlighted on the
attached copy are a few suggested polishings.”266
528.  The changes proposed by Sir David included amending:

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	

the text in the first sentence of the first paragraph, to read: “… in large part,
on secret intelligence, as assessed by the Joint Intelligence Committee …”;
the third paragraph to read: “In recent months, I have been increasingly alarmed
by the evidence from inside Iraq that despite sanctions, despite the damage
done to his capability in the past, and despite the UNSCRs expressly outlawing
it, and despite his denials, Saddam Hussein is continuing to develop WMD …”;
the fifth paragraph by replacing the words “the JIC reports to me have” in the
first sentence with the words “the assessed intelligence has”;
the eighth paragraph by replacing the reference in the second sentence to
Saddam Hussein seeing “possession of WMD” as vital to his strategic interests
with the phrase “building up of his WMD capability”, and adding a reference
in the final sentence to hiding weapons as one of the ways to avoid giving
them up; and
the final paragraph by replacing the reference to information given to Mr Blair
by the JIC over the last three years with a reference to the information “available”
to Mr Blair.

529.  Sir David Omand told the Inquiry that he did not recall the JIC discussing the text
of the Foreword at its meeting on 18 September.267
530.  Mr Webb recorded that he had asked for the reference to [JIC] “papers” in the
draft to be replaced by “work”, “to reduce the risk of a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act]
action succeeding”.268
531.  The Inquiry has not seen comments from any JIC members other than Sir David
Omand and Mr Webb.
532.  Sir David told the Inquiry that he had “highlighted bits that needed polishing” and
“sent it back” to Mr Scarlett.269 Some of his comments had been incorporated and some
had not.
533.  Comparison of the draft texts shows that almost all Sir David Omand’s comments
were reflected in a further version of the draft Foreword sent by Mr Scarlett to
Mr Campbell on 19 September.270
534.  Mr Campbell replied to Mr Scarlett on 19 September:
“Re the foreword, I don’t like the first sentence which makes him sound a bit
James Bond-y. Can we discuss?”271
535.  In the published version of the Foreword, the first sentence did not include
Sir David Omand’s proposed amendment.272
536.  Mr Scarlett sent a “final draft version of the dossier” to Mr Campbell on
20 September.273 He wrote that the Prime Minister’s Foreword was “now incorporated
within the overall document”.
537.  In his letter to Mr Blair of 4 June 2003, Mr Scarlett wrote:
“The Foreword was drafted by you. I and some JIC members, commented on your
draft before it was finalised.”274

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

538.  In a letter to Mr Tam Dalyell on 16 July 2003, Mr Blair wrote:
“I have always made it clear that the Foreword was signed by me and was separate
to the Executive Summary and the body of the text of the … dossier …
…
“The Foreword was put to the Chairman of the JIC who confirmed at the time that
there was nothing which conflicted with the contents of the dossier.”275
539.  Asked whether he had drafted the Foreword, Mr Campbell told the ISC that
normally he, “Jonathan Powell and others would have ideas and we’d probably have a
discussion with the Prime Minister”.276 In relation to the Foreword in the dossier, Mr Blair
had been “very ‘hands on’ in terms of what was produced and what was sent … to
John Scarlett”.
540.  Mr Scarlett told the ISC that he had checked and amended the draft Foreword “for
factual accuracy and consistency with the text”, but he regarded it “as a policy statement
by the Prime Minister”.277
541.  Mr Campbell told the Hutton Inquiry that he had “prepared a draft [of the Foreword]
based upon a discussion with the Prime Minister, and with others, about what should go
into that draft”.278
542.  Asked about how the Foreword had been produced, Mr Blair told the Hutton
Inquiry:
“… as I say in my statement … I would have told Alastair Campbell what are the
items I think that are important, specific points that should be in it, on the basis of
the drafts produced … I should say at this point that probably my statement [to
Parliament on 24 September] was the thing I was concentrating most upon.”279
543.  In his subsequent evidence to the Hutton Inquiry, Mr Campbell confirmed
that the Foreword had been drafted on the basis of a discussion with Mr Blair and
Mr Campbell’s colleagues.280
544.  Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had:
“… said in terms intelligence can’t give you the whole picture, intelligence
is not necessarily always going to be right, but the intelligence he saw …
and as it was explained to him and as he had repeated discussions and

meetings about it, it led him to the conclusion, as he set out in the Foreword,
that he did believe it was established beyond doubt that Saddam had continued
to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continued to put his
efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he has been able to extend the
range of his ballistic missile programme, and he sees WMD as essential to his
political survival.”281
545.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry that he did not recall seeing the Foreword.282

The final version of the dossier
546.  Mr Scarlett sent a “final draft version of the dossier” to Mr Campbell on
20 September.283 He wrote that he had taken account of additional comments received
over the last 24 hours, and that he was:
“… content that the text now reflects as fully and accurately as possible the
intelligence picture on Saddam’s mass destruction weapons.”
547.  Copies of the minute and draft dossier were sent to Mr Powell, Sir David Manning,
Sir David Omand and “JIC Members”.
548.  The draft included Mr Blair’s Foreword. Other changes from the previous
draft included:

•	
•	

the omission of the Conclusions section;

•	
•	

removal of the reference to RDDs; and

amendment of the text on nuclear timelines to clarify that “while sanctions
remain effective Iraq would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon. If they
were removed or prove ineffective, it would take Iraq at least five years to
produce sufficient fissile material for a weapon indigenously”;
omission of the phrase “if he believes his regime is under threat”, in relation
to the statement that Saddam Hussein would be willing to use chemical and
biological weapons.

549.  The text in the published version relating to machines which could be used
in a gas centrifuge process was not changed.
550.  In response to questioning about his decision to omit the qualifying phrase
in relation to Saddam Hussein only using chemical and biological weapons if his
regime was under attack, and the impact of that omission on the perception of the
threat, Mr Scarlett told Lord Hutton that the change “was as a result of the exercise

of my professional judgement and that of my colleagues in [the] Assessment Staff”.284
They had been “prompted to look again” at that passage by Mr Powell’s email, of
19 September, in the context of the “instructions from the JIC to keep what we were
writing in line with standing JIC assessments and also with recent intelligence”:
“When we looked at it again, we realised … that there was no standing JIC
assessment which made it clear whether we were defining Saddam’s threat …
or CW posture … as defensive or offensive. More to the point, there was recent
reporting, in addition, which was not reflected here, but which was quite clear
reporting, which placed his attachment to CBW and the importance that he placed
on it very much in the context of his perception of his regional position, his plan to
acquire and maintain regional influence and, as one report, and maybe more, put
it: to dominate his neighbours. In other words, the recent intelligence was more
complex … Bearing those points in mind, we concluded that this was not right and
therefore we took that out.”
551.  Mr Webb sent Mr Hoon a copy of the draft dossier on 20 September, advising that
it had been “given an extremely restricted circulation (essentially JIC members only)”
and that he had “no discretion to copy this document further”.285 Arrangements were
being made to brief Opposition leaders, Select Committee chairs and junior ministers
on 23 September before the debate on 24 September, and key allies.
552.  Mr Webb told Mr Hoon that AM French’s staff had been “closely associated with
the preparation of the detail of the dossier” and he understood they were “content from
a professional DIS point of view with the judgements” it contained. The paragraphs on
the acquisition of aluminium tubes and nuclear timelines were “more cautious” than
US Department of Defence views and no consultation with the US was planned
“outside intelligence and White House channels”.
553.  Mr Webb concluded that he had:
“… some reservations as a JIC member about citing the Committee’s views explicitly
(lest we become less usefully direct in our future judgements) but the way this has
been achieved has reassured me.
“Overall I am content to recommend the material …”
554.  The record of Mr Scarlett’s meeting at 1300 on 20 September stated that copies
of the dossier would be made available for Cabinet on 23 September.286

555.  Mr Blair had “committed” Mr Scarlett to provide “an intelligence briefing” for the
Chairs of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Select Committees and the Intelligence and
Security Committee in the week of 16 September.287
556.  In a minute to Mr Blair in June 2003, Mr Scarlett wrote:
“As is natural in the JIC drafting process, there was a debate about a number
of issues … but agreement was reached on the final text …”288
557.  Mr Scarlett also wrote:
“The JIC agreed that all intelligence-based sections in the document would be
submitted to it before they were finalised. The draft assessment was discussed
at the JIC on 11 and 18 September. The final draft was circulated to JIC
members on 19 September and subsequently agreed by them. It was sent to me
by Alastair Campbell on 20 September289 … I regarded this as the formal moment
at which I was taking responsibility for its contents. I noted to Alastair that the
draft Conclusion … which had been drafted by me and formed part of earlier
versions of the document, had been dropped. I regarded it as superfluous.”
558.  Mr Scarlett added:
“At no stage in the drafting process set out above was there an attempt, from No.10
or elsewhere, to overrule the judgements of the JIC or my judgement as the person
in charge.”290
559.  Mr Scarlett stated that the minute had been seen by his colleagues on the JIC.

Iraq’s denial that it had weapons of mass destruction
Iraq informed Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, on 16 September that it had
decided to allow the return of inspectors and that it was ready to discuss the practical
arrangements with the UN.291
In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 19 September, Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi
Foreign Minister, offered Iraq’s “condolences to the American people, especially the
families of the victims” of the 11 September 2001 attacks and told the Security Council that
he had been instructed by President Saddam Hussein to convey excerpts from his letter to
the General Assembly, which presented “Iraq’s position on the latest developments in the
relationship between Iraq and the Security Council”.292

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

In the letter, Saddam Hussein declared that Iraq was “totally clear of all nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons”; and challenged President Bush’s “insinuation” that Iraq was
linked to the attacks on 9/11 and international terrorism.
Iraq’s position in its letters and statements to the UN, and the UK responses, are
addressed in more detail in Section 3.5.

Mr Blair’s Foreword
560.  In the Foreword to the dossier, Mr Blair emphasised Iraq’s WMD capabilities
and the potential threat they posed.293 The full text of the Foreword is set out in the
Box below. The Inquiry has highlighted in bold text the points it regards as particularly
important in relation to the assessment of Iraq WMD capabilities and intent.

Mr Blair’s Foreword to the 24 September dossier
The document published today is based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence
Committee (JIC). The JIC is at the heart of the British intelligence machinery. It is
chaired by the Cabinet Office and made up of the heads of the UK’s three Intelligence
and Security Agencies, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, and senior officials from key
government departments. For over 60 years the JIC has provided regular assessments
to successive Prime Ministers and senior colleagues on a wide range of foreign policy
and international security issues.294
Its work, like the material it analyses, is largely secret. It is unprecedented for the
Government to publish this kind of document but in the light of the debate about Iraq
and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), I wanted to share with the British public
the reasons why I believe this issue to be a current and serious threat to the UK
national interest.
In recent months, I have been increasingly alarmed by the evidence from inside Iraq
that despite sanctions, despite the damage done to his capability in the past, despite
the UN Security Council resolutions expressly outlawing it, and despite his denials,
Saddam Hussein is continuing to develop WMD, and with them the ability to inflict
real damage on the region, and the stability of the world.
Gathering intelligence from inside Iraq is not easy. Saddam’s is one of the most secretive
and dictatorial regimes in the world. So I believe people will understand why the
Agencies cannot be specific about the sources, which have formed the judgements
in this document, and why we cannot publish everything we know. We cannot, of
course, publish the detailed raw intelligence. I and other Ministers have been briefed in
detail on the intelligence and are satisfied as to its authority. I also want to pay tribute
to our Intelligence and Security Services for the often extraordinary work that they do.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that
Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he
continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he has been able
to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme. I also believe that, as stated
in the document, Saddam will now do his utmost to try to conceal his weapons from
UN inspectors.
The picture presented to me by the JIC in recent months has become more not
less worrying. It is clear that, despite sanctions, the policy of containment has not
worked sufficiently well to prevent Saddam from developing these weapons.
I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current, that he has made progress
on WMD, and that he has to be stopped.
Saddam has used chemical weapons, not only against an enemy state, but against his
own people. Intelligence reports make clear that he sees the building up of his WMD
capability, and the belief overseas that he would use these weapons, as vital to
his strategic interests, and in particular his goal of regional domination. And the
document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be
ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.
I am quite clear that Saddam will go to extreme lengths, indeed has already done
so, to hide these weapons and avoid giving them up.
In today’s interdependent world, a major regional conflict does not stay confined to the
region in question. Faced with someone who has shown himself capable of using WMD,
I believe the international community has to stand up for itself and ensure its authority
is upheld.
The threat posed to international peace and security, when WMD are in the hands
of a brutal and aggressive regime like Saddam’s, is real. Unless we face up to the
threat, not only do we risk undermining the authority of the UN, whose resolutions
he defies, but more importantly and in the longer term, we place at risk the lives and
prosperity of our own people.
The case I make is that the UN resolutions demanding he stops his WMD programme
are being flouted; that since the inspectors left four years ago, he has continued with
this programme; that the inspectors must be allowed back in to do their job properly; and
that if he refuses, or if he makes it impossible for them to do their job, as he has done in
the past, the international community will have to act.
I believe that faced with the information available to me, the UK Government has been
right to support the demands that this issue be confronted and dealt with. We must ensure
that he does not get to use the weapons he has, or get hold of the weapons he wants.

Key points in the dossier
561.  As discussed by the JIC on 11 September, the dossier highlighted the
contribution which recent intelligence had made to the assessment of Iraq’s
activity since 1998 and on Saddam Hussein’s readiness to deploy and use
chemical and biological weapons.

219

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

562.  The Executive Summary of the Iraq dossier stated that, in addition to the public
evidence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, the Government
had “significant additional information … from secret intelligence sources” which,
although it could not “tell us about everything”, provided “a fuller picture of Iraqi plans
and capabilities”.295
563.  In the chapter on the role of intelligence, the dossier stated that intelligence had
“provided important insights into Iraqi programmes and Iraqi military thinking”, and that:
“Taken together with what is already known from other sources, this intelligence
builds our understanding of Iraq’s capabilities and adds significantly to the analysis
in the public domain.”
564.  The dossier stated that the chapter on the current position set out “what we know
of Saddam Hussein’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes,
drawing on all the available evidence”.296 It drew “heavily on the latest intelligence about
Iraqi efforts to develop their programmes and capabilities since 1998” to support a list
of “main conclusions”, including that Saddam Hussein continued:
“… to attach great importance to the possession of weapons of mass destruction
and ballistic missiles which he regards as being the basis for Iraq’s regional power.
He is determined to retain these capabilities …”
CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS
565.  The dossier stated that, by 1991, Iraq had produced more than 16,000 free-fall
bombs and more than 110,000 artillery rockets and shells for the delivery of chemical
and biological agents.297 It had also admitted to having 50 chemical and 25 biological
warheads available for ballistic missiles.
566.  UNSCOM had destroyed 30 of the warheads filled with chemical agents.298 It had
also destroyed chemical munitions, agent and precursors and biological seed stocks and
growth media, and dismantled or destroyed chemical and biological production facilities.
567.  The dossier challenged Iraq’s claims that chemical agents produced before 1991
would have deteriorated sufficiently to render them harmless and that it had destroyed
all its biological weapons and agent.299

568.  Addressing the chemical and biological weapons and material Iraq might have
produced or obtained, which UNSCOM had been unable to account for when it left, the
dossier quoted the figures given to Parliament by Mr Straw on 2 May 2002, including
“over 30,000 special munitions for delivery of chemical and biological agents.300 It added:
“The departure of UNSCOM meant that the international community was unable to
establish the truth behind these large discrepancies and greatly diminished its ability
to monitor and assess Iraq’s continuing attempts to reconstitute its programmes.”
569.  In respect of chemical and biological weapons, the Executive Summary stated:
“As a result of that intelligence, we judge that Iraq has:

•	
•	

continued to produce chemical and biological agents;

•	

command and control arrangements in place to use chemical and biological
weapons. Authority ultimately resides with Saddam Hussein. (There is
intelligence that he may have delegated this authority to his son Qusay);

•	
•	

military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including
against its own Shia population. Some of these weapons are deployable
within 45 minutes of an order to use them;

developed mobile laboratories for military use, corroborating earlier reports
about the mobile production of biological warfare agents;
pursued illegal programmes to procure controlled material of potential use
in the production of chemical and biological weapons programmes …”301

570.  In its “main conclusions”, the dossier stated:

•	
•	
•	

“Iraq has a usable chemical and biological weapons capability … which has
included recent production of chemical and biological agents.”
“Iraq can deliver chemical and biological agents using an extensive range
of artillery shells, free-fall bombs, sprayers and ballistic missiles.”
“Iraq’s military forces are able to use chemical and biological weapons, with
command, control and logistical arrangements in place. The Iraqi military are
able to deploy these weapons within 45 minutes of a decision to do so.”302

571.  In the main text, the dossier stated that the JIC had, in the last six months,
“confirmed its earlier judgements on Iraqi chemical and biological warfare capabilities
and assessed that Iraq has the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons”.303

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

572.  In a section on “Recent Intelligence”, the dossier stated:
“Subsequently intelligence has become available from reliable sources which
complements and adds to previous intelligence and confirms the JIC assessment
that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons. The intelligence also shows that the
Iraqi leadership has been discussing a number of issues related to these weapons.
This intelligence covers:

•	

•	

•	

Confirmation that chemical and biological weapons play an important
role in Iraqi military thinking: intelligence shows that Saddam attaches
great importance to the possession of chemical and biological weapons
which he regards as being the basis for Iraqi regional power. He believes
that respect for Iraq rests on its possession of these weapons and the
missiles capable of delivering them. Intelligence indicates that Saddam is
determined to retain this capability and recognises that Iraqi political weight
would be diminished if Iraq’s military power rested solely on its conventional
military forces.
Iraq’s attempts to retain its existing banned weapon systems:
Iraq is already taking steps to prevent the UN weapons inspectors finding
evidence of its chemical and biological weapons programme. Intelligence
indicates that Saddam has learnt lessons from previous weapons
inspections, has identified possible weak points in the inspections process
and knows how to exploit them. Sensitive equipment and papers can easily
be concealed and in some cases this is already happening. The possession
of mobile biological agent production facilities will also aid concealment
efforts. Saddam is determined not to lose the capabilities that he has been
able to develop further in the four years since inspectors left.
Saddam’s willingness to use chemical and biological weapons:
intelligence indicates that as part of Iraq’s military planning Saddam is willing
to use chemical and biological weapons, including against his own Shia
population. Intelligence indicates that the Iraqi military are able to deploy
chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so.”304

573.  In a section on “Chemical agent: production facilities”, the dossier stated:
“Intelligence shows that Iraq has continued to produce chemical agent.”305
574.  In a similar section on “Biological agent: production facilities”, the dossier
stated: “We know from intelligence that Iraq has continued to produce biological
warfare agents.”306

222

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

575.  The dossier also stated:
“UNSCOM established that Iraq considered the use of mobile biological agent
production facilities. In the past two years evidence from defectors has indicated the
existence of such facilities. Recent intelligence confirms that the Iraqi military have
developed mobile facilities.”307
576.  Summarising the section on chemical and biological weapons, the dossier stated:
“Intelligence shows that Iraq has covert chemical and biological weapons
programmes … and has continued to produce chemical and biological agents.
Iraq has:

•	
•	
•	
•	

chemical and biological weapons available, both from pre-Gulf War stocks
and more recent production;
the capability to produce the chemical agents …
a biological agent production capability … Iraq has also developed mobile
facilities to produce biological agents;
…”308

NUCLEAR WEAPONS
577.  The dossier stated that Iraq’s aim pre-1991 “was to produce a missile warhead
with a 20-kiloton yield and weapons designs were produced for the simplest implosion
weapons”.309 Iraq had pursued a number of programmes to produce highly enriched
uranium, for the warhead. The enrichment programmes had made little progress
before the Gulf Conflict, but the nuclear programme was supported by a large body of
expertise, programme documentation and databases and manufacturing infrastructure.
578.  In respect of nuclear weapons, the Executive Summary stated:
“Iraq had:

•	
•	
•	

tried covertly to acquire technology and materials which could be used in the
production of nuclear weapons;
sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having no active
civil nuclear power programme that could require it;
recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme”.310

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

579.  In its “main conclusions”, the dossier stated:
“Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons … Uranium has been sought
from Africa that has no civil nuclear application …”311
580.  The dossier stated that the JIC assessed that Iraq had continued its nuclear
research after 1998 and “drew attention to intelligence that Iraq had recalled its nuclear
scientists to the programme in 1998”. “Since 1998 Iraq had been trying to procure items
that could be for use in the construction of centrifuges …”312
581.  In a section on “Iraq’s nuclear weapons expertise”, the dossier stated:

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

The IAEA had dismantled the physical infrastructure of Iraq’s nuclear weapons
and removed the remaining highly enriched uranium, “But Iraq retained, and
retains many of its experienced nuclear scientists and technicians who are
specialised in the production of fissile material and weapon design. Intelligence
indicates that Iraq also retains the accompanying programme documentation
and data.”
“Intelligence shows that the present Iraqi programme is almost certainly seeking
an indigenous capability to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon …”
“Following the departure of the inspectors in 1998 there has been an
accumulation of intelligence indicating that Iraq is making concerted covert
efforts to acquire dual-use technology and material with nuclear applications.”
“Iraq’s known holdings of processed uranium are under IAEA supervision.
But there is intelligence that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities
of uranium from Africa. Iraq has no … legitimate reason to acquire uranium.”
Intelligence showed that Iraq had attempted to purchase other items that could
be used in a nuclear programme, including “repeated attempts covertly to
acquire a very large quantity (60,000 or more) of specialised aluminium tubes”
with a “potential application in the construction of gas centrifuges used to enrich
uranium, although there is no definitive intelligence that it is destined for a
nuclear programme”.313

582.  The judgements in the dossier about the timelines Iraq would need to acquire
a nuclear weapon are addressed earlier in this Section.

BALLISTIC MISSILES
583.  In respect of ballistic missiles, the Executive Summary stated:
“As a result of that intelligence, we judge that Iraq has:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

illegally retained up to 20 Al Hussein missiles, with a range of 650km,
capable of carrying chemical or biological warheads;
started deploying its Al Samoud liquid propellant missile, and has used the
absence of weapons inspectors to work on extending its range to at least
200km …
started producing the … Ababil-100, and is making efforts to extend its range
to at least 200km …
constructed a new engine test stand for the development of missiles capable
of reaching the UK Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus and NATO members
(Greece and Turkey), as well as all Iraq’s Gulf neighbours and Israel;
pursued illegal programmes to procure materials for use in its illegal
development of long-range missiles …”314

584.  In its “main conclusions”, the dossier stated:
“Iraq possesses extended-range versions of the SCUD ballistic missile … which are
capable of reaching Cyprus, Eastern Turkey, Tehran and Israel. It is also developing
longer-range missiles …”315
585.  The dossier stated that the JIC:

•	
•	

drew attention in mid-2001 to a “step change” in progress on Iraq’s missile
programme over the preceding two years, and that “work was under way
on larger engines for longer-range missiles”; and
concluded in early 2002 that “Iraq had begun to develop missiles with a range
of over 1,000kms”, but it assessed that “if sanctions remained effective”, Iraq
“would not be able to produce such a missile before 2007”.

586.  In a section on Iraq’s ballistic missile programme since 1998, the dossier stated:

•	
•	
•	

Iraq had retained up to 20 Al Hussein missiles that “could be used with
conventional, chemical or biological warheads and, with a range of 650km are
capable of reaching a number of countries in the region including Cyprus”.
“Intelligence has confirmed that Iraq wants to extend the range of its missiles
systems to over 1,000km, enabling it to threaten other regional neighbours.”
“Iraq’s missile programmes employ hundreds of people.”

225

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	

The engine test facility being constructed at al-Rafah would “be capable of
testing engines” with ranges over 1,000km and “would not be needed” for
systems within the 150km permitted range.
Iraq had “managed to rebuild much of the missile production infrastructure”
destroyed in 1991 and 1998 and new missile-related infrastructure was “under
construction”.
“Despite a UN embargo, Iraq has also made concerted efforts to acquire
additional production technology …”316

FUNDING FOR THE WMD PROGRAMME
587.  The Executive Summary of the dossier stated that Iraq had an illegal income
of some US$3bn from “illicit earnings generated outside UN control”.317
588.  The dossier acknowledged that the proportion of those funds that was used
to develop or acquire military equipment was unknown, but stated:
“… we have seen no evidence that Iraqi attempts to develop its weapons of mass
destruction and its ballistic missile programme … has been inhibited in any way by
lack of funds. The steady increase [in illicit funds] over the last three years in the
availability of funds will enable Saddam to progress the programmes faster.”

Questions about the judgements in the dossier
589.  The judgements expressed in the dossier and how they were reached have
already been examined by the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Intelligence and
Security Committee (ISC) and Inquiries led by Lord Hutton and Lord Butler.
590.  The report of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), The
Decision to go to War in Iraq (HC 813-1), was published on 7 July 2003.318 It sought
to “establish whether the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), within the
Government as a whole, presented accurate and complete information to Parliament
in the period leading up to military action in Iraq, particularly in respect of weapons of
mass destruction”.
591.  The report of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), Iraqi Weapons
of Mass Destruction – Intelligence and Assessments (Cm 5972), was published in

September 2003.319 The ISC stated that it had “looked at the supporting intelligence in
critical areas to ensure that the [JIC] Assessments reflected the intelligence correctly”.
592.  The Report of the Inquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Death of
Dr David L Kelly CMG by Lord Hutton (“The Hutton Inquiry”, HC 247), was published on
28 January 2004.320
593.  In relation to the question of whether the judgements were improperly influenced
by Mr Campbell or No.10, Lord Hutton concluded:
“Mr Campbell made it clear to Mr Scarlett on behalf of the Prime Minister that
10 Downing Street wanted the dossier to be worded to make as strong a case
as possible in relation to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s WMD, and
10 Downing Street made written suggestions to Mr Scarlett as to changes in 
the wording of the draft dossier which would strengthen it. But Mr Campbell
recognised, and told Mr Scarlett that 10 Downing Street recognised, that nothing
should be stated in the dossier with which the intelligence community were not
entirely happy.
“Mr Scarlett accepted some of the drafting amendments suggested to him by
10 Downing Street but he only accepted those suggestions which were consistent
with the intelligence known to the JIC and he rejected those suggestions which were
not consistent with such intelligence and the dossier … was approved by the JIC.
“As the dossier was one to be presented to, and read by, Parliament and the
public … I do not consider that it was improper for Mr Scarlett and the JIC to take
into account suggestions as to drafting made by 10 Downing Street and to adopt
those suggestions if they were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC.
However I consider that the possibility cannot be completely ruled out that the desire
of the Prime Minister to have a dossier which, whilst consistent with the available
intelligence, was as strong as possible in relation to the threat posed by Saddam
Hussein’s WMD, may have subconsciously influenced Mr Scarlett and other
members of the JIC to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than
it would have been if it had been contained in a normal JIC Assessment. Although
this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, I am satisfied that Mr Scarlett, the
other members of the JIC, and the members of the Assessment Staff engaged in
the drafting of the dossier were concerned to ensure that the contents of the dossier
were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC.
“The term ‘sexed-up’ is a slang expression, the meaning of which lacks clarity in
the context of the discussion of the dossier. It is capable of two different meanings.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

It could mean that the dossier was embellished with items of intelligence known
or believed to be false or unreliable … or it could mean … that the dossier was
drafted in such a way as to make the case against Saddam Hussein as strong
as the intelligence contained in it permitted. If the term is used in this latter sense,
then because of the drafting suggestions made by 10 Downing Street for the
purpose of making a strong case against Saddam Hussein, it could be said that the
Government ‘sexed up’ the dossier. However … I consider that the allegation … that
the dossier had been embellished with intelligence known or believed to be false or
unreliable, which was not the case.”321
594.  The Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction by a Committee
of Privy Counsellors chaired by Lord Butler of Brockwell (“The Butler Report”, HC 8980),
was published on 14 July 2004.322
595.  Describing the purpose of the dossier, the Butler Report stated:
“… the dossier was not intended to make the case for a particular course of action
in relation to Iraq. It was intended by the Government to promote domestic and
international understanding of, and gain support for, the general direction in which
Government policy had been moving since the early months of 2002, away from
containment to a more proactive approach to enforcing Iraqi disarmament.”323
596.  The Butler Report also stated:

•	
•	

“The Government wanted a document on which it could draw in its advocacy
of its policy. The JIC sought to offer a dispassionate assessment of intelligence
and other material on Iraqi nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile
programmes.”324
“… the language of the dossier may have left with readers the impression
that there was fuller and firmer intelligence behind the judgements
than was the case: our view, having reviewed all of the material, is that
judgements in the dossier went to (although not beyond) the outer limits
of the intelligence available. The Prime Minister’s description in his statement
to the House of Commons … [on 24 September] of the picture painted by the
intelligence services in the dossier as ‘extensive, detailed and authoritative’ may
have reinforced this impression.”325

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

597.  The Iraq Inquiry has drawn on the evidence offered to those Inquiries, and their
analysis and conclusions, in reaching a view on the aspects of the dossier addressed
in the following paragraphs.

Defence Intelligence Staff concerns
598.  During the drafting of the dossier, questions were raised by staff in the DIS
about the basis for the judgements on Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons
capabilities and its intent to use chemical and biological weapons.
599.  The DIS comments on the draft dossier on 17 September, expressing concerns
that some of the statements on chemical and biological weapons in the draft could not
be substantiated by the intelligence seen by the DIS, which were discussed in Mr Miller’s
meeting that morning, are set out earlier in this Section.
600.  Mr Miller confirmed that no minute was taken of the meeting.326
601.  Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the DIS comments had been discussed
by the formal drafting group on 17 September and that:
“They were dealt with within that process and they were not brought forward by the
DIS senior management to the level of the JIC.”327
602.  Mr Cragg told the Hutton Inquiry that, at the meeting on 17 September, “it was
agreed that the SIS representative would make further representations” to the DIS
about the “very tightly held intelligence [the report of 11 September]” and that the SIS
representative had spoken to Dr Paul Roper, DIS Director of Science and Technology,
and told him that “SIS believed it was good intelligence”.328
603.  Mr Cragg told Lord Hutton that it was reported to him that the concern about
the discontinuity between the main text of the dossier and the Executive Summary
had been:
“… put … down to the fact that the Executive Summary pulled together or reflected
not merely recent intelligence which was … contained in the main text, but also
the general context of the new intelligence which had been received, such as the
knowledge, which we had had for many years, of the capabilities of the Iraqis in their
use of chemical weapons and also our knowledge that they had commander control
arrangements for the use of these weapons in place.”329
604.  Mr Scarlett subsequently told the Hutton Inquiry that, after the meeting
on 17 September, Mr Miller had reported the DIS concerns about the statements
on the production of “CW agent”, because it related to “the existence of additional

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

compartmented intelligence [the SIS report of 11 September]”, which had not been
seen by the DIS, “which was underpinning the judgement”.330 He had been told that
arrangements had been made to brief “DIS management” on the intelligence. Mr Scarlett
added that, in the absence of comment on that point in the DIS comments on the draft
dossier on 19 September, silence had been taken as assent.
605.  Sir John Scarlett told the Iraq Inquiry that he “was aware that there had been
questioning from within the DIS about the fact that they hadn’t seen the compartmented
[11 September] report”. He and Mr Miller had “agreed that it would be necessary” for the
DIS to be shown the report and, as far as he was concerned, “that happened” and there
was “no further awareness” on his part.331
606.  In a minute on 19 September to Dr Roper, Dr Brian Jones, the branch head of the
nuclear, biological and chemical section in the Scientific and Technical Directorate of the
Defence Intelligence Staff, wrote:
“1. … the generation of the Iraqi dossier which, in the last two weeks has
involved a number of iterations which have incorporated new intelligence. It is my
understanding that some of the intelligence has not been made available to my
branch. Because of this they have had to express their reservations on several
aspects of the dossier. Most of these have been resolved. However a number
remain … and it is important that I note for you at this stage the remaining areas
where we are unable to confirm the statements made on the basis of the information
available to my branch.
“2. Although we have no problem with a judgement based on intelligence that
Saddam attaches great importance to possessing WMD we have not seen the
intelligence that ‘shows’ this to be the case. Nor have we seen intelligence that
‘shows’ he does not regard them only as a weapon of last resort, although our
judgement is that it would be sensible to assume that he might use them in a
number of other scenarios. The intelligence we have seen indicates rather than
‘shows’ that Iraq has been planning to conceal its WMD capabilities, and it would
be … reasonable to assume that he would do this.
“3. We have a number of questions in our minds relating to the intelligence on
military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, particularly about the
times mentioned and the failure to differentiate between the two types of weapon.
“4. We have not seen intelligence which we believe ‘shows’ that Iraq has continued
to produce CW agent in 1998-2002, although our judgement is that it has probably
done so. Whilst we are even more convinced that Iraq has continued to produce
BW agent (on the basis of mobile production intelligence) we would not go so far
as to say that we ‘know’ this to be the case.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

“5. Finally … we are pleased that the claim that Iraq used aflatoxin against the Shia
uprising has been excluded from the dossier but we are concerned that the claim
in relation to mustard remains as we consider the evidence to be weak.”332
607.  Dr Jones sent a copy of his minute to the office of Mr Cragg and others in the
Defence Intelligence Staff.
608.  The following day, the chemical warfare expert in Dr Jones’ team wrote to Dr Roper
setting out in detail his concerns about aspects of the dossier.333
609.  In relation to the statement in the draft Foreword, that Mr Blair believed that the
“assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt” that “Saddam has continued to
produce chemical and biological weapons”, the minute stated:
“I acknowledge that in this statement the Prime Minister will be expressing his own
‘belief’ about what the assessed intelligence has established. What I wish to record
is that based on the intelligence available to me it has NOT established beyond
doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical [and biological] weapons.”
610.  Addressing the statement in the Foreword that “military planning allows for some
of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them”, and a “similar
statement” in the dossier, the minute stated:
“This is reported as a fact whereas the intelligence comes from a single source.
In my view the intelligence warrants no stronger a statement than ‘… intelligence
suggest that military planning allows …’”
611.  Addressing the judgement in paragraph 6 of the Executive Summary, that Iraq had
“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”, the minute stated:
“I have seen intelligence that suggests that production of chemical agents has
continued but in my judgement this warrants no stronger statement than ‘Iraq has …
probably continued to produce chemical [and biological] agents.’”
612.  Addressing the judgement in paragraph 6 of the Executive Summary, that “Some
of these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them”, the
minute stated:
“It is not clear what is meant … The judgement is too strong considering the
intelligence on which it is based.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

613.  In relation to statements in Chapter 3 of the dossier, the minute stated:

•	
•	

•	

Paragraph 1, first bullet: the “statement about ‘recent production of chemical
[and biological] agents’” could not “be supported” by the intelligence available
to the author.
Paragraph 5, first bullet: the author believed that the statement that “Intelligence
shows that Saddam attaches great importance to the possession of chemical
[and biological] weapons” was “far too strong” and “in contrast to other
statements in this paragraph which use the term ‘intelligence indicates that’
which is more balanced”.
Paragraph 8, first bullet: the intelligence available to the author warranted a
statement “no stronger” than “Iraq has probably continued to produce chemical
agent”, not the statement that “Intelligence shows that Iraq has continued to
produce chemical agent.”

614.  The minute was copied to Mr Cragg’s office and to Dr Jones.
615.  Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that the “problems” with the 45 minutes report of
30 August “fell into three categories”. The information was “second-hand”; it “did not
differentiate between … chemical … or … biological weapons”; and there was “a lack
of collateral intelligence”.334
616.  Dr Jones explained that the circumstances in which it would be important to deliver
biological weapons within 45 minutes “would be fairly special circumstances” and that
“had pushed us into thinking perhaps we were talking about chemical weapons”. It was
“easy” to put chemical and biological weapons:
“… together in a collective term … But there was an element of doubt coming into
our analysis … We would have looked, normally, for further definitions to feel really
comfortable …”
617.  Dr Jones also stated that they had been “worried” by the absence of evidence
relating to the production of chemical agents and that:
“We had not seen the weapons being produced. We had no evidence of any recent
testing or field trials … So that all cast some doubts in our mind on that particular
piece of intelligence.”
618.  Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that he thought the intelligence was “important” but the
references in the draft dossier were “too strong”. It was:
“… reasonable to say that the intelligence indicated that this was the case … but …
we did not think the intelligence showed it absolutely beyond any shadow of doubt.”

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

619.  Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that he had been informed of the concerns of his staff
about the statements on the “continued production of chemical and biological agents”;
and that there “was said to be additional intelligence that actually had it been available
to us would have removed those concerns”.335 He had discussed the issue with his
Director, Dr Roper. Dr Roper had not seen the intelligence but “a senior official from
one of the … agencies” had “suggested to him that the intelligence judgements that
were being made in the dossier were in fact okay because … they were supported
by the additional intelligence”. Dr Jones added that he had said the DIS should express
a reservation about the language.
620.  Dr Jones subsequently stated that his staff had “no evidence that significant
production had taken place either of chemical warfare agent or chemical weapons”.336
621.  Dr Jones also stated that the DIS had “not seen the weapons being produced.
We had no evidence of any recent testing or field trials …”337
622.  Asked what he had done following receipt of Dr Jones’ minute, Mr Cragg told
the Hutton Inquiry that he had:
“… taken the view that on the question of the 45 minutes and of the chemical
weapon production, this had already been considered at length with the Cabinet
Office in their meeting of 17 September and that I was satisfied with the decisions
reached and consequently with the wording of the dossier at that point. On the …
importance attached to the possession of chemical weapons, the absence of
proof … they are not seen … as weapons of last resort. And the absence of …
definitive proof, that efforts are being made to conceal them. I took the view on
each of those there had been much intelligence over the years, not merely in the
last few weeks … which sustained the view taken in the dossier.”338
623.  Asked whether Dr Jones’ minute of 19 September 2002 was “strong language
for intelligence personnel”, Mr Cragg replied:
“Yes. I was quite surprised to receive the minute because … we had tried to explain
what the situation was, certainly on the production issue and, as far as I can tell also
perhaps, although I am not certain, on the 45 minutes.”339
624.  Mr Cragg stated that he had “taken the view that since all the issues had either
been discussed with the Cabinet Office or were well within the general thrust of known
intelligence that it was not necessary to raise the issue with Mr Scarlett”.340

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

625.  Mr Cragg stated:
“… the dossier reflected the JIC Assessments on the recent intelligence; and the JIC
Assessments were an accurate reflection, put into context, of the intelligence itself.
So it was a flow of perfectly reputable intelligence conveyed by the Assessment Staff
and ourselves into the JIC Assessment and thence into the dossier.
…
“… I am quite sure … the dossier … does not go beyond … available intelligence.”341
626.  Mr Cragg stated that he had subsequently held a meeting with the Director
of Global Issues, the Director of Science and Technology and the DIS staff who had
attended the Assessment Staff meeting. He had been told, in relation to the 45 minute
intelligence:
“… firstly, on the actual detailed intelligence, recent intelligence underpinning the
main text and partly the Executive Summary, that the Secret Intelligence Service,
SIS, were satisfied that the source was established and reliable and … they
supported the reporting, which had already been included in a JIC Assessment
on 9 September.
…
“… My staff also reported … there had been a discussion … of the general context
in which the new intelligence had appeared which convinced them that it was quite
reasonable to take the line they did in Executive Summary concerning the likelihood
or the capability of the Iraqis to deploy weapons of mass destruction within
45 minutes of a decision to do so.
…
“… I understand from my staff that there was a discussion of the validity of the
source, which would almost certainly have included whether it was single source.”
627.  Mr Cragg added that a:
“… single source has to be looked at with some care; but this was a known
source, established and reliable with a good reporting record. And the statements
he was making, the intelligence he was providing was well in context of known
Iraqi approaches.
…
“So in that sense – I think Mr Scarlett said it fairly clearly – there were no qualms
about including this reporting.”

the Death of Dr David Kelly [“The Hutton Report”], paragraph 197.
341 

234

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

628.  AM French confirmed to the Hutton Inquiry that, having seen Dr Jones’ minute
of 19 September, he had been content with the dossier.342
629.  In response to a question about whether Mr Scarlett had “tightened” the language
in the dossier in the draft of 18 September, to take account of the points raised by
Mr Campbell in his minute of 17 September rather than the points raised by the DIS
the same day, Mr Cragg replied: “Yes.”343
630.  Asked about the way in which he had dealt with the comments provided by the DIS
and Mr Campbell on 17 September, Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the issues
raised by the DIS had been discussed in Mr Miller’s meeting before Mr Campbell’s
minute was received.344
631.  Mr Scarlett told Lord Hutton that the intelligence on weapons being available for use
within 45 minutes “came from an established and reliable source quoting a senior Iraqi
military officer in a position to know this information”.345 It had been “judged straight away
that the intelligence was consistent with established JIC judgements on the command
control and logistical arrangements and capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces … [F]or the
first time in our reporting it gave a particular time, gave some precision.”
632.  Mr Scarlett stated that:

•	
•	

It had been agreed that the Assessments Staff would look again at the
Assessment and the intelligence report to “bring the text … into line with what
the Assessment and the intelligence said”.
In relation to the DIS suggestion that the wording in the Executive Summary
should be qualified by adding “intelligence suggests that”, the Assessments Staff
had taken the view that “it was not possible to qualify” its judgement in that way:
“It was not a summary of the main points in the text, it was a judgement.”

633.  Mr Scarlett stated that the main text in the dossier was redrafted to reflect
the “original intelligence which contained no caveat of uncertainty” and the
JIC Assessment.346

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

634.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September stated:
“Iraq has probably dispersed its special weapons, including its CBW weapons.
Intelligence also indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be with
military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.”347
635.  In response to a series of questions intended to elicit whether the “assessors”
should have had regard to the fact that they did not know to which munitions the report
referred, where they were, and that the information was second-hand, albeit relayed
through a reliable intermediary, Mr Scarlett replied:
“You are talking as if the assessors … operate in a vacuum. They do not. They are
assessing individual reports against the background of their knowledge. This was
a point of precision, to an assessment which already existed about the capability
of the Iraqi armed forces in this area.”348
636.  Mr Scarlett subsequently stated: “The sentence in the [JIC] Assessment was
referring to the intelligence report … It was not looking at it in the wider context.”
That was “taken into account in the main body of the text” but the judgement in
the Executive Summary “was a different point”; it did “not just confine itself to one
intelligence report”.
637.  The Iraq Inquiry wrote to Air Chief Marshal Sir Joe French, Mr Cragg, and
Dr Roper asking a number of specific questions about whether they had seen or been
briefed on the report of 11 September, and with whom they had discussed the issues
that arose.
638.  In his statement, ACM French confirmed that he had seen the 11 September
report but he “did not receive any further briefing on it”.349 He had not discussed the
distribution of the report with either Mr Cragg or Dr Roper and could not “remember
receiving any advice or briefing” on it from them. Nor could he “remember detail of
the discussion” at any JIC meeting.
639.  Asked whether he had asked for the report to be made available to the relevant
experts in the DIS for their assessment, ACM French wrote:
“Given the way the compilation of the dossier was being handled with the
involvement of the specialists/experts from across the intelligence community,
including the DIS, I would have expected them to [be] given the background to
this intelligence if not access to the report itself. This was a regular occurrence
where intelligence initially on limited distribution would be shared at the experts

level to allow common understanding of issues for the drafting of cross intelligence
community reports and studies commissioned by the JIC.”
640.  ACM French also wrote that he had not discussed the concerns raised by DIS
staff with Mr Scarlett, Mr Miller, or any member of the Assessments Staff. He could
not “remember the specific discussion” with Mr Cragg or Dr Roper but added:
“… in the regular staffing of JIC papers, the dossier included, it was not unusual
for subject matter experts to have differences of opinion over the emphasis given
to specific strands of intelligence and those concerns would be raised with me for
consideration before final clearance.”
641.  Asked on what basis he had given formal DIS endorsement to the judgements
in the dossier given the advice of some members of the DIS that the final draft was,
in some respects, stronger than the intelligence indicated, ACM French wrote:
“The fact that individuals expressed concern was part of the usual process of
debate and assessment which went on regularly within the DIS and within the wider
intelligence community as a prelude to a consensus being reached by the JIC.
My judgement was that the well tried due process had been followed and I was
content with the final draft of the dossier.”
642.  In his statement to the Iraq Inquiry, Mr Cragg wrote that he had not seen the report
and that he had had “no discussions at the time” with “anybody” about its contents and
implications because he “had not received it or had any knowledge of its contents or
source”.350 He had “asked Dr Roper to inform Dr Jones … of the strict compartmenting
of the report at the earliest opportunity”.
643.  Asked about his response to the concerns raised by DIS staff, Mr Cragg wrote
that he had had “a brief discussion with Dr Roper on 17 September about the [DIS]
comments on the draft of 16 September”. He had “interrupted a meeting” he was holding
with Dr Roper and the DIS Director of Global Issues on 17 September to allow them to
hear an account of the meeting held by Mr Miller. The DIS officials who had attended the
meeting reported that “the SIS participant had informed them that particularly sensitive
intelligence on the production of chemical and biological agent had very recently been
received which supported the formulation in the draft”; and that Mr Miller “had concurred”
with that. The SIS representative had also informed them that the distribution would be
extremely limited.
644.  Mr Cragg did not attend the JIC meeting on 11 September. He wrote that the
11 September SIS report was not discussed at the JIC meeting on 18 September.
645.  Mr Cragg saw a copy of Dr Jones’ minute to Dr Roper of 19 September in which
he stated that he and his staff “considered that in their judgement Iraq was probably

350 

Statement, 15 June 2011.

237

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

producing chemical and biological agents but they had not seen the intelligence to
‘show’ this”. Dr Jones also reported that they “were even more convinced that Iraq had
continued to produce biological agents but that they would not go so far as to say that
they ‘know’ this”.
646.  Mr Cragg wrote that he had not discussed the minute with Dr Jones or Dr Roper
“because I read it after the working day and saw it as reiterating that neither he
[Dr Jones] nor his staff had seen the compartmented intelligence to support the
formulation in the draft, while at the same time confirming that the judgement of the
dossier on this issue was probably right”. He did not raise the matter with Mr Scarlett,
Mr Miller or the Assessments Staff, “because it was well known to the drafters of the
dossier that the DIS’ scientific staff had not seen the recent compartmented intelligence
on the current production of chemical and biological agent”.
647.  Mr Cragg was absent from the office from 20 to 24 September. He wrote that
he was:
“… satisfied with the draft of 19 September, which was substantially the same
as that of 20 September. I took the view that the judgement in the dossier on the
current production of chemical and biological agent in the Executive Summary
and the formulation in the main text was justified by the available intelligence on
production, including in the JIC Assessment of 9 September and my awareness that
the compartmented intelligence was seen as reliable. It was also consistent with our
overall assessment of Iraqi WMD capabilities.”
648.  In his statement to the Iraq Inquiry, Dr Roper confirmed that he had discussed
Dr Jones’ minute of 19 September with him on 23 September and that he could not:
“… recall all that was discussed; I sensed he was annoyed that so much had been
happening whilst he had been away. I do remember asking him a specific question
along the lines of ‘Are you telling me you do not believe there is WMD in Iraq?’ His
reply was along the line: ‘No I am not saying that, on balance I believe there is WMD
in Iraq but not with the degree of conviction implied in the draft dossier’.”351
649.  Dr Roper wrote that Mr Cragg had raised Dr Jones’ letter with him “possibly later
that day [23 September]”. Dr Roper described Mr Cragg as “annoyed” that the letter had
been sent; and that Mr Cragg “seemed content” when Dr Roper relayed the gist of his
conversation with Dr Jones.

351 

Statement, 27 May 2011.

238

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

650.  Dr Roper wrote that he was “more concerned” by a letter sent by the chemical
warfare expert in Dr Jones’ team on 20 September, which they had discussed with
the CW expert the following week. The CW expert had:
“… explained his understanding of the CW position in Iraq noting that there had
been thousands of tonnes of chemical agent, much of it destroyed by UNSCOM,
but he noted that he couldn’t rule out the existence of a few hundred tonnes of
unaccounted stock some of which could retain potency. However his key point was
that he had seen no evidence that Iraq had resumed any production of chemical
agent since the Gulf War.”
651.  Dr Roper wrote that he “was alerted to the existence of new sensitive material
on CW production” by an SIS officer by telephone. The conversation was short but
Dr Roper recalled that he was told “it referred to evidence of resumption in CW
production”. Dr Roper also wrote that he had been “assured” that Air Marshal French
and Mr Cragg had seen the document. Dr Roper could not recall the precise date of
that conversation, but he thought it had “probably” taken place before 23 September.
652.  Dr Roper wrote that he had not discussed the existence of the new intelligence
with either AM French or Mr Cragg, or with anyone else. His conversation with the CW
expert on 23 September:
“… was very late in the dossier production process and only minor editorial
comments on the wording were being called for at this stage. I concluded the
conversation with [name of expert] suggesting that those responsible for forming the
final judgement no doubt had access to this new intelligence and would take it into
consideration. I took no further action.”
653.  The Inquiry shares the view of the Butler Review that the dossier contained
a stronger assessment in relation to Iraqi chemical weapons production than was
justified by the available intelligence.
654.  The SIS report of 11 September was a factor in that.
655.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s concerns about ensuring the protection of
such an important potential source of evidence were, in the circumstances,
understandable.
656.  But the Inquiry shares the conclusion of the Butler Review that it should
have been shown to the experts in the Defence Intelligence Staff who could have
commented on the credibility and validity of that report and the subsequent
report issued on 23 September and advised their senior managers and the
Assessments Staff.
657.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s personal intervention, and its urgency, gave added
weight to a report that had not been properly evaluated and would have coloured

239

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

the perception of Ministers and senior officials. The report should have been
treated with caution.
658.  The withdrawal after the conflict of three streams of reporting underpinning
the judgements in the dossier on Iraq’s chemical and biological warfare
capabilities and intentions, including the reports of 11 and 23 September and the
“45 minutes” report, is addressed in Section 4.3.
659.  The Inquiry has identified a number of lessons which arise from the way
in which the dossier was produced at the end of this Section.
660.  The details of the JIC Assessments on Iraq’s WMD between December 2000 and
September 2002 demonstrate that the JIC consistently stated in those Assessments
that the intelligence on most aspects of Iraq’s activity in relation to chemical, biological
and nuclear weapons programmes was limited, and that many of its judgements were
inferential.
661.  The intelligence on Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes was more extensive,
but there were still significant uncertainties about Iraq’s capabilities.
662.  In relation to the concerns expressed by the DIS, Lord Hutton concluded:
“… the concerns expressed by Dr Jones were considered by higher echelons in the
Intelligence Services and were not acted upon, and the JIC … approved the wording
in the dossier. Moreover, the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons section of
the Defence Intelligence Staff, headed by Dr Brian Jones, did not argue that the
intelligence relating to the 45 minutes claim should not have been included in the
dossier but they did suggest that the wording in which the claim was stated was
too strong and that instead of the dossier stating ‘we judge’ that ‘Iraq has: – military
plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including against its own Shia
population. Some of those weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order
to use them’, the wording should state ‘intelligence suggests’.”352
663.  The Butler Report stated that the 9 September JIC Assessment had been “written
to inform military and other contingency planning” but its “precautionary judgements”,
which were appropriate for that purpose:
“… were subsequently taken up into the dossier, and were taken up in an
abbreviated form in which points were run together and caveats on the intelligence
were dropped …
“…The same was true of the 21 August and 15 March Assessments …

240

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

“Experienced readers would have seen these warnings in the original JIC
Assessments and taken them into account … But the public … would not have
known … The dossier did include a first chapter on the role of intelligence, as
an introduction for the lay reader. But rather than illuminating the limitations of
intelligence … the language of this Chapter may have had the opposite effect …
Readers may, for example have read language in the dossier as implying that there
was fuller and firmer intelligence behind the judgements than was the case: our
view, having reviewed all the material, is that judgements in the dossier went to
(although not beyond) the outer limits of the intelligence available.”353
664.  The Butler Report also stated that the dossier:
“… did not refer explicitly to the JIC’s uncertainty about the size of stocks of sarin
and VX precursors, and hence Iraq’s ability to produce these agents. Nor did it, like
the JIC Assessments, refer explicitly to the lack of intelligence on the location of
facilities for producing biological and chemical agent, although it did draw attention
to the difficulty of assessing the use made of ‘dual-use’ facilities.”354
665.  The Butler Report concluded that: “Partly because of inherent difficulties”,
including the complications created by dual-use programmes, the JIC assessments of
Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes were “less assured” than the assessments
of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities, and that they:
“… tended to be over cautious and in some areas worst case. Where there was
a balance of inference to be drawn, it tended to go in the direction of inferring the
existence of banned weapons programmes. Assessments were as a consequence
less complete, especially in their considerations of alternative hypotheses, and used
a different burden of proof.”355
666.  The Butler Report stated:
“The intelligence community will have had in mind that Iraq had not only
owned but used its chemical weapons in the past. It will inevitably have been
influenced by the way in which the Iraqi regime was engaged in a sustained
programme to try to deceive United Nations inspectors and to conceal from
them evidence of its prohibited programmes. Furthermore, because SIS did not have
agents with first-hand knowledge of Iraq’s nuclear, chemical, biological or ballistic
missile programmes, most of the intelligence reports on which assessments
were being made were inferential. The Assessments Staff and JIC were

not fully aware of the access and background of key informants, and could
not therefore read their material against the background of an understanding
of their motivations for passing on information.”356
667.  The Butler Report also addressed the fact that the SIS report of 11 September
had been given a very restricted circulation and drew attention to the:
“… evidence of difficulties that arose from the unduly strict
‘compartmentalisation’ of intelligence which meant that experts in DIS did not
have access to an intelligence report which became available in September 2002
and played a major role for the JIC in confirming previous intelligence reports that
Iraq was producing chemical and biological weapons.”357
668.  Sir Richard Dearlove told the Butler Review that:
“… SIS were concerned to minimise knowledge of the existence of the source during
what they expected to be an initial, very sensitive, period of development. The
source’s intelligence about chemical weapons production was therefore distributed
to an extremely limited circle of senior readers.”358
669.  The Butler Report stated that:

•	
•	
•	

It understood “SIS’s concern to give maximum protection to their source in those
particular, and transitional, circumstances”.
It had been “told that in-house SIS technical experts took a preliminary and
provisional view that the report should be issued, as being from ‘A new source
on trial’”.
“But the exclusion of Dr Jones and his staff from readership of the original
report meant that this intelligence was not seen by the few people in the UK
intelligence community able to form all-round, professional technical judgements
on its reliability and significance.”359

670.  The Butler Report added:
“•	 We recognise that circumstances arise in which it is right for senior officials to
take a broad view that differs from the opinions of those with expertise on points
of detail.

•	

We do not, however, consider that the report held back from Dr Jones and
his staff (which Dr Jones’s superiors regarded as justifying the certainty of

the language in the dossier) was one to which such considerations should
have applied.
The judgement reached by the JIC in this case should have been able to depend
on detailed, expert analysis of the intelligence.
In the event, the JIC had no reason to know that that had not happened.
It was understandable that SIS should have wanted to give greater than normal
protection to the human intelligence source on this occasion.
But a problem arose because it was kept from the relevant DIS analysts who
had a wider perspective.360
It would have been more appropriate for senior managers in the DIS and SIS to
have made arrangements for the intelligence to be shown to DIS experts rather
than their making their own judgements on its significance.
The fact that it was not shown to them resulted in a stronger assessment in the
dossier in relation to Iraqi chemical weapons production than was justified by the
available intelligence.
It also deprived SIS of key expertise that would have helped them to assess the
reliability of their new source.
We have not been presented with any evidence that persuades us that there
was an insuperable obstacle to allowing expert-level DIS access to
the intelligence.”361

671.  The Butler Report stated:
“We accept the need for careful handling of human intelligence reports to
sustain the security of sources … We accept that this report was from a new
source who was thought to be of great potential value and was therefore of extreme
sensitivity. Nevertheless, it was wrong that a report which was of significance
in the drafting of a document of the importance of the dossier was not shown
to key experts in the DIS who could have commented on the validity and
credibility of the report.”362
672.  The Butler Report added:
“… arrangements should always be sought to ensure that the need for protection of
sources should not prevent the exposure of reports on technical matters to the most
expert available analysis.”363
The Inquiry infers that that is a reference to wider knowledge of chemical and biological weapons
programmes.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

673.  Asked by the Iraq Inquiry whether, in the light of the view expressed at the JIC
meeting on 4 September that the 9 September Assessment needed to make clearer
where there were remaining major gaps in the UK’s knowledge and understanding of
Iraq’s capabilities, he had felt that this should have been an integral part of the dossier,
Sir John Scarlett replied:
“… there was no sort of discussion or conscious decision made to leave out
references to limited intelligence. There was no deliberate intention to do that.
“The reason it happened may be because of the way the dossier was structured,
and the fact that it began with an Executive Summary, which was explicitly a
collection of judgements, as opposed to a sort of listing of intelligence.
“The place where it could have happened would have been in the introduction
[Chapter 1: The Role of Intelligence], where we were talking about the nature
of intelligence …”364
674.  Sir John added:
“But … the judgements and confidence in the judgements [in the 9 September
Assessment] was high, in spite of the areas where we didn’t have knowledge.
So it was the gaps in detailed knowledge, rather than [gaps] in confidence about
basic judgements.”
675.  Mr Miller added:
“The intelligence was not all encompassing … What we tried to do in the
Assessment and in the dossier was to describe the intelligence as directly as
we could, and then set out clearly and distinctly the judgements which had been
reached.
“… We felt it was right that the firmness of the judgements that had been expressed
in the classified Assessment [of 9 September] should be echoed in the published …
[dossier].”365
676.  Subsequently, in response to a question about the absence of caveats in the
Key Judgements of Assessments, which were what Ministers were “meant to read”,
Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:
“… this is… the issue that effectively arose around the drafting of the dossier … it
wasn’t because they had deliberately been left out. It was because of the use of the
Executive Summary as the equivalent of the [JIC’s] Key Judgements.”366

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

677.  Sir John added that, after the publication of the Butler Report in July 2004, “all
front pages of the Assessments [ie the page with the Key Judgements] have contained
a box on the intelligence base” which “spells out the strengths and weaknesses of
the intelligence”. That allowed the Key Judgements to be made while flagging up
the caveats.
678.  Asked if he had expressed any concerns during the drafting of the dossier, for
instance about caveats being dropped or because the text becoming more definite than
a normal JIC report might have been, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:
“… with the benefit of hindsight, I was happy with what the dossier said in terms
of what we believed at the time that it was written.”367
679.  In the context of a reference to comment in the Butler Report that the language
of the dossier may have left readers with the impression that there was fuller and firmer
intelligence behind the judgements in the dossier than was the case, Sir Richard added:
“Yes, I know it said that, but I think it is easy to write these things afterwards. I mean,
you know, at the time when that dossier was published, it’s what we believed on the
evidence available, partly historical – significantly historical – partly based on the
sources, […]
…
“… I had been worried about the dossier for a very long time because I didn’t feel
that we had a very substantive picture from intelligence. We had a substantive
picture from historical material.
“By the time, you know, the draft was complete, I was, I think, surprised how much
material had been assembled. I think you have to recall, when this document was
published -- and I would actually refer you also to the Institute of Strategic Studies
document. Both were felt to be rather conservative, rather reserved pictures of what
Iraq’s capability was at that time. You know, it’s only now – and I’m also firmly of the
view that we still don’t have a complete picture of Iraq’s WMD …”368
680.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s position on the very restricted circulation of the SIS reports
of 11 and 23 September is set out earlier in this Section.

Mr Blair’s Foreword
681.  In its report, Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction – Intelligence and Assessment,
published in September 2003, the ISC examined “whether the available intelligence,

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

which informed the decision to invade Iraq, was adequately and properly assessed and
whether it was accurately reflected in Government publications”, including three of the
statements made in the Foreword.369
THREAT TO THE UK NATIONAL INTEREST
682.  In relation to the statement in Mr Blair’s Foreword that he believed Iraq, and its
weapons of mass destruction, was “a current and serious threat to the UK national
interest”, the ISC stated:
“On the question of what direct threat Saddam, his regime and his WMD posed
to UK interests, the evidence is that UK forces deployed in the region to enforce
the … No-Fly Zones were threatened by conventional weapons, and could have
been threatened by any biological and chemical weapons that Saddam possessed.
Additionally, if Al Hussein missiles had been retained and they were operational
with conventional or chemical and biological warheads, they could have attacked
UK forces in Cyprus or those conducting operations in the region. Saddam’s WMD
programmes and his continued support of them increased this threat.”370
683.  The ISC stated that the first draft of Mr Blair’s Foreword had made clear that
the Government recognised that Saddam Hussein did not pose a direct threat to the
UK: “The case I make is not that Saddam could launch a nuclear attack on London
or another part of the UK (He could not).”371
684.  In the ISC’s view, it was “unfortunate” that the point was removed in the
published version, “and not highlighted elsewhere”.
685.  The ISC concluded:
“Saddam was not considered a current or imminent threat to mainland UK, nor did
the dossier say so.”372
686.  In its response to the ISC, the Government welcomed that conclusion, adding:
“The dossier was not intended to make the case for military action against Iraq;
it was intended to share with the public the intelligence being presented to the
Government which (along with much open source information) showed that Iraq
was in serious breach of several UNSCRs.”373

687.  The Government’s response to the ISC addressed a different point to the issue
of whether Iraq, and its weapons of mass destruction, was a “current and serious threat
to the UK national interest” at the time the dossier was issued.
688.  The statement that Mr Blair believed Iraq and its weapons of mass
destruction was “a current and serious threat to the UK national interest”
reflected his view.
689.  But it did not reflect the view of the JIC, which had addressed the threat
posed by Iraq and assessed that Iraq’s capabilities and intentions were limited
and related to the balance of power in the region and internal challenges.
690.  JIC Assessments between January 2001 and September 2002 did not formally
consider the threat posed by Iraq to UK interests.
691.  In its Assessment of 1 December 2000, the JIC stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	

“Although Iraqi forces are still large and well organised by regional standards,
a military offensive outside Iraq’s borders would be limited by shortfalls
in equipment and logistics.”
“UN sanctions have successfully prevented the procurement of new
weapon systems.”
“While US/UK forces remain deployed in the region and prepared to intervene
militarily, an attack on Kuwait is very unlikely.”
“Iraq has probably [disassembled and] concealed a handful of 650km range
ballistic missiles that could reach Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and even Israel …
But even if Saddam has such weapons he is unlikely to use them except in
extremis, in order to preserve his regime or as a final gesture of defiance.”374

692.  The JIC Assessment of 28 November 2001 stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
374 
375 

“… we judge Iraq had no responsibility for, or foreknowledge of, attacks in the
US on 11 September.”
“Saddam has refused to permit any Al Qaida presence in Iraq. He is
ideologically poles apart from the Sunni extremist networks linked to UBL
[Usama Bin Laden] and fears their impact on the population.”
“Iraq has long seen terrorism as a potential weapon in its conflict with the US
and regional enemies. […] Since September 11, however, Saddam is likely
to have ruled out such attacks for the time being, for fear of a heavy
US response.”
“But in the medium term the threat against Western interests and regional states
remains credible. Saddam has not given up terrorism as a policy tool.”375

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

693.  The JIC Assessment of 19 April 2002 stated:
“… Iraq is rarely perceived as the greatest security threat within the region. Except
for Kuwait, the Gulf States see Iran as the greater long-term security threat and want
an Iran-Iraq balance …”376
694.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 judged that the use of chemical and
biological weapons before a military attack on Iraq was “unlikely”.377
695.  The Executive Summary of the dossier stated that intelligence showed:
“… Saddam Hussein attaches great importance to possessing weapons of mass
destruction which he regards as the basis for Iraq’s regional power. It shows that
he does not regard them only as weapons of last resort. He is ready to use them,
including against his own population, and is determined to retain them …”378
696.  The Executive Summary also stated:
“But the threat from Iraq does not depend solely on the capabilities we have
described. It arises also because of the violent and aggressive nature of Saddam
Hussein’s regime. His record of internal repression and external aggression gives
rise to unique concerns about the threat he poses. The paper briefly outlines
… Saddam’s rise to power, the nature of his regime and his history of regional
aggression. Saddam’s human rights abuses are also catalogued …”379
697.  Mr Powell explicitly cautioned that, while Iraq had the means, the dossier did
not demonstrate that it posed an imminent threat. In his email to Mr Scarlett on
17 September, Mr Powell wrote that the dossier:
“… does nothing to demonstrate a threat, let alone an imminent threat from Saddam
In other words it shows he has the means but it does not demonstrate he has
the motive to attack his neighbours let alone the west We will need to make clear
in launching the document that we do not claim to have evidence that he is an
imminent threat The case we are making is that he has continued to develop WMD
since 1998, and is in breach of UN resolutions The international community has to
enforce those resolutions if the UN is to be taken seriously”.380
698.  Addressing Mr Powell’s comments about the “imminent threat”, Mr Campbell
replied that was “why TB’s Foreword sets out ‘the case I am making’”.381

699.  In a further email on 18 September, Mr Powell concluded:
“The threat argument will be a major problem in the press/parliamentary assault after
the dossier comes out and we need to flag up the point in the preface at publication
and during the debate. We need to set the test for ourselves at a level we can meet”.382
700.  There is no indication that Mr Blair saw the emails from Mr Powell.
CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL “WEAPONS”
701.  Commenting on the statement that Iraq “continued to produce chemical and
biological weapons”, the ISC stated:
“The use of the phrase … and the absence of detail on amounts of agents
produced in the executive summary and main text could give the impression
that Saddam was actively producing both chemical and biological weapons
and significant amount of agents.”383
702.  The ISC added:
“However the JIC did not know what had been produced and in what
quantities – it had assessed, based on intelligence, that production had taken
place. We believe this uncertainty should have been highlighted to give a
balanced view of Saddam’s chemical and biological capacity.”
703.  Asked if the information available in early 2002 showed that Saddam Hussein’s
WMD programmes had changed very little since 1998, and that there were strong
caveats about the reliability of the intelligence, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:
“Yes, the principal intelligence … in March 2002, was that our knowledge was
‘sporadic’ and ‘patchy’…”384
704.  Mr Blair added that he thought the Assessment went on to say, “but it is clear that
Saddam continues his programme”.
705.  Asked if it was “wise to say that intelligence is ever beyond doubt”, and if that was
“setting a higher standard of proof than it might be possible to sustain”, Mr Blair replied:
“I think what I said …
‘What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that
Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons.’
“I did believe it … and I did believe it, frankly, beyond doubt.”385

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

706.  Asked whether it was “beyond anybody’s doubt”, Mr Blair stated that the
“March 2002 JIC Assessment”, said: “It was clear that …”386
707.  Mr Blair added:
“… if I said, ‘It was clear that’ in the Foreword, rather than ‘I believe, beyond doubt’,
it would have had the same impact.”
708.  Mr Blair added that, based on the Executive Summary and the information that
followed in the Iraq dossier, it was “hard to come to any other conclusion than that this
person [Saddam Hussein] has a continuing WMD programme”. Mr Blair could not “see
how anyone could come to a different conclusion”.387
709.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September stated that intelligence indicated
that the production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place and
the Executive Summary of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had
continued to produce chemical and biological agents. Neither supported the
statement that the “assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt” that
Saddam Hussein had “continued to produce chemical and biological weapons”.
710.  The questions raised by the DIS about the validity of these judgements
by the JIC are addressed earlier in this Section.
711.  The JIC Assessment of 1 December 2000 stated:

•	

•	
•	
•	
•	

Intelligence suggested “some biological and chemical warfare activity”. Iraq
was “rebuilding its civil chemical industry, including facilities formerly associated
with chemical weapons”. The JIC judged that “Iraq may already be producing
biological agent and could produce a small number of chemical weapons
within weeks of a decision to do so”.
Iraq could “build a large scale production capability within a few years”
“were economic sanction lifted”.
The same was “probably true for biological weapons”.
Iraq “could produce small but significant amounts of mustard agent within weeks
of a decision to do so. It could produce nerve agent within months … It could
also produce small numbers of CW munitions and missile warheads.”
Iraq still had “sufficient expertise and material to produce BW without
procurement from abroad. It could use legitimate civil or dedicated BW facilities,
including mobile laboratories, for this work.”388

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

712.  The JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Intelligence reports reflected “a continuing chemical warfare programme,
including research and development, together with the possible production and
weaponisation of agent”.
The JIC had “good intelligence of Iraq’s former chemical and biological warfare
(CBW) facilities, their limited reconstruction and civil production”.
The JIC had “good intelligence of Iraq’s former CW associated facilities”.
Intelligence of “other related CW activity, including possible weaponisation” was
“less clear”.
“Whilst the picture as regards biological weapons was unclear,” there were
indications of “continuing biological warfare research and the possible
production of agent”.389

713.  The introduction to the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated:
“Intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile
programmes is sporadic and patchy. Iraq is also well practised in the art of
concealment and exaggeration. A complete picture of various programmes is
therefore difficult. But it is clear that Iraq continues to pursue a policy of acquiring
WMD and their delivery means. Intelligence indicates that planning to reconstitute
some of its programmes began in 1995. WMD programmes were then given a
further boost in 1998 with the withdrawal of UNSCOM inspectors.”390
714.  On detailed points, the Assessment stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

389 
390 

“We continue to judge that Iraq has an offensive chemical warfare (CW)
programme, although there is very little intelligence relating to it.”
“From the evidence available … we believe Iraq retains some production
equipment, and some small stocks of CW agent precursors, and may
have hidden small quantities of agents and weapons. Anomalies in Iraqi
declarations to UNSCOM suggest stocks could be much larger.”
Intelligence on production facilities was “scarce” and “the reconstructed former
precursor facility near Habbaniyah” was “insufficient to support large-scale CW
agent production”.
“Other industrial chemical facilities could be used … but we have no intelligence
to suggest they are currently being used in that role.”
“Intelligence has indicated an Iraqi interest in transportable production facilities
for chemical weapons, but these could produce only small amounts of agent and
we judge it more likely that the mobile units are filling munitions”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	
•	

There had been “one uncorroborated report” that Iraq had “filled some artillery
rocket munitions with VX in the period 1996-1998, and another that a team of
chemists was formed in 1998 to produce 5 tons of VX. The source was told this
had been completed by the end of 1998”.
Work on biological warfare programmes had “continued throughout the period
of UNSCOM inspections” and intelligence indicated “that this programme
continues. Key figures from the pre-Gulf War programme are reported to be
involved.”
Research and development was “assessed to continue under cover of a number
of legitimate institutes and possibly in a number of covert facilities”.
There was “no intelligence on any BW agent production facilities, but one
source indicates that Iraq may have developed mobile production facilities”.
The Assessment stated: “Though not corroborated, we judge the reporting is
technically credible. Imagery has yet to provide firm collateral but has identified
a number of sites that could be associated with this programme. The mobile
production facilities have yet to be identified.”
The CIG did not know “which types of agent are produced by these facilities”.
“A decision to begin CBW production would probably go undetected.”
Iraq was “judged to be self-sufficient in the production of biological weapons”.

715.  In the Key Judgements, the CIG stated that, while research and development
programmes continued, Iraq’s actual capabilities were finite. There was no intelligence
on the production of chemical and biological agents or weapons.
716.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 judged that:

•	
•	

“Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared
to use it.”
“Iraq currently has available, either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent
production, a number of biological warfare (BW) and chemical warfare (CW)
agents and weapons …”391

717.  The Assessment stated:
“One intelligence report suggests that Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop
warheads capable of disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it
would take six months to overcome the ‘technical difficulties’”.

Possible Scenarios’.

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

718.  The Assessment also stated:
“Other recent intelligence indicates that:

•	
•	

production of chemical and biological weapons is taking place;
…”

719.  The Executive Summary of the dossier stated:
“As a result of the intelligence we judge that Iraq has:

•	
•	
•	

continued to produce chemical and biological weapons;

•	

developed mobile laboratories for military use corroborating earlier reports
about the mobile production of biological warfare agents;

•	

military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons …;
command and control arrangements in place to use chemical and biological
weapons …;

pursued illegal programmes to procure controlled materials of potential use
in the production of chemical and biological weapons programmes …”392

720.  The main text of the dossier stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“Iraq has a usable chemical and biological weapons capability … which has
included recent production of chemical and biological agents.”393
“Intelligence shows that Iraq has continued to produce chemical agent.”394
“We know from intelligence that Iraq has continued to produce biological warfare
agents.”395
“UNSCOM established that Iraq considered the use of mobile biological agent
production facilities. In the past two years evidence from defectors has indicated
the existence of such facilities. Recent intelligence confirms that the Iraqi military
have developed mobile facilities.”396
“Iraq has a variety of delivery means.”397

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

721.  Asked whether Mr Blair’s knowledge of the SIS reporting, of 11 September, could
have influenced Mr Blair, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:
“… if you look at what he … actually says ‘beyond doubt on the assessed
intelligence’, this isn’t part of the assessed intelligence.”398
IRAQ’S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS
722.  The ISC also considered the statement that Mr Blair believed “the assessed
intelligence has established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein “continues in his
efforts to develop nuclear weapons”.399
723.  The ISC pointed out that the Executive Summary and main body of the dossier
were less certain:

•	
•	

The Executive Summary stated: “As a result of the intelligence, we judge Iraq
has … sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.”
The dossier itself stated that there was “intelligence that Iraq has sought the
supply of significant quantities of uranium from Africa”.

724.  Although there were some references to Iraq having a “nuclear programme”,
the JIC Assessments and the dossier made clear that Iraq’s efforts to develop a
nuclear weapon were effectively constrained by the dismantling of its physical
infrastructure by the IAEA and continuing sanctions.
725.  There was intelligence which indicated: attempts to procure dual-use
equipment which could be used in a nuclear programme; possible attempts to
obtain uranium; and that Iraq had retained the knowledge and personnel from
its previous programme.
726.  But neither the JIC Assessments at the time nor the judgements in the
Executive Summary of the dossier supported the statement that the “assessed
intelligence has established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein “continues
in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons”.
727.  The JIC Assessment of 1 December 2000 stated:

•	

Iraq had “retained the scientific cadre associated with nuclear weapons work
[…] Unconfirmed intelligence indicates Iraqi interest in acquiring uranium and
continuing nuclear weapons related research after the Gulf War. None of
the intelligence acquired since the war is ‘smoking gun’ evidence. But it remains
suspicious and seems indicative of attempts to retain a cadre of expertise, which
will decline over time without international access.”

•	

“Iraq still lacks fissile material and the infrastructure to make it.”
If it were “able to acquire sufficient fissile [material] for a weapon or centrifuges
and feed material from outside Iraq”, the time periods to manufacture a crude
nuclear weapon and a nuclear warhead could, “with foreign assistance”, be
“significantly shortened”.400

728.  The JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	

The JIC had “no clear intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear programme”. There was
“evidence of increased activity at Iraq’s only remaining nuclear facility and a
growing number of reports on possible nuclear related procurement”.
The JIC judged but could not confirm that Iraq was “conducting nuclear related
research and development into the enrichment of uranium and could have
longer term plans to produce enriched uranium for a weapon”.
Iraq had “recalled its nuclear scientists in 1998”. It had made “efforts … since
1998 to procure items that could be used in a uranium enrichment programme
using centrifuges”.
Those included: “aluminium [tubes]” and “other dual-use items”.401

729.  The introductory paragraph in the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated that
sanctions were constraining programmes to develop medium and long-range ballistic
missiles and nuclear weapons.402 The Assessment also stated:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“Iraq is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. But it will not be able to
indigenously produce a nuclear weapon while sanctions remain in place, unless
suitable fissile material is purchased from abroad.”
Iraq does not possess a nuclear weapons capability.
Its programme was effectively dismantled by the IAEA.
Although there was “very little intelligence”, the CIG continued to judge that
Iraq was “pursuing a nuclear weapons programme” which was assessed to be
“based on gas centrifuge uranium enrichment … the route Iraq was following
for producing fissile material prior to the Gulf War”.
“Recent intelligence” indicated that “nuclear scientists were recalled to work on
a nuclear programme in the autumn of 1998, but we do not know if large-scale
development work has yet recommenced”.
“Procurement of dual-use items over the last few years could be used in
a uranium enrichment programme. There have been determined efforts to
purchase high strength aluminium alloy …” A shipment stopped in Jordan was

inspected by the IAEA, “who accepted, that with some modifications … would be
suitable for use in centrifuges”; “But there was no definitive intelligence that the
aluminium was destined for a nuclear programme.”
The CIG continued to judge that:
{{ “[I]f

sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would take at least
five years to produce a nuclear weapon. This timescale would shorten if
fissile material was acquired from abroad.”

{{ Iraq

“was capable of producing an improvised nuclear device, but
it lacks suitable fissile material. Iraq has in the past explored the use
of radiological dispersal devices, but the design we have seen was
not a credible weapon. There is no intelligence that Iraq is interested
in such devices.”

730.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 did not address Iraq’s nuclear
aspirations, simply stating: “We do not believe Iraq possesses nuclear weapons.”403
731.  The Executive Summary of the dossier stated:
“As a result of the intelligence we judge that Iraq has

•	
•	
•	

tried covertly to acquire technology and materials which could be used
in the production of nuclear weapons;
sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa …
recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme …”

732.  The main text of the dossier:

•	
•	

referred to the JIC Assessment in May 2001 that Iraq had continued its
nuclear research and that there was intelligence that nuclear scientists had
been recalled; but it did not include the warning in that Assessment about the
limitations of the intelligence; and
stated that the IAEA had “dismantled the physical infrastructure of the Iraqi
nuclear weapons programme … But Iraq retained, and retains, many of its
experienced nuclear scientists and technicians who are specialised in the
production of fissile material and weapons design. Intelligence indicates that
Iraq also retains the accompanying programme documentation and data.”404

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

733.  The dossier made clear that Iraq would not be able to develop a nuclear weapon
without procuring key equipment and material, but stated:

•	
•	

“Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons in breach of its
obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty and in breach of UNSCR 687.
Uranium has been sought from Africa that has no civil nuclear application
in Iraq.”405
“… [T]here is intelligence that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities
of uranium from Africa.”406

734.  The FAC stated that the assertion in the September 2002 dossier should have
been qualified to “reflect the uncertainty” surrounding the evidence upon which it
was based.407
735.  The ISC took evidence from Sir Richard Dearlove on SIS judgements on the
reliability of its “two independent sources” for reporting in June and September 2002.408
While the IAEA had called into question documentary evidence it had received in
February 2003 and SIS was still conducting further investigations, the ISC reported
that it had been told that this “did not affect” SIS’ judgement of its second source and
its belief that Iraq was “attempting to negotiate the purchase of uranium from Niger”.
The ISC described the SIS judgement as reasonable.
736.  In its response to the FAC in November 2003, the FCO stated that: “the claim
in the September dossier rested on separate evidence to that judged fraudulent by
the IAEA”, and that this intelligence was still under review and had not been shared
with the CIA.409
737.  The Butler Review concluded that the “intelligence was credible” that Iraq had
sought to purchase uranium ore from Niger in 1999.410
738.  Iraqi officials had visited Niger in 1999 and further intelligence was received during
2002 which identified that the purpose of the visit had “been to negotiate the purchase
of uranium ore, although there was disagreement as to whether a sale had been agreed
and the uranium shipped”.411

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

739.  The Butler Report also stated that there was separate intelligence that the
Iraqi regime had made enquiries about the purchase of uranium ore from the
Democratic Republic of Congo and that there was some evidence that by 2002
a sale had been agreed.412
LONGER-RANGE MISSILE SYSTEMS
740.  In the Foreword to the dossier, Mr Blair also stated that he believed the
assessed intelligence had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein
had “been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme”.413
741.  One of the Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated that
there had been “a step change in progress” in Iraq’s ballistic missile programme over
the preceding two years.414
742.  The Assessment itself made clear that the change related to work on
development and infrastructure, including work on a “test stand with the capacity for
much larger engines than the Al Samoud”, rather than production of missiles with
ranges beyond the 150km permitted by the UN. It also stated that if Iraq developed short
range missiles with a range “well beyond” 150km, that would “represent a step change
in Saddam Hussein’s military capabilities”.
743.  A Key Judgement in the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated that Iraq
had retained “up to 20 Al Hussein ballistic missiles” with a range of 650km.415
The “location and condition” of those missiles was “unknown”, although Iraq had
“sufficient engineering expertise to make them operational”.
744.  A further Key Judgement in the 15 March CIG Assessment stated that Iraq had
“begun development of medium range ballistic missiles [with a range of] over
1000km that could target countries throughout the Middle East and Gulf region”, but
Iraq would “not be able to produce such a missile before 2007 provided sanctions
remain effective”. The Assessment itself stated that “UN sanctions and the work of
the inspectors” had “caused significant problems for Iraq’s missile industry”.
745.  The 15 March CIG Assessment also stated that there were reports that Iraq had
“succeeded in developing a number of 200km range variants” of the liquid propelled
Al Samoud missile, but it was “unclear” whether those were for operational use or for
the research and development of a longer-range missile.

746.  The CIG judged that the Ababil-100, a 150km range solid propellant missile, was
likely to become operational within two years, and intelligence indicated that Iraq had
plans to extend its range.
747.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 stated that Iraq was developing
Al Samoud and Ababil-100 missiles with a range of “150km plus”, which were being
deployed to military units and could have “an emergency operational capability with
conventional warheads”, not a capability to deliver chemical or biological warheads.416
748.  Mr Blair’s statement that he believed that the “assessed intelligence has
established beyond doubt” that “Saddam has continued to produce chemical
and biological weapons” and that “he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear
weapons”, went further than the assessments of the JIC.
749.  The JIC should have advised Mr Blair that he could not make that
statement.
750.  Asked about Mr Blair’s statement that he believed “the assessed intelligence has
established beyond doubt” that Iraq has continued to produce chemical and biological
weapons, continues in its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and had been able to
extend the range of its ballistic missile programme, Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry
that he:
“… saw the … Foreword as something quite separate from the text of the dossier
itself. The text of the dossier itself I was clearly responsible for drafting.
“The Foreword was overtly a political statement signed by the Prime Minister. So it
was his wording and his comments that were there throughout, although I did make
one or two, three maybe, small changes on the text of the Foreword, basically to
correct one or two small points, which I thought were – or actually add at one point
in particular about who received intelligence assessments in the first paragraph, and
also to bring it into line with the text of the dossier itself.
“There was a particular point on concealment. I didn’t see it as something that I
would change. That’s all I can recall now … it is quite difficult now to reconstruct the
actual sort of process of how this happened several years later … [B]ut my memory
at the time quite clearly was this was something which was the Prime Minister’s and
it was going out under his signature. So it was different from the attention that I paid
to the wording of the dossier.”417

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

751.  Asked whether, given that Mr Blair’s Foreword provided an interpretation of the
evidence in the dossier and other interpretations could have been made of the same
evidence, the interpretation and assessment should have been issued in separate
documents, Sir John Scarlett replied:
“Maybe, yes. But I can’t honestly say that that point was in my mind and I was
focused on that issue or that risk at the time. If I had been, then I would have
expressed a thought.”418
752.  Sir David Omand, who had taken up his post as the Security and Intelligence
Co‑ordinator on 3 September 2002, told the Inquiry that his memory was that he “didn’t
pay that much attention to this [the Foreword] … which was a mistake”.419
753.  Asked whether the phrase “beyond doubt” had rung any “alarm bells”, Sir David
replied that he had:
“… totally failed to spot the potential problem that would arise through the disjunction
between the statement of case being directly associated with the text of the dossier.
We [the JIC] were commenting on this as a document the Prime Minister was going
to produce under his own name, and he was convinced. So his saying so was not
really very exceptional.”

Publication of the dossier, 24 September 2002
Cabinet, 23 September 2002
754.  The ISC report in September 2003 stated that Mr Straw, Mr Blunkett, the
Home Secretary, and Mr Hoon had had the opportunity to comment on an early draft
of the dossier, but only Mr Straw did so.420 Private Offices decided that the draft
“did not require … the personal attention” of Mr Brown or Ms Short. The draft was
also sent to Ms Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary. It was not sent
to Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister.
755.  The briefing for Ministers produced by the Communications and Information Centre
(CIC) on 24 September 2002 drew attention to the statements in Mr Blair’s Foreword
about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the belief that the assessed intelligence
had “established beyond doubt” that he has “continued to produce chemical and
biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that
he has been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programmes”.421 It also set
out the list of judgements from the Executive Summary of the dossier.

756.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 23 September that the dossier “would show that the
policy of containment had worked up to a point” but Saddam Hussein “continued
to rebuild” his weapons of mass destruction.
757.  Cabinet met at 5pm on 23 September. The discussion is addressed in Section 3.5.
758.  Cabinet members were given a copy of the dossier to be published the
following day.
759.  In relation to the dossier, Mr Blair told his colleagues:
“… the dossier on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction would show that the policy
of containment had worked up to a point, but that Saddam Hussein … continued
to rebuild his programme to acquire such weapons. The evidence showed his efforts
to procure equipment and materials, and to restore production facilities. This was
an issue for the United Nations, with whose Security Council resolutions Iraq had
not complied. A new resolution was being negotiated.”422
760.  No specific discussion of the contents of the dossier was recorded although in the
discussion the point was made that the “development of weapons of mass destruction
by Saddam Hussein presented a quite different order of threat”.
761.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that a “crunch point” had been reached:
“The sanctions regime … was being eroded and Saddam Hussein was on the way
to acquiring new capability in weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had to comply with
the obligations placed on it by the United Nations …”
762.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had explained that the dossier “brought together
accumulated evidence about Iraq’s attempts to build WMD, part historical, part
intelligence-based”; “not saying that he [Saddam Hussein] was about to launch an attack
on London, but we were saying there was an attempt to build a WMD programme in a
significant way”.423
763.  Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from September 2002 to September 2005, told
the Inquiry:
“I think the dossier was ostensibly an attempt to inform the public. But one of the
effects it had was that the Cabinet all read it and basically decided – they absorbed
it and accepted it.”424

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

764.  Asked whether there had been a debate about different scenarios and different
possible courses, Lord Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005,
replied:
“… there was certainly a discussion around different scenarios that came up in the
way in which we addressed these issues in Cabinet …
“… in the September meeting, where, as you know, we were about to publish the
dossier, there was about to be a report to Parliament and there was a discussion
around that and it was a full discussion and, in the course of that, colleagues made
various contributions and various scenarios surfaced …
“What we did have was a full discussion around the issues as they were reported
to us …”425
765.  Addressing the September 2002 dossier on Iraq in his memoir, written after
his resignation from the Government, Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House
Commons, wrote:
“At Cabinet [on 24 September 2002] I described the dossier as ‘derivative’. What I
was expressing was the extraordinary degree to which the bulk of the document was
derived from what we know about Saddam’s arsenal … as it had been in 1991 …
What was doubtful was whether the arsenal that Saddam possessed in 1991 was
any guide whatsoever to the state of his capacity in 2002.
“For a start most chemical and biological agents that Saddam had retained for
a decade would long ago have degenerated to the point that they were of no
operational use. This is a principle of science well known to those who wrote the
dossier … Government Ministers alarmed the public by claims that Saddam had ten
thousand litres of anthrax solution unaccounted for since 1991. They never added
that the standard life of liquid anthrax is three years …
“… Last year the US Department of Defense … revealed, ‘When the Iraqis produced
chemical munitions they appeared to adhere to a ‘make and use’ regimen … Their
conclusion was that the shelf life of Iraqi chemical agents was numbered in weeks,
not decades.
“Half of the text relating to Iraq’s weapons capacity is drawn from the period before
1998. Much of the remainder depends for its claims of present capacity on historic
capabilities … Stripped of the historical resume … the dossier is very thin on new
evidence on the current position.”426

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

766.  Mr Cook subsequently wrote:
“The dossier … painted a one-sided picture … [I]t defiantly proclaimed a certitude for
its claims that was at odds with the nuanced tone of every JIC Assessment I read.”
767.  Mr Cook added:
“Personally I never doubted that No.10 believed in the threads of intelligence
which were woven into the dossier. But that does not alter the awkward fact that
the intelligence was wrong and Ministers who had applied a sceptical mind could
have seen that it was too thin to be a reliable base for war. No.10 believed in the
intelligence because they desperately wanted it to be true. Their sin was not one
of bad faith but of evangelical certainty. They selected for inclusion only the scraps
of intelligence that fitted the Government’s case. And gave them a harder edge
than was justifiable. The net result was a gross distortion. Although every individual
claim could be sourced … the overall effect was to present a false picture of an Iraq
bristling with real weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist.”
768.  In a section reflecting on the issues written after the conflict, Mr Cook wrote:
“Only in the last five days was the word Programme dropped from the title.
The clear implication is that No.10 wanted Parliament and public to believe that Iraq
had actual weapons …”
769.  In Mr Cook’s view:
“… the most egregious claim of all was that Saddam had attempted to reconstitute
his nuclear programme … The conclusion of the section on nuclear weapons is a
masterpiece of false suggestion.”
770.  Mr Cook described the section in the dossier addressing what Iraq might be able
to do if it obtained fissile material and other essential components as “a fanciful leap
into the realm of fantasy”: “This language is frightening. But as evidence that Iraq was a
threat it is pathetic and the authors must have known it.”

Mr Blair’s statement to Parliament, 24 September 2002
771.  Mr Blair wrote his statement himself and chose the arguments to make
clear his perception of the threat and why he believed that there was an
“overwhelming” case for action to disarm Iraq.
772.  Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Mr Scarlett and others were asked to identify “any facts
that are false and … any other essential changes that you would like to suggest”.
773.  Parliament was recalled from recess on 24 September to debate the case for
effective action in respect of the threat posed by Iraq.

263

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

774.  The Government dossier, Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Assessment of
the British Government, was published on 24 September.427
775.  Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons, the questions that followed, and the
subsequent debates on Iraq in both Houses of Parliament, are addressed in Section 3.5.
776.  In relation to Iraq’s WMD capabilities and intent, Mr Blair’s statement drew on the
dossier, including Mr Blair’s Foreword, the material sent to No.10 by the FCO on 2 and
4 September, and subsequent briefing material produced for the debate.
777.  Mr Rycroft sent a framework for the statement to Mr Blair, together with
background material, on 20 September.428
778.  The framework comprised six sections:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Introduction
The threat
The response
Tackling head-on some of the difficult questions to pre-empt questions
Consultation with Parliament; and
Conclusion.

779.  In relation to the threat, Mr Rycroft suggested:
“Summarise the dossier: main focus WMD, but also material on the nature
of Saddam’s regime. History of the inspectors and UNSCRs …”
780.  In the section on the response to the threat, Mr Rycroft set out the framework
of the UN route and that Iraq should comply with all the UN’s demands; and that
Saddam Hussein had:
“… a long history of claiming to offer unconditional access, but then attaching
conditions …
“For instance, the Iraqi Foreign Minister told the UN last week that Iraq is ‘clear of all
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons’. That is a lie. The dossier explains why.”
781.  Addressing the question “Why now?”, Mr Rycroft wrote:
“Dossier sets out the threat. It is increasing every year, especially with Saddam’s
illicit money. Would be unconscionable to be aware of the threat and do nothing.”

264

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

782.  Addressing the question “Why Saddam?”, Mr Rycroft wrote:
“Need to tackle WMD around the world. Have different strategies for N Korea, Libya
etc. With these countries there are at least … some ways of dealing diplomatically
with them. Not possible with Saddam’s Iraq. Only Saddam has (a) record of WMD
use, (b) violated so many UN obligations.”
783.  Mr Rycroft also wrote:

•	
•	

“The country [Iraq], region and world would be better off without Saddam, but the
issue is his WMD. He must disarm …”
There was: “No known link between Saddam and Al Qaida. Terrorism is not the
issue – WMD is.”

784.  The background documents included a FCO letter providing material to answer
points made in the debate.429 In relation to Iraq’s possession of WMD and the risk of
proliferation, the brief on military action stated:

•	
•	
•	

“… as dossier clearly sets out, Iraqi regime has accelerated its weapons
programmes since departure of inspectors. Saddam should be in no doubt about
our determination to remove the threat of his WMD.”
“What singles out Iraq as a proliferator is Saddam’s demonstrated willingness to
use WMD and wage war against his neighbours. Naive to suppose that we could
persuade Saddam through dialogue to give up his weapons …”
“In cases of other proliferators [Iran, North Korea and Libya], we have tried
to address our concerns through dialogue … even though some people have
criticised us for this.”

785.  The detailed briefing on WMD stated that:

•	
•	
•	
•	

429 

Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was “still hiding” them “in
a range of locations”. The regime had admitted “hiding chemical, biological
weapons and missile parts”.
The UK believed Iraq had “the capability to deliver these weapons to a range
of locations”.
Iraq had “admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare agents” and
“producing biological warfare agents”.
UN weapons inspectors had been “unable to account for thousands of tonnes
of so-called precursor chemicals used in the production of weapons; hundreds
of tonnes of precursor chemicals used in the production of VX nerve agent;
and tens of thousands of special munitions which can be used in chemical and
biological weapons”.

Letter Sedwill to Rycroft, 20 September 2002, ‘Iraq: Commons Debate: Supplementaries’.

265

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

786.  Addressing developments since 1998, the briefing stated that, “Despite tight
controls on imports”, Iraq continued “to pursue ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical and
biological programmes”.
787.  The detailed text was more nuanced, stating:

•	
•	

“We believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its weapons programme.”

•	

Saddam Hussein was believed to be “planning to extend the range of his current
missiles beyond the 150km limit imposed by the UN”.

•	
•	
•	

There had been “continued progress” on the ballistic missile programme, and
facilities damaged in December 1998 had been repaired.

There was concern about “reports of increased nuclear procurement”.
“We think that R&D on a nuclear weapons programme has restarted.”
“We believe that the Iraqi regime continues its biological and chemical weapons
programmes.”

788.  The briefing acknowledged that UN measures had:
“… played a vital role in frustrating Saddam’s ambitions to develop WMD. UNSCOM
and IAEA inspectors … And UN controls on Iraq imports have made it more difficult
for Iraq to acquire easily the WMD technology it is seeking.”
789.  Sanctions had “helped make Iraqi acquisition of WMD and the means to deliver
them more difficult” and had “undoubtedly slowed the pace of their reconstitution”. But
there were “always those who are willing to breach sanctions” and “Some equipment”
had “reached Iraq’s WMD programmes”.
790.  Mr Blair was also sent a copy of the Question and Answer briefing to accompany
the dossier.430 Key points of interest included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

“The dossier shows that Saddam has aggressively pursued his WMD
programme. In the four years since the departure of the inspectors things have
got worse, not better. It would be irresponsible to ignore those facts.”
Iraq possessed WMD: it was “still hiding weapons of mass destruction in a range
of locations” and it had “admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare
agents”.
There was “reliable intelligence” on mobile production facilities for biological

If it could “buy highly enriched uranium and essential components”, Iraq might
“be able to make a crude nuclear weapon in between one and two years”.
To deliver a nuclear warhead by ballistic missile, “Iraq would need a more
sophisticated design for a missile warhead than any it had before 1991. It could
well have done significant research on this while the inspectors have been away,
and may have even produced some parts in anticipation. With the acquired
fissile material and specialised parts, a warhead could be made for a missile in
about two years, but may well fail. Further time would allow the weapon to be
developed and tested to improve its reliability.”
“Iraq has admitted in the past making chemical and biological warheads for its
Al Hussein missiles. We believe they could do so again.”
Iraq had “the capability to have developed” chemical and biological warheads
for other types of missiles.
The dossier focused “on the threat posed by Iraq’s WMD programmes”.
There was “no evidence that Iraq has supplied WMD materials or advice to any
terrorist organisation”.
Al Qaida was “probably still trying” to develop a WMD capability: “It would benefit
greatly from support from a state programme. Allowing WMD to remain in the
hands of a regime such as Saddam’s must involve the risk that these weapons
will find there [sic] way into the hands of terrorists.”

791.  Addressing whether there were differences between the US and UK assessments,
the briefing stated:
“It is clear that the British and American Governments are in full agreement that
Saddam’s WMD programmes remains significant and growing. We are also in
full agreement that the international community must take action. Should not
be surprised if different analysts using information obtained in different ways at
different times come to slightly different technical conclusions – but the fundamental
judgements are identical.”
792.  Addressing whether the UK’s Iraq policy had created a climate for terrorism, the
brief stated:
“… Our Iraq policy is and will remain based on the imperative of containing the very
real threat posed by the Iraqi regime to Iraq’s people and its neighbours.”
793.  A 19-page briefing produced by the CIC on 20 September set out:

•	
•	

examples of Iraq’s past obstruction of inspections and its failure properly
to disclose information about its programmes;
statements made by Mr Scott Ritter during his time as a senior member
of UNSCOM;

267

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

examples of Iraq’s persecution of its own people and actions against other
Muslims in the region, including in Kuwait in 1990-1991; and
provisions of relevant UN resolutions.431

794.  In the “Key messages” of a briefing produced for the Labour Party on 20 September,
Iraq’s statement (in a letter from Saddam Hussein read to the UN General Assembly
on 19 September – see Section 3.5) that it “did not have nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons”432 was described as “extraordinary”.433 The briefing also stated:
“Saddam has accelerated his efforts to develop a biological, chemical and nuclear
weapons capability since the expulsion of weapons inspectors in 1998, and the
means to deliver them. He is a uniquely dangerous dictator: the only one to have
used WMD against his own people and neighbours.”
795.  Commenting on the preparation of a core script for use when the dossier was
published, Mr Tom Kelly wrote that the “weakness, obviously, is our inability to say
that he could pull the nuclear trigger anytime soon”.434 He thought the basic message,
that “by then it would be too late”, dealt with that point.
796.  Mr Kelly subsequently wrote:
“We should use the full authority of the House to underline the basic message this
is a risk we cannot take. If we put someone on earlier [to make comments before
Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons] there is a danger that the big picture
will get lost in the detail of precisely how long it [would] take for nuclear capacity etc
Instead TB can carry the big message this is a man who will do anything he can not
just to hang on to power, but to impose his will.”435
797.  On 23 September, a draft of Mr Blair’s statement was sent to the Private Offices
of Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Mr Brown, Lord Goldsmith and Sir Andrew Turnbull, and to
Mr Scarlett and Mr Bowen.436 They were asked to identify “any facts that are false and …
any other essential changes that you would like to suggest”.
798.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had “done the statement pretty
much himself”.437

799.  Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:
“… the most important thing was I was very careful in my statement [to Parliament]
to make it clear what we were and were not saying.”438
800.  Asked if there was anything in his statement to Parliament he wanted to
emphasise, Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:
“I think the only thing … is just to emphasise the fact that I make it clear what
I perceived the threat to be.”439
801.  Mr Blair also said:
“… it was essential that anything we said in the course of my statement … we could
hand on heart say: this is the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee.”440
802.  The Iraq Inquiry asked Mr Blair for a statement on who had been involved in the
preparation of his statement, and who had cleared the intelligence it contained.441
803.  Mr Blair wrote:
“In respect of my statement of 24 September 2002 to the House of Commons
I would have relied principally on the dossier and JIC Assessments and written
and oral intelligence briefing, some of which came in just before the statement, in
particular the [9] September JIC Assessment which referred to mobile facilities.”442
804.  Mr Blair added:
“I have gone back, in the course of compiling this statement, to the vast number of
different documents that refer to Saddam and WMD. I simply make the point that
the assumptions in all of them was that Saddam was committed in both the intent
and the action in developing WMD. Of course, the Iraq Survey Group shows that
the intent indeed remained and there were multiple breaches of UN resolutions.”
805.  In his statement to the House of Commons on 24 September, Mr Blair began
by thanking the Speaker for recalling Parliament “to debate the best way to deal with
the issue of the present leadership of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction” and
described the dossier as “detailing the history of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction
programme, its breach of United Nations resolutions and its attempts to rebuild that
illegal programme”.443

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

806.  Addressing the problems encountered by the inspectors, Mr Blair placed the issues
being addressed firmly in the context of:
“… an 11-year history … of UN will flouted, of lies told by Saddam about the
existence of his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and of obstruction,
defiance and denial.
“There is one common, consistent theme … the total determination of Saddam
to maintain that programme; to risk war, international ostracism, sanctions and
the isolation of the Iraqi economy …”
807.  Addressing the question of why Saddam Hussein had decided in mid-September,
but not before, to admit the weapons inspectors, Mr Blair stated the answer was in the
dossier, and it was because:
“… his chemical, biological and nuclear programme is not an historic left-over from
1998. The inspectors are not needed to clean up the old remains. His weapons
of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of
containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not
shut down; it is up and running now.”
808.  Mr Blair stated that the dossier disclosing the intelligence assessments provided
by the JIC had been produced because it was “important to explain our concerns about
Saddam to the British people”. He added that people were going to:
“… have to take elements of this on the good faith of our intelligence services, but
this is what they are telling me … and my senior colleagues. The intelligence picture
that they paint is one accumulated over the last four years. It is extensive, detailed
and authoritative.
“It concludes Iraq has chemical and biological weapons, that Saddam has continued
to produce them, that he has existing and active plans for the use of chemical and
biological weapons, which could be activated within 45 minutes, including against
his own Shia population, and that he is actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons
capability.”
809.  Addressing the content of the dossier, Mr Blair told Parliament that:

•	

As well as the chemical agents and precursor chemicals, growth media for
anthrax and special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents
that were “missing and unaccounted for” in 1998, Iraq continued “to produce
chemical weapons; has rebuilt previously destroyed production plants across
Iraq; has brought dual-use chemical facilities; has retained key personnel …
and has a serious ongoing research programme into weapons production, all
of it well funded”.

270

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•	

•	

“… production of biological agents has continued; facilities formerly used for
biological agents have been rebuilt; equipment has been purchased for such a
programme; and again Saddam has retained the personnel who worked on it
prior to 1991. In particular, the UN inspection regime discovered that Iraq was
trying to acquire mobile biological weapons facilities … Present intelligence
confirms that it has now got such facilities.” The UK believed Iraq could produce
anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin, which “all eventually result in
excruciatingly painful death”.
Saddam Hussein’s previous nuclear programme had been “shut down by
the inspectors” and “known remaining stocks of uranium” were “held under
supervision” by the IAEA. Key personnel who used to work on the nuclear
weapons programme were “back in harness”. “But we now know” that
Saddam Hussein has also:
{{ “bought

or attempted to buy” items that could have a use in a nuclear
programme; and

{{ “been

•	

trying to buy significant quantities of uranium from Africa, although
we do not know whether he has been successful”.

Iraq’s ballistic missile programme was required for the delivery of its chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons. It was “clear that a significant number of
longer-range missiles were effectively concealed from the previous inspectors
and remain, including up to 20 extended-range SCUD missiles … and, by this
year, Iraq’s development of weapons with a range of more than 1,000km was
well under way; and that hundreds of people are employed in that programme,
facilities are being built and equipment procured – usually clandestinely.
Sanctions and import controls have hindered the programme, but only slowed
its progress. The capability being developed, incidentally, is for multi-purpose
use, including with WMD warheads.”

810.  Mr Blair stated:
“That is the assessment, given to me, of the Joint Intelligence Committee. In
addition, we have well founded intelligence to tell us that Saddam sees his WMD
programme as vital to his survival and as a demonstration of his power and influence
in the region.”
811.  Mr Blair added:
“There will be some who dismiss all this. Intelligence is not always right. For some
of the material, there might be innocent explanations. There will be others who say
rightly that … it could be several years before Saddam acquires a usable nuclear
weapon – though if he were able to purchase fissile material … it would be only
a year or two.”

271

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

812.  In the light of the information he had set out, Mr Blair asked whether the world
would be wise to trust to the “good faith of the current Iraqi regime”. Mr Blair added:
“Our case is simply this: not that we take military action come what may, but
that the case for ensuring Iraqi disarmament, as the UN itself has stipulated,
is overwhelming. I defy anyone, on the basis of this evidence, to say that that
is an unreasonable demand for the international community to make when, after
all, it is only the same demand that we have made for 11 years and that Saddam
has rejected.”
813.  Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: ‘Why Saddam?’; ‘Why now?’;
and ‘Why should Britain care?’.
814.  On the question ‘Why Saddam?’, Mr Blair said two things about Saddam stood
out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and he had used
them during the war with Iran “in which one million people died”; and the regime had
“no moderate elements to appeal to”.
815.  On the question ‘Why now?’, Mr Blair stated:
“I agree that I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam
will use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made
the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs
its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a
weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act,
will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy
not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.
“If we take this course and if we refuse to implement the will of the international
community, Saddam will carry on, his efforts will intensify, his confidence will grow
and, at some point in the future not too distant, the threat will turn into reality.
The threat therefore is not imagined. The history of Saddam and weapons of mass
destruction is not American or British propaganda. The history and the present threat
are real.”
816.  Mr Blair said that Britain should care:
“‘Because there is no way this man, in this region … could begin a conflict using
such weapons and the consequences not engulf the whole world, including this
country.’ That … is the reason the UN passed its resolutions. That is why it is right
that the UN Security Council again makes its will and its unity clear and lays down a
strong new UN resolution and mandate. Then Saddam will have the choice: comply
willingly or be forced to comply. That is why alongside the diplomacy, there must be
genuine preparedness and planning to take action if diplomacy fails.
“Let me be plain about our purpose. Of course there is no doubt that Iraq, the region
and the whole world would be better off without Saddam. Iraq deserves to be led by

272

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

someone who can abide by international law, not a murderous dictator; by someone
who can bring Iraq back into the international community where it belongs, not …
languishing as a pariah; by someone who can make the country rich and successful,
not impoverished by Saddam’s personal greed; and by someone who can lead
a government more representative of the country as a whole while maintaining
absolutely Iraq’s territorial integrity.
“We have no quarrel; with the Iraqi people. Indeed, liberated from Saddam they
could make Iraq prosperous and a force for good in the Middle East. So the
ending of this regime would be the cause of regret for no one other than Saddam.
But our purpose is disarmament. No one wants military conflict. The whole purpose
of putting this before the UN is to demonstrate the united determination of the
international community to resolve this in the way it should have been resolved
years ago: through a proper process of disarmament under the UN. Disarmament
of all weapons of mass destruction is the demand. One way or another it must be
acceded to.”
817.  Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, said that the “key question” was
whether Saddam Hussein had “the means, the mentality and the motive to pose a
threat to pose a threat to Britain’s national security and the wider international order”.
Mr Duncan Smith concluded that Saddam had the means and mentality. He stated:
“The evidence produced in the Government’s report shows clearly that Iraq is still
pursuing its weapons of mass destruction programme …
“The … dossier confirms that Iraq is self sufficient in biological weapons and
that the Iraqi military is ready to deploy those, and chemical weapons, at some
45 minutes’ notice.”
818.  Addressing whether Saddam Hussein had the motive to strike against Britain,
Mr Duncan Smith stated:
“… I believe that it is fair to assume that he has …
“The report shows that Saddam has illegally retained up to 20 Al Hussein missiles,
with a range of 650km, capable of carrying the various warheads that he needs,
and that he is also developing new ones.”
819.  Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked:
“Does the Prime Minister truly believe that, on the evidence published today,
a sufficient case has now been made that both clarifies Iraq’s present capacity,
as well as its intent?”
820.  Mr Blair responded:
“ … yes I do believe the information we published today shows that there is a
continuing chemical and biological weapons programme, and an attempt by
273

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Saddam Hussein to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. That is what I believe,
and that is the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee – and frankly I
prefer its assessment to the assessment of the Iraqi regime, which, let us say,
on the basis of experience, is not one that should carry a lot of credibility.”
821.  Mr William Hague (Conservative) asked:
“Does the Prime Minister recollect that, in the half-century history of various states
acquiring nuclear capabilities, in almost every case – from the Soviet Union in 1949
to Pakistan in 1998 – their ability to do so had been greatly underestimated and
understated by intelligence sources at the time? Estimates today of Iraq taking
several years to acquire a nuclear device should be seen in that context … [I]s there
not at least a significant risk of the utter catastrophe of Iraq possessing a nuclear
device without warning, some time in the next couple of years? In that case, does
not the risk of leaving the regime on its course today far outweigh the risk of taking
action quite soon?”
822.  Mr Blair responded:
“I entirely agree … For the preparation of the dossier we had a real concern not to
exaggerate the intelligence that we had received. For obvious reasons, it is difficult
to reflect the credibility of the information, and we rate the credibility of what we have
very highly. I say no more than that.
…
“… I entirely agree that the danger of inaction … far outweighs the danger of action.”
823.  Other points made by Mr Blair included:

•	

•	

“… [I]n my judgement, if we do not deal with the proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and their retention by highly unstable states, often with
dictatorial regimes, then perhaps not this year or next, but in the not too distant
future, that problem will explode on to the consciousness of the world. I believe
that passionately, which is why, whatever the issues in relation to Iraq … it is
important to take a stand now and say that, when we have made determinations
on behalf of the international community, we will see them through. If we do not,
the message to Saddam and anyone else will be that they can develop these
weapons with impunity and that the international community lacks the will to deal
with them.”
“… [T]he point is that if we know that someone has weapons of mass
destruction, if they have used them before and if, as a result, the international
community has said they must be disarmed of those weapons, surely the
greatest risk is letting them carry on developing those weapons and not doing
anything about it.”

274

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

•	

•	
•	
•	

“… [I]n the past four or five years the issue of Iraq, weapons inspections and
what to do about that regime has come over my desk pretty much week after
week … [I]t has been there as an issue the whole time … What we know now
from the assessment given by our Joint Intelligence Committee is that the very
thing that we feared is the very thing that the Iraqi regime is working on.”
“What has happened … is that, whether we like it our not, now is the point
of decision.”
“… We have to be clear that the consequences of saying now to Iraq that
we are not going to do anything will be really, really serious.”
“… [W]e have to make the decision, and I do not think we can duck the
consequences of that decision.”

824.  Mr Blair concluded that the threat was not that Saddam Hussein was going
to launch an attack on the UK “tomorrow”:
“… the threat is that within his own region, or outside it given the missile capability
that he is trying to develop, he launches an attack that threatens the stability of that
region and then the wider world. All the evidence that we have is that if there is such
a conflict in that region, we will not be able to stand apart from it.”
ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENT
825.  Mr Blair’s statement about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions included some
judgements that were additional to those in the dossier.
826.  Mr Blair’s categorical statement that the intelligence picture painted by the
JIC over the last four years was “extensive, detailed and authoritative”, was not
an accurate description of the intelligence underpinning the JIC’s assessments.
827.  There are a number of differences between the draft speech and Mr Blair’s
statement to the House of Commons where points of detail were added or changed,
but its structure and key arguments remained.
828.  In the statement, Mr Blair emphasised that the information in the dossier
represented the view of the JIC.
829.  During a debate on Iraq on 22 February 2007, Lord Butler said that Mr Blair’s
statement to Parliament “that the picture painted by our intelligence services was
‘extensive, detailed and authoritative’ … could simply not have been justified by the
material that the intelligence community provided to him.”
830.  The draft of Mr Blair’s statement on 23 September said that the intelligence
picture was “extensive and detailed”. The words “and authoritative” were added
in the final version; it is not clear who made that change or why.

275

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

831.  The JIC Assessments issued since December 1998 could be described as
authoritative. But the gaps and uncertainties in the intelligence which underpinned
them were clearly identified.
832.  The evidence set out earlier in this Section and in Section 4.1 demonstrates that,
since the departure of the weapons inspectors four years earlier, detailed intelligence
had been received on many aspects of Iraq’s activities, and it was more extensive in
some areas than others. The judgement that the intelligence picture was extensive may
also have been influenced by the reporting which had been issued since the end of
August 2002.
833.  Mr Blair characterised Iraq’s activities to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons, and a ballistic missile capability to deliver them, as a “programme” which was
“active, detailed and growing”.
834.  That statement was in the draft of 23 September, and there is no evidence that
Mr Blair was advised to remove it.
835.  The claim that Iraq’s WMD programme was “growing” and that it had recently
accelerated appeared in the briefing material produced by the FCO and No.10 at
that time.
836.  Asked whether the JIC Assessments had said that the WMD threat from Iraq was
growing, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:
“Yes, it was telling me that in two respects …
“First … there were the September JIC assessments that talked of continuing
production of chemical weapons. In other words, this was a continuing process.
But secondly -- and this did have an impact on me at the time, although this
particular piece of intelligence turned out later to be wrong, but at the time,
obviously, we didn’t know that -- on 12 September … I was told and specifically
briefed about these mobile production facilities for biological weapons. So this was
an additional and new factor and this was very much linked to whether and how
Saddam might conceal his activities.”444
837.  In the context of questioning about the intelligence reports received in late August
and early September and what might have been in Mr Blair’s mind when he said that
Iraq’s programmes were growing, Sir John Scarlett stated:
“… I think it is important to state that that was the reporting that he was seeing, and
he was receiving a judgement from the JIC which said that production of agent is
continuing and it’s happening now.

444 

Public hearing, 2 February 2010, pages 87-88.

276

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

“So it is possible … to conclude that if you are being told that the production is
continuing, it’s possible to conclude that therefore the issue is growing …”445
838.  Sir John confirmed that meant the material was accumulating.
839.  Asked about the sourcing for the reports of 11 and 23 September, Sir John replied:
“… that source was not substantiated and it was the first of the reporting to be
withdrawn … in late July 2003.”
840.  Asked whether the SIS reporting, of 11 and 23 September, might have justified
Mr Blair’s use of the word “growing”, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:
“… maybe they account for the Prime Minister saying ‘growing’. I don’t know.
I am not sure whether that is true or not.”446
841.  Mr Blair’s statements in his Foreword to the dossier about the nature of
the threat posed by Iraq to UK interests and that he believed “the assessed
intelligence” had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein had
“continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues
in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons” are addressed earlier in this Section.
842.  The references to Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes in the statement
reflected the material in the Foreword and the dossier.
843.  A reference to material being “missing” as well as “unaccounted for” was new
and implied the material had existed. The word was added to the draft version of
23 September.
844.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September, about Iraq’s efforts
to develop nuclear weapons, Mr Blair said that “we know” Saddam Hussein
“has bought or attempted to buy” material which could be used in a nuclear
weapons programme.
845.  Mr Blair’s description in his evidence to the Inquiry, that the information on
Iraqi procurement activities in the dossier “could indicate a continuing interest in
nuclear weapons” would have been a more accurate description of the position.
846.  In listing Iraq’s attempts to procure prohibited technology and materials which
could be used in a nuclear weapons programme, which had been set out in the dossier
(page 26), Mr Blair stated:
“But we now know the following … Saddam has bought or attempted to buy …”
847.  The dossier said only that intelligence showed “attempts to purchase”.

445 
446 

Private hearing, 5 May 2010, pages 14-15.
Private hearing, 13 July 2002, page 31.

277

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

848.  Mr Blair stated that it would only take Saddam Hussein “a year or two” to acquire
a usable nuclear weapon “if he were able to purchase fissile material illegally”, rather
than the fuller and more cautious assessment in the dossier (page 27) that Iraq would
need “essential components from foreign sources” to produce a warhead as well as
fissile material.
849.  Neither the dossier nor Mr Blair addressed the likelihood of Iraq being able to
procure both fissile material and other essential components.
850.  Mr Blair did not refer to the judgement in the dossier, which reflected the JIC
Assessments on the issue, that “while sanctions remain effective Iraq would not be able
to produce a nuclear weapon”.447 “If”, and only if, sanctions were removed or proved
ineffective, Iraq would then need “at least five years to produce sufficient fissile material
for a weapon”.
851.  Mr Blair also stated that Iraq’s ballistic missile programme was “required for
the delivery of chemical, biological and nuclear programmes” and that it was “clear
that a significant number of longer-range missiles were effectively concealed from the
previous inspectors and remain, including up to 20 extended-range SCUD missiles”.
Subsequently, he added that the ballistic missile capability was “being developed for
multi-purpose use, including with WMD warheads”.
852.  This material was in the draft of 23 September.
853.  The dossier (pages 22-23) stated that Iraq had a “variety of delivery means
available for both chemical and biological agents”. It made no statement about the
delivery of nuclear weapons.
854.  The dossier did not include the reference in the JIC Assessment of 9 September
2002 to an intelligence report that:
“… suggests Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop warheads capable of effectively
disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it would take six months to
overcome the ‘technical difficulties’.”448
855.  There was no mention in the dossier of concealment of longer-range missiles,
other than Iraq’s retention of “up to 20 Al Hussein missiles”.449

856.  Asked whether his statement that the WMD programme was growing applied
to Iraq’s nuclear programme, Mr Blair replied:
“… what was set out in the dossier, and set out in very detailed form, incidentally,
were all the different items that he had been trying to procure, which could indicate
a continuing interest in nuclear weapons.”450
857.  Asked whether it would have taken quite a long time to get from that point to
having a usable nuclear weapon, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:
“… if you ask people about the nuclear weapons capability, for example, in respect
of Iraq, some people would say, ‘Yes, if they are doing it on their own, it is going
to take significant amount of time, but you can foreshorten that time if you buy in
the material’.
“So one of the reasons – and I emphasise again this whole proliferation issue and
AQ Khan in particular – was that it always worried me that any of these countries,
if they were so minded, could step up very quickly and get …”451

The Butler Review conclusions on the JIC authorship of the dossier
858.  In its report, the Butler Review stated:
“We conclude that it was a serious weakness that the JIC’s warnings on
the limitation of the intelligence underlying its judgements were not made
sufficiently clear in the dossier.
“We understand why the Government felt it had to meet the mounting
public and Parliamentary demand for information. We also recognise that
there is a real dilemma between giving the public an authoritative account
of the intelligence picture and protecting the objectivity of the JIC from the
pressures imposed by providing information for public debate. It is difficult
to resolve these requirements. We conclude with the benefit of hindsight,
that making public that the JIC had authorship of the dossier was a mistaken
judgement, though we do not criticise the JIC for taking responsibility for
clearance of the intelligence content of the document. However, in the
particular circumstances, the publication of such a document in the name and
with the authority of the JIC had the result that more weight was placed on the
intelligence than it could bear.”452

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

859.  The Butler Report recommended that governments in the future should make
arrangements to avoid putting the JIC and its Chair into an area of public controversy
and offered suggestions as to how that might be achieved.453
860.  The Report stated:
“… we conclude that if intelligence is to be used more widely … in public
debate in future, those doing so must be careful to avoid its uses and
limitations. It will be essential too, that clearer and more effective dividing
lines between assessment and advocacy are established when doing so.”454
861.  The Government accepted the Committee’s conclusions on the public use of
intelligence in its immediate response to the report and subsequently stated that:
“Any future presentation of intelligence will separate the Government case from the
JIC Assessment.”455

Conclusions
862.  From late February 2002, the UK Government position was that Iraq was a
threat that had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm in accordance with the
obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of
UN inspectors to Iraq.
863.  The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected
both the ingrained belief – that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical
and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible
enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability,
and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment – and the wider
context in which the policy was being discussed with the US.
864.  But it also served to fuel the demand that the Government should publish the
document it was known to have prepared, setting out the reasons why it was so
concerned about Iraq.
865.  In the spring and summer of 2002, senior officials and Ministers took the
view that the Iraq dossier should not be published until the way ahead on the
policy was clearer.
866.  By late August 2002, the Government was troubled by intense speculation
about whether a decision had already been taken to use military force. In

Mr Blair’s words, the US and UK had been “outed” as having taken a decision
when no such decision had been taken.
867.  Mr Blair’s decision on 3 September to announce that the dossier would be
published was a response to that pressure.
868.  The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary (and
public) support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required to
secure Iraq’s disarmament.
869.  The UK Government intended the information and judgements in the Iraq
dossier to be seen to be the product of the JIC in order to carry authority with
Parliament and the public.
870.  SIS was commissioned by No.10 on 4 September to examine whether it had
any additional material which could be included.
871.  Mr Scarlett, as Chairman of the JIC, was given the responsibility for
producing the dossier.
872.  The dossier drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment, ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical
and Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios’, which had been commissioned to
address scenarios for Iraq’s possible use of chemical and biological weapons in
the event of military action, previous JIC Assessments and the report issued by
SIS on 11 September.
873.  The SIS report should have been shown to the relevant experts in the DIS
who could have advised their senior managers and the Assessments Staff.
874.  Expert officials in DIS questioned the certainty with which some of the
judgements in the dossier were expressed. Some of their questions were
discussed during the preparation of the dossier. The text was agreed by
Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence, at the JIC meeting
on 19 September.
875.  There is no evidence that other members of the JIC were aware at the time
of the reservations recorded in the minute by Dr Jones of 19 September and that
written by the chemical weapons expert in his team the following day.
876.  The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is
no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10
improperly influenced the text.
877.  At issue are the judgements made by the JIC and how they and the
intelligence were presented, including in Mr Blair’s Foreword and in his statement
to Parliament on 24 September 2002.

281

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

878.  It is unlikely that Parliament and the public would have distinguished
between the ownership and therefore the authority of the judgements in the
Foreword and those in the Executive Summary and the main body of the dossier.
879.  In the Foreword, Mr Blair stated that he believed the “assessed intelligence”
had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein had “continued to produce
chemical and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop
nuclear weapons, and that he had been able to extend the range of his ballistic
missile programme”. That raises two key questions.

•	
•	

Did Mr Blair’s statements in whole or in part go further than the assessed
intelligence?
Did that matter?

880.  The Inquiry is not questioning Mr Blair’s belief, which he consistently
reiterated in his evidence to the Inquiry, or his legitimate role in advocating
Government policy.
881.  But the deliberate selection of a formulation which grounded the statement
in what Mr Blair believed, rather than in the judgements which the JIC had actually
reached in its assessment of the intelligence, indicates a distinction between his
beliefs and the JIC’s actual judgements.
882.  That is supported by the position taken by the JIC and No.10 officials at the
time, and in the evidence offered to the Inquiry by some of those involved.
883.  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt that Saddam
Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons. The
Executive Summary of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had
“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”. The main text of the
dossier said that there had been “recent” production. It also stated that Iraq had
the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons. It did not say that Iraq had
continued to produce weapons.
884.  Nor had the assessed intelligence established beyond doubt that efforts
to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC stated in the Executive Summary
of the dossier that Iraq had:

•	
•	
•	

made covert attempts “to acquire technology and materials which could
be used in the production of nuclear weapons”;
“sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having
no active nuclear programme that would require it”; and
“recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme”.

282

4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002

885.  But the dossier made clear that, as long as sanctions remained effective,
Iraq could not produce a nuclear weapon.
886.  These conclusions draw on the evidence from the JIC Assessments at the
time and the Executive Summary of the dossier, which are set out in this Section.
They do not rely on hindsight.
887.  The JIC itself should have made that position clear because its ownership
of the dossier, which was intended to inform a highly controversial policy debate,
carried with it the responsibility to ensure that the JIC’s integrity was protected.
888.  The process of seeking the JIC’s views, through Mr Scarlett, on the text of
the Foreword shows that No.10 expected the JIC to raise any concerns it had.
889.  The firmness of Mr Blair’s beliefs, despite the underlying uncertainties, is
important in considering how the judgements in the Foreword would have been
interpreted by Cabinet in its discussions on 23 September and by Parliament.
890.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to
subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, current and potential future
capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq’s weapons
of mass destruction; and that, at some point in the future, that threat would
become a reality.
891.  By the time the dossier was published, President Bush had announced that
the US was seeking action on Iraq through the UN, and Iraq had agreed to the
return of inspectors.
892.  Rather than the debate being framed in terms of the answers needed to the
outstanding questions identified by UNSCOM and the IAEA, including the material
for which UNSCOM had been unable to account, the dossier’s description of
Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK
Government measured Iraq’s future statements and actions and the success of
weapons inspections.
893.  As the next Section of the Report demonstrates, the judgements remained
in place without challenge until the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Iraq’s denials
of the capabilities and intent attributed to it were not taken seriously.
894.  As the flaws in the construct and the intelligence were exposed after the
conflict, the dossier and subsequent statements to Parliament also became the
baseline against which the Government’s good faith and credibility were judged.
895.  There will continue to be demands for factual evidence to explain the
background to controversial policy decisions including, where appropriate,
the explicit and public use of assessed intelligence.

283

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

896.  The Inquiry shares the Butler Review’s conclusions that it was a mistake
not to see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JIC’s assessment
of intelligence and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the
evidence in order to make the case for policy action.
897.  The nature of the two functions is fundamentally different. As can be seen
from the JIC Assessments quoted in, and published with, this report, they contain
careful language intended to ensure that no more weight is put on the evidence
than it can bear. Organising the evidence in order to present an argument in the
language of Ministerial statements produces a quite different type of document.
898.  The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated
the firmness of the evidence about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in order to
influence opinion and “make the case” for action to disarm Iraq has produced
a damaging legacy, including undermining trust and confidence in Government
statements, particularly those which rely on intelligence which cannot be
independently verified.
899.  As a result, in situations where the policy response may involve military
action and the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements
drawn from necessarily incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure
support for the Government’s position and agreement to action.
900.  The explicit and public use of material from JIC Assessments to underpin
policy decisions will be infrequent. But, from the evidence on the compilation of
the September dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be:

•	
•	

The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and
assessment of intelligence from the responsibility for making the
argument for a policy.
The importance of precision in describing the position. In the case of
the September dossier, for instance, the term “programme” was used to
describe disparate activities at very different stages of maturity. There was
a “programme” to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile. There was
no “programme” in any meaningful sense to develop and produce nuclear
weapons. Use of the shorthand CW or BW in relation to Iraq’s capability
obscured whether the reference was to weapons or warfare. Constant use
of the term “weapons of mass destruction” without further clarification
obscured the differences between the potential impact of nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons and the ability to deliver them effectively.
For example, there would be a considerable difference between the effects
of an artillery shell filled with mustard gas, which is a battlefield weapon,
and a long-range ballistic missile with a chemical or biological warhead,
which is a weapon of terror.

284

The need to identify and accurately describe the confidence and
robustness of the evidence base. There may be evidence which is
“authoritative” or which puts an issue “beyond doubt”; but there are
unlikely to be many circumstances when those descriptions could
properly be applied to inferential judgements relying on intelligence.
The need to be explicit about the likelihood of events. The possibility
of Iraq producing and using an improvised nuclear device was, rightly,
omitted from the dossier. But the claim that Iraq could build a nuclear
weapon within one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other
essential components from foreign sources was included without
addressing how feasible and likely that would be. In addition, the
Executive Summary gave prominence to the IISS suggestion that Iraq
would be able to assemble nuclear weapons within months if it could
obtain fissile material, without reference to the material in the main text
of the dossier which made clear that the UK took a very different view.
The need to be scrupulous in discriminating between facts and knowledge
on the one hand and opinion, judgement or belief on the other.
The need for vigilance to avoid unwittingly crossing the line from
supposition to certainty, including by constant repetition of
received wisdom.

901.  When assessed intelligence is explicitly and publicly used to support a
policy decision, there would be benefit in subjecting that assessment and the
underpinning intelligence to subsequent scrutiny, by a suitable, independent
body, such as the Intelligence and Security Committee, with a view to identifying
lessons for the future.

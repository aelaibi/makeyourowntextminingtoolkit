The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Introduction
1.  This Section addresses the final attempts to secure support for the UK, US and
Spanish draft resolution tabled in the Security Council on 7 March 2003 and, when that
failed, the UK Government’s decision to take military action without the support of the
majority of the Security Council.
2.  Other key developments during that time are addressed elsewhere in the
Report, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	

provision of advice by Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, on the legal basis
for military action to secure Iraq’s compliance with its disarmament obligations,
which is addressed in Section 5;
planning for military operations in southern Iraq, which is addressed in
Section 6.2;
UK planning and preparations for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, which are
addressed in Section 6.5; and
assessments and advice on Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic
missile capabilities, its intention to conceal them from inspections and its
intentions for their use in response to a military attack, which are addressed
in Section 4.3. That Section also addresses the withdrawal after the conflict of
three streams of intelligence reporting which had influenced judgements about
Iraq’s capabilities and intentions.

3.  The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the development of the UK Government’s
strategy and options on Iraq before the invasion began, including the way in which the
policy was developed and decisions were taken, are contained in Section 7.

The end of the UN route
4.  In an attempt to secure support in the Security Council for the second
resolution, Mr Blair decided on 8 March to propose delaying a decision and
identifying specific tests as the basis to determine whether Saddam Hussein
intended to co-operate.
5.  Mr Blair began by consulting Mr Ricardo Lagos, the Chilean President, who
agreed the proposal was worth exploring, although he thought more time would
be needed.
6.  The UK’s attempts, during February and early March 2003, to reach agreement
with the US on the text of a draft resolution stating that Iraq had failed to take the final
opportunity to comply with its obligations and to secure international support for that
position, and the opposition of France, Russia and others, are set out in Section 3.7.

402

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

7.  The text of the UK, US and Spanish draft resolution tabled in the Security Council on
7 March called on Iraq “to take the decisions necessary in the interests of its people and
the region”, which was characterised as a strategic decision by Iraq to disarm.
8.  The draft resolution also set a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate its “full,
unconditional, immediate and active co-operation” in accordance with its obligations
and to yield possession of all prohibited items to the UN Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) or the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
9.  In the discussions in New York on 7 March, questions were raised about how
the judgement would be made that Iraq had taken a strategic decision to disarm.1
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, also
advised that benchmarks for Iraqi compliance would need to be agreed to secure the
support of Chile and Mexico for the UK’s proposals.
10.  In his conversation with President Bush on 7 March, Mr Blair emphasised the
importance of securing nine positive votes in the Security Council for Parliamentary
approval for UK military action.2 While the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was
not sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on whether
Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. Mr Blair argued that if Iraq started to
co-operate, the inspectors could have as much time as they liked.
11.  Following up their conversations in the previous week, Mr Blair spoke to President
Lagos on 8 March.3
12.  The draft speaking note produced by Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, suggested that Mr Blair could tell President Lagos that,
after the report to the Security Council on 7 March by Dr Hans Blix, the Executive
Chairman of UNMOVIC:
“… no one believes that Saddam has given immediate, unconditional or full
co-operation and intelligence shows that he has no intention of doing so, but that
he will continue to dribble out concessions under pressure from our military
build-up in order to fool some people and divide international opinion.
“We must not allow ourselves to be fooled. Equally we need to be fair, so that
Saddam genuinely does have a chance for a change of heart to avert military action.
So I have taken on board your point that you need some concrete tests to judge
Saddam by.”

13.  The points in the speaking note also included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

A description of “five key areas and one key test in each area, for Saddam
to meet by 17 March”, which had been “picked out” from the draft “clusters”
document produced by UNMOVIC.4
If Saddam Hussein “had any intention of complying, he would be able to do
these. If he were to do all of them, it would show that he has had a change of
heart, though even then it would not add up to full disarmament.”
The tests were designed to be “as straightforward and concrete as possible”.
The “onus” was “on Saddam to prove his innocence, not on us to prove
his guilt”.

14.  It was clear in Mr Blair’s discussion with President Lagos on 8 March that Chile did
not support the approach in the draft resolution.5
15.  Mr Blair stated that he had worked out five specific tests. He would send them
to President Lagos, who agreed to discuss the proposals with Mr Vicente Fox, the
Mexican President.
16.  Mr Blair told President Lagos that China would not veto the resolution but France
would; and that he had not given up on persuading Russia to abstain. A “further reason
to want a second resolution, with a gap before the start of military action, was to give the
Arabs a chance to press Saddam to go into exile”.
17.  Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office
Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), subsequently wrote to President Lagos
setting out five tests.6
18.  The first test would be to insist on interviews outside Iraq as specified in resolution
1441. The remaining four tests were “based on” the UNMOVIC “clusters” document and
would require Saddam Hussein “to provide either the material that is unaccounted for,
or to produce full documentation proving its destruction” in respect of:

•	
•	
•	
•	

chemical weapons – “specifically VX”;
biological weapons – “specifically anthrax”;
missiles – “specifically SCUDS”; and
remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs) – “specifically their possible adaptation to
deliver CW [chemical weapons]”.

19.  Sir David stated that Mr Blair believed:
“… that if Saddam Hussein intends to disarm voluntarily, and comply with successive
UN resolutions, he should be ready to co-operate fully in each of these categories.
The Prime Minister also believes that public opinion would see these five demands
as clear and fair tests of Saddam Hussein’s intentions, and ones that can quickly
be met.”
20.  In a further conversation late on 9 March, President Lagos and Mr Blair discussed
the proposed tests.7
21.  Mr Blair agreed that they should check that Dr Blix “did not think the tests were
unreasonable”. If the tests showed that Saddam Hussein was serious about
co-operation, the tests could be followed by a timetable leading to disarmament. The
proposal was “halfway between setting out a detailed time schedule now, which the US
would not agree, and the current situation with its lack of definition of full co-operation”.
22.  Mr Blair also raised the possibility of pushing back the deadline to 24 March, “though
he had not raised this with the US”.
23.  Mr Blair told President Lagos that:
“… he thought we had eight votes. If Mexico and Chile could support the resolution
on the basis of these proposals there would be enormous pressure on Saddam, and
it would be possible that France/Russia would not veto.”
24.  President Lagos agreed the approach was worth exploring, but he would want to
see changes to the wording of the draft ultimatum and an additional week.
25.  On 9 March, Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary,
declared she would resign if the UK took military action against Iraq without
UN authority.
26.  In an interview for BBC Radio 4’s Westminster Hour broadcast on 9 March,
Ms Clare Short said she would resign from the Government if the UK took military action
against Iraq without UN authority.8
27.  Asked whether she thought Mr Blair had acted “recklessly”, Ms Short described the
situation as “extraordinarily reckless”.
28.  In response to further questions Ms Short said:

•

“… what worries me is that we’ve got the old spin back and we have detailed
discussions either personally or in the Cabinet and then the spin the next day is:
‘we’re ready for war’.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“If it takes another month or so, that is fine …”

•	

“And there’s another major legal point – if there isn’t a UN mandate for the
reconstruction of Iraq … It will in international law be an occupying army and
won’t have the authority to make changes in the administrative arrangements
in Iraq.”

“… I think you could get a world where we see the UN in authority … proper care
for the people of Iraq, because at the moment the preparations to care for the
humanitarian aftermath of any military conflict are not properly in place.”

29.  Ms Short informed Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications
and Strategy, and Mr Suma Chakrabarti, the Department for International Development
(DFID) Permanent Secretary, of her action as soon as the interview had been recorded.9
30.  Ms Short wrote in her memoir that she:
“… had decided war was unstoppable. I had experienced enough wars to know that
it was too late to criticise when our troops were on the ground …”10
31.  Ms Short also wrote that her diary entry for 9 March read:
“TB [Mr Blair] rang, furious. Said I am undermining his delicate negotiations …
“… I said sorry to upset but doing what I think right, no good resigning after war
started. He said 7 days yet, can’t leave that man there.”
32.  Mr Robin Cook, who in March 2003 was Leader of the House of Commons, wrote
that on 10 March he had agreed with Ms Hilary Armstrong, the Chief Whip, that, on
13 March, he would announce a debate on Iraq for the following week.11
33.  No.10 officials emphasised to their counterparts in the White House the
crucial importance of securing nine votes in support of a resolution in the
Security Council.
34.  The UK thought that more time, possibly until the end of March, could be
needed to build support.
35.  Sir David Manning told Dr Condoleezza Rice, the US National Security Advisor, that
he thought they were “still short of nine votes” for the draft resolution.12 Chile and Mexico
“would probably abstain” and China “might veto in French and Russian company”. There
was “an increasingly difficult domestic political background”, which “re-emphasised how
crucial it was to secure nine votes”. Time would be a factor in that.

36.  Sir David argued that the US and UK “should be ready to oblige if what they wanted
was another ten days, or the end of the month”. That would be:
“… a small price to pay for securing the nine votes that were needed if UK forces
were to participate in military action, and if we were to be sure that the Prime
Minister could survive a vote in the House of Commons. Obviously these were
our priorities … It did not make sense to give the military timetable precedence
over the political realities … I could not believe that the military planning could
not be massaged to allow more time if there was a chance that this would make
the difference.”
37.  Sir David commented that he had:
“… laid it on the line this evening. I left Condi [Dr Rice] in no doubt about our political
difficulties; and … that the Administration should be ready to make concessions on
test/benchmarks and on timing if that was what it took to get nine votes …”
38.  The timing of the vote on a second a resolution and for a Parliamentary debate
in the UK, and the potential difficulties of securing nine votes in the Security Council
and a majority in Parliament, were discussed in a subsequent conference call between
Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, Mr Campbell and Sir David Manning and
the White House.13
39.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that the White House had said that:
“… if we got a majority with vetoes, Bush wanted to go straight in, within days, even
short of the March 17 deadline, would say the UN had failed to act, and get going,
on the basis of 1441. We made the point that we needed a second resolution.
Without it we had real problems in Parliament. They said continually that they
wanted to help us but of course what they really wanted was the use of our forces.
“Jonathan and I continually emphasised we needed the second resolution. We
had seven definite votes still, but Condi was less confident re Chile and Mexico …
They [the US] basically wanted by Tuesday/Wednesday to say we had exhausted
every effort and now the diplomatic window had closed. We said that if we got the
majority for a second resolution, even with vetoes we would have to go through
with it, including the timetable. Andy Card [President Bush’s Chief of Staff] said he
feared the President’s response would be ‘Here we go, another final opportunity, a
final final opportunity and this time we really mean it.’ I said TB’s job was on the line
and we did not want to lose him. ‘No, nor do we’, said Condi. I think our concern was
probably deeper.”14

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

40.  Mr Blair left President Bush in no doubt that he needed a second resolution
to secure Parliamentary support for UK involvement in military action and sought
support for his initiative of setting out tests in a side statement, including that the
vote in the Security Council might have to be delayed “by a couple of days”.
41.  Offered the opportunity not to take military action, Mr Blair assured President
Bush the UK would be with the US “if he possibly could be”.
42.  President Bush was evidently unwilling to countenance delay and was
reported to have told Mr Blair that, if the second resolution failed, he would find
another way to involve the UK.
43.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position late on 9 March, including the
positions of Mexico and Chile.15
44.  Mr Blair told President Bush that he was working with President Lagos on identifying
tests for compliance in five specific areas and suggested that they (the US and the UK)
should consider delaying the vote by a couple of days.
45.  Mr Blair told President Bush that “he [Mr Blair] would be with the US if he possibly
could be”.
46.  Mr Rycroft recorded that President Bush responded that if the second resolution
failed, he would find another way to involve the UK. He would “rather go alone militarily
than have the British Government fall”.
47.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that he told Mr Blair he would “rather have
him drop out of the Coalition and keep his government than try to stay in and lose it”;
and that Mr Blair said, “I’m with you … I absolutely believe in this. I will take it up to the
very last”.16
48.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“TB started by saying he was ‘fighting on all fronts’. ‘Attaboy’ came the reply, a bit
too patronisingly for my tastes. TB said one of his Ministers was threatening to
resign, also that Chirac [Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President] told Lagos that
the Africans were ‘in the bag’ … TB had spoken to four of the leaders who made
up the 8 plus 1. Musharraf [Mr Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani President] was
with us but it was difficult for him. Cameroon said absolutely. Guinea’s Foreign
Minister coming tomorrow. Dos Santos [Mr José Eduardo Dos Santos, the Angolan
President] solid.
“TB was doing most of the talking … He felt Bush needed to work some more on
Fox. He felt if we could get them to accept the idea of the tests, other countries

would also come with us. But Bush said he was already putting enormous pressure
on Mexico. He said he had also been twisting Lagos’ arm …
“Bush not happy. Bush said Saddam was very adept at exploiting weakness and Blix
was weak. These countries need to see that we want to do this peacefully. He wants
the vote to go through but not on an unreasonable basis.
“TB said the public opinion problem stemmed from people feeling the US wanted
a war. We have to put up the genuine tests of disarmament, show the determination
to try to do this peacefully.
“Bush said he had never come across a situation where the dividing line between
success and failure was so narrow. He said he wanted it done peacefully, or any
other way. His tone was very different to TB’s. Bush was talking the diplomatic talk
while clearly very irritated by the whole thing. His worry was that we were negotiating
with ourselves, that we got a resolution with a timeframe, everything we want, and
we get nothing for it. He said he couldn’t believe Chirac said he had the Africans in
the bag. ‘I can’, said TB. ‘I have a lot of experience of them.’
“He [Bush] was clearly aware of how tough things were getting for TB. He said if
the swing countries didn’t vote with us ‘my last choice is for your Government to
go down. That is the absolute last thing I want to have happen. I would rather go it
alone than have your Government fall.’ ‘I appreciate that’, said TB. ‘I really mean
that’ said Bush. TB said it was also important that he understood that he really
believed in what they were trying to do. Bush – ‘I know that but I am not going to
see your Government fall on this.’
“TB said ‘I’ve got our troops there too. If I can’t get this through Parliament, we fall,
and that’s not exactly the regime change I want. We have to work out what Chile and
Mexico need.’
“They agreed to speak again to Lagos and to Fox. TB said we were in high-risk,
high-reward territory. Bush said he was being eroded domestically by inactivity.
He also said he felt the hardest part would be after Saddam. Then Bush did a
number on the changes in the Arab world that could follow.
“TB said the biggest concern in not going with the UN was the lack of support
if things went wrong. Tommy Franks [General Franks, Commander in Chief US
Central Command (CENTCOM)] had said ninety per cent of precision bombs are
precise. That leaves ten per cent.
“But Bush was left in no doubt TB would be with him when the time came.
“Bush said ‘I’m not going to let you down. Hang on in there buddy. You are
doing great.’

409

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“What had been interesting was that Bush listened far more intently to TB. TB did
not make too much of his own problems, and was stressing he thought we were
doing the right thing.”17
49.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK
on identifying tests “as long as the bar was not out of reach of a complying Iraq”.
50.  Dr Blix had reminded Sir Jeremy that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence that
Iraq possessed any weapons of mass destruction (WMD).
51.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock met Dr Blix late on 9 March to explore whether the various
ideas for an ultimatum combined with specific tests for Iraq could be made part of a new
UN resolution.18
52.  Sir Jeremy told Dr Blix that the “risk of failure on our current draft was high enough
for another way forward to be contemplated”. The UK might now be prepared “to set
Saddam a series of tests, with dates set for him to meet specific requirements. If he
failed at any stage, the final opportunity would be lost”. It would be important to devise
tests that set the bar high, and not to lower them “in the face of Iraqi bluster”. The UK
needed a professional judgement from Dr Blix on which areas should be set as tests.
53.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was prepared to work with the UK on a series of
tests over timed periods “as long as the bar was not out of reach of a complying Iraq”;
and that he had assured Dr Blix that that was not the UK’s objective. The US still had
to be persuaded, “but that was our job”.
54.  Dr Blix had also reminded Sir Jeremy “that UNMOVIC still lacked clear evidence
that Iraq possessed any WMD at all”.
55.  Following discussion of the details, Sir Jeremy commented that:
“… subject to further thoughts from UNMOVIC … a convincing test by, say 21 March
would comprise:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Interviews [outside Iraq], accepting UNMOVIC’s lower number, with a venue of
either Larnaca or Bahrain, and adding a warning about intimidation.
RPVs and spray tanks [for possible delivery of chemical or biological agent]:
full documentation and explanations.
Completion of the Al Samoud destruction (since they are obviously keeping
some for a conflict).
A convincing public statement by Saddam.”

56.  The FCO suggested some changes to the tests identified by No.10.

57.  Mr Tim Dowse, Head of the FCO Non-Proliferation Department, wrote to Mr Peter
Ricketts, FCO Political Director, on 10 March, commenting that the No.10 benchmarks
“more or less” overlapped with a version he had produced, but cautioning against setting
a figure on the number of scientists to be interviewed outside Iraq.19 In Mr Dowse’s view
there was “no magic in 150”; UNMOVIC could not handle that number.
58.  Mr Dowse also commented that:

•	
•	
•

•	

The tests on biological programmes might include growth media as well as
anthrax. Iraq had admitted possessing material “as recently as 1999” and it was
“simply not credible that all documentation has disappeared in such a short
space of time”.
He had “included the mobile bio-labs mainly because they’ve had so much
publicity”, and there was “fairly firm intelligence about them”; but if Iraq refused
to admit their existence, the UK was “in a bind, because we are unlikely to be
able to prove they do exist. So perhaps we should drop them.”
He had included bombs and shells because they were “concrete things, more
easily visualised than VX”, and there was “less room for argument over whether
they have been destroyed or not” in the light of the “scope for Iraqi obfuscation
over destruction of VX”.
The problem with “almost any benchmark relating to SCUD-type missiles” was
that Iraq had claimed they were destroyed and “we can’t prove the contrary”.
Demands for the 50 SCUD warheads which were “unaccounted-for” faced the
same problem.
He thought accelerated destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles and the
associated production equipment, including “the test stand [at al-Rafah] if Blix
agrees”, would be a better test.
The No.10 benchmark on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) was “a poor one”
referring to a programme in the 1990s. It would be better “to use the ‘drone with
a wingspan of 7.45 metres’ which UNMOVIC have just discovered” which had
not been declared by Iraq and which the US was “pretty confident” was an illegal
system which they thought they had tracked “flying over 500km”.
His preference was to pitch the test more widely for the destruction of “all UAVs
with CBW applications”.

59.  Mr Ricketts sent the comments to Mr Rycroft, observing that there were some good
comments and Mr Dowse was available to be used for further drafting.20
60.  In his discussion with Mr Blair, Dr Blix appears to have been ambivalent about
the specifics of the UK’s proposed tests.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

61.  In preparation for a telephone call to Dr Blix on 10 March, Mr Rycroft advised
Mr Blair that he could not allow the proposals for tests to be watered down and that
initial tests would show whether there was a change of heart to allow full co-operation.21
Mr Blair might need to remind Dr Blix that his 7 March report had noted that Iraq should
be able to provide more documentary evidence; and that where documents were not
available, interviews could be another way to obtain evidence.
62.  Mr Blair told Dr Blix that “the only way to avoid immediate conflict and allow more
time for inspections was to lay down a set of tests … If these were met, we could
establish a future work programme.”22 He did not know if the US would agree the
approach and could try to “extend the 17 March deadline a bit”.
63.  In the discussion of the possible tests, Dr Blix noted that it would not be possible
for Iraq to “yield up” all its WMD by 17 March, as proposed in the draft resolution.
The proposed test on anthrax would also be difficult. He suggested the addition of the
complete destruction of Al Samoud missiles.
64.  Dr Blix wrote that he had been invited to the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in
New York to take a call from Mr Blair at 1.30pm London time.23 Mr Blair had said “they
needed five or six items on which the Iraqis would demonstrate their compliance with
UNMOVIC’s work programme”. The items the UK had been considering “included
accounting for anthrax, the chemical agents VX and mustard, SCUD missiles and
remotely piloted vehicles: and promising genuine co-operation with UNMOVIC’s plans
to take scientists (along with their families) for interviews outside Iraq”.
65.  Dr Blix wrote that: “The process could not go on until April/May but perhaps it could
extend a few days beyond March 17.”
66.  Dr Blix added that he had told Mr Blair that all the “items” he had mentioned would
fall within the list of unresolved disarmament issues, but: “Whether they would all be
among the key issues we would select, I could not yet say with certainty.”
67.  Dr Blix commented that he had “sensed” that Mr Blair had “found it hard to
persuade the US to go along”.

Mr Straw’s statement, 10 March 2003
68.  Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, told the House of Commons on
10 March that the choice lay between standing firm and giving Saddam Hussein
a deadline for compliance or a return to the “failed policy” of containment.
69.  Mr Straw made an oral statement to the House of Commons on 10 March in
which he described the reports to the Security Council on 7 March by Dr Blix and
Minute Rycroft to Prime Minister, 10 March 2003, ‘Blix Call’.

Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA, and the provisions of the
revised draft resolution, tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March, giving the Iraqi
regime a deadline by which it was required to demonstrate that it was prepared to
disarm peacefully.24
70.  Mr Straw emphasised that resolution 1441, giving “Iraq a ‘final opportunity’ to
comply with a series of disarmament obligations” had been adopted four months
previously; and that, during the debate in the Security Council:
“… not a single speaker claimed that Iraq was in compliance with those obligations;
neither did a single speaker deny that Iraq has been in flagrant breach of
international law for the past 12 years.”
71.  Mr Straw welcomed Dr ElBaradei’s report that “the IAEA had found no evidence
or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons programme in Iraq”.
72.  Dr Blix, “on the other hand”, had “reported movement in some limited areas: for
example the partial destruction of prohibited Al Samoud missiles”. But that was “only
the tip of the iceberg of Iraq’s illegal weapons programme”, and the “full extent of the
iceberg was revealed” in an UNMOVIC document, Unresolved Disarmament Issues:
Iraq’s Proscribed weapons Programmes, which had now been made public.25 Mr Straw
described the document as setting out, in “173 pages of painstaking detail, the terrible
nature of the weapons Saddam has sought with such determination to develop”.
It was “a catalogue of evasion, deceit and feigning co-operation while in reality pursuing
concealment”. The “sheer scale of Iraq’s efforts to develop and hide” its weapons could
“be grasped only by reading the whole document”.
73.  Citing the potential impact of “tiny amounts” of anthrax, Mr Straw stated that:
“Contrary to Iraqi assertions”, the inspectors found evidence of anthrax where Iraq
had declared there was none. There was “a strong presumption that some 10,000
litres of anthrax” had not been destroyed and “may still exist”, and Iraq possessed “the
technology and materials to allow it to return swiftly to the pre-1991 production levels”.
74.  Addressing the suggestions that inspections should be given more time, and
specifically the memorandum produced by France, Germany and Russia on 5 March,
Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein was “a master at playing for time” and that
continuing inspections “with no firm end date” would “not achieve the disarmament
required by the Security Council”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

75.  Challenging Iraq’s claim that it had no weapons of mass destruction, Mr Straw
said it was:
“… the same old refrain that we have heard … for the past 12 years. Yet whenever
the inspectors have caught the regime out, it has first protested, then conceded that
narrow point, but then mendaciously claimed that there are no more.”
76.  Characterising the choice to be made as whether to “stand firm” in pursuing
the objective of disarmament or settling for a policy which would “in truth” allow
Saddam Hussein to:
“… rebuild his arsenal under cover of just enough co-operation to keep the
inspectors tied down for years to come. We should not deceive ourselves.
The alternative proposals before the Security Council amount to a return to the
failed policy of so-called containment. But the truth is that containment can never
bring disarmament, nor is it the policy of the United Nations as expressed in
resolution 1441 and in all the preceding resolutions going back to 1991.”
77.  Stating that the reality was that Saddam Hussein only responded to pressure, and
therefore that that pressure should be increased, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein
had to be put to the test. The initiative to produce the revised resolution tabled in
the Security Council on 7 March stemmed from the Government’s “desire to secure
a peaceful outcome”. Negotiations on the detail were continuing and the UK was
“examining whether a list of defined tests for Iraqi compliance would be useful in helping
the Security Council to come to a judgement”.
78.  Mr Straw said that he profoundly hoped that the Iraqi regime would “even at this
late stage, seize the chance to disarm peacefully”. He added: “The only other peaceful
alternative would be for Saddam Hussein to heed the calls of a number of other Arab
leaders for him to go into exile and to hand over to a new leadership prepared to
conform with the Council’s demands.” If Saddam Hussein refused to co-operate, the
Security Council “had to face up to its clear responsibilities” under the UN Charter.
79.  Addressing the potential consequences of military action, Mr Straw stated that the
international community would have “a duty to build a secure, prosperous future for the
Iraqi people”. In his meeting with Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, on 6 March,
he had proposed “that the UN should take the lead role in co-ordinating international
efforts to rebuild Iraq, and that they should be underpinned by a clear UN mandate”.
80.  Mr Straw acknowledged the fear that action on Iraq might “exacerbate tensions
elsewhere in the region”, and emphasised the need for progress in restoring a
meaningful peace process between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. He concluded:
“A lasting settlement in the Middle East will remove one great threat to security …
In confronting the danger from Iraq’s weapons, the UN can remove another great
threat. We must not let Saddam turn his ‘final opportunity’ to disarm … into endless

414

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

opportunities to delay. The future not only of the region but of UN authority is
at stake.”
81.  Mr Michael Ancram (Conservative), described the Iraq situation as outlined by
Mr Straw as “grim” and encouraged the Government, in response to the serious
questions and doubts about whether the case for action had been made, to “ensure
that the case for action continues to be made and strongly”, and to produce more of
the information it had for the British people to absorb.
82.  Asked by Mr Ancram what the Government’s position would be in the event
that three Permanent Members of the Security Council vetoed a second resolution,
Mr Straw replied:
“We have made it clear throughout that we want a second resolution for political
reasons, because a consensus is required, if we can achieve it, for any military
action. On the legal basis for that, it should be pointed out that resolution 1441 does
not require a second resolution …”
83.  Mr Michael Moore (Liberal Democrat) asked Mr Straw to accept that there were
“still diplomatic and political options open to the international community and that the
military agenda must not dictate the calendar for inspections”; and if he believed that
“war should be the last resort”. Threatening to ignore the United Nations undermined
the principles of international law.
84.  Mr Straw responded that war was and “should always be a last resort”. The UK
was not ignoring the UN. Mr Blair had “moved heaven and earth to ensure that the
whole issue of Iraq” was “dealt with through the United Nations”.
85.  Asked by Mr Simon Thomas (Plaid Cymru) to remind the House “exactly … which
part of resolution 1441 authorises war”, Mr Straw said:
“I am delighted to do so. We start with paragraph 1, which says that the Security
Council ‘Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations
under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 … in particular through Iraq’s
failure to co-operate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to complete
the actions required under paragraph 8 to 13 of resolution 687’.
“We then go to paragraph 4, in which the Security Council ‘Decides that false
statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this
resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in
the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of
Iraq’s obligations’ – obligations of which it is now in breach. We turn to operative
paragraph 13, in which the Security Council ‘Recalls, in that context, that the Council
has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its
continued violations of its obligations’.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS IN NEW YORK
86.  Reporting informal consultations in New York on 10 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
said that he had drawn the attention of the Security Council to Mr Straw’s statement and
the reference to work on a list of defined tests.26 That had “caused a fair bit of interest”.
87.  Sir Jeremy also reported that, in response to questions, the points made by
Dr Blix included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	

40 interviews had been requested and 15 had been conducted “to
UNMOVIC’s modalities”.
The RPV UNMOVIC had discovered was important and should have been
declared. UNMOVIC was examining whether it was proscribed.
52 Al Samoud 2 missiles had been destroyed.
It was difficult for him to assess the regional threat posed by WMD. There were
no confirmed cases of its existence and UNMOVIC had never maintained Iraq
had them. But the clusters document recorded Iraqi deceit; repeated Full, Final
and Complete Disclosures (FFCDs); hide and seek and cheating in the past.
There were a lot of accounting problems.
UNMOVIC was not expressing any low regard for intelligence agencies but no
WMD had been found as a result of tips on location. Part of the reason might be
that intelligence was gathered at levels which did not deal with actual storage.
Experience showed that it was possible that Iraq could have mobile
biological facilities.

88.  Mr Blair failed to secure unqualified support from President Lagos for
his approach.
89.  Mr Blair spoke twice to President Lagos on 10 March in an attempt to find a path
both President Lagos and President Fox could support.
90.  In the first telephone call, before a conversation with Dr Blix, Mr Blair reported
Dr Blix’s response to Sir Jeremy Greenstock on the draft tests.27
91.  In the second conversation, Mr Blair reported progress on the three areas President
Lagos had raised:

•	
•	

26 
27 

Sir Jeremy Greenstock had worked up an agreed text with UNMOVIC identifying
a set of concrete tests on which to judge Iraqi compliance.
Mr Blair thought it “would be possible to find different wording” on the ultimatum
to Iraq.

Timing “would be difficult, but he would try to get some flexibility” if the first two
issues “fell into place”.28

92.  If Mr Blair knew he had Chilean and Mexican support, the UK would share the ideas
with France and Russia.
93.  President Lagos’ response was positive although he did not agree to support the
resolution. Mr Blair offered to visit Chile if that would be helpful.
94.  Mr Campbell wrote that President Lagos had said he was “eighty per cent there but
worried about France and Russia”.29
95.  By 10 March, President Bush’s position was hardening. He was very
reluctant to delay action.
96.  Reporting a conversation at 9.30pm on 10 March, Mr Straw told Sir David Manning
that Mr Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, thought that there were seven solid
votes, and uncertainty about Mexico, Chile and Pakistan.30 If there were fewer than nine,
the second resolution should not be put to the vote.
97.  Mr Straw had responded that “he was increasingly coming to the view that we
should not push the matter to a vote if we were going to be vetoed”; but that had not yet
been agreed by Mr Blair.
98.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed the “seven solid votes”
for the resolution.31 Mr Blair planned to speak to President Musharraf the following day.
Mr Blair outlined the tests and his efforts to secure support from Chile and Mexico.
They would not support a Spanish proposal simply to affirm resolution 1441.
99.  In his account of the conversation, Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had done most
of the talking.32 President Bush thought that there were “seven votes solid ‘locked up’,
but Pakistan and the Latins were difficult”; and that President Chirac was “trying to get
us to the stage where we would not put [the resolution] to a vote because we would be
so worried about losing”. Mr Campbell added that he “could sense in his voice and the
manner of the discussion that [President] Bush was less emollient than yesterday”.
100.  In answer to a question from President Bush about the timeframe for his proposal,
Mr Blair had “said they [Chile and Mexico] would want to kick us back a few days as a
way of showing they got something out of this”. Mr Blair had argued that if Chile and

Mexico could be shifted, that would “change the weather”. If France and Russia then
vetoed the resolution but the “numbers were right on the UN”, Mr Blair thought that
he would “have a fighting chance of getting it through the Commons”. Subsequently,
Mr Blair had suggested that a change in Chile and Mexico’s position might be used
to influence Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President.
101.  President Bush was “worried about rolling in more time” but Mr Blair had “held his
ground”, arguing that Chile and Mexico would “need to be able to point to something that
they won last minute that explains why they finally supported us”. President Bush “said
‘Let me be frank. The second resolution is for the benefit of Great Britain. We would
want it so we can go ahead together.’” President Bush’s position was that the US and
the UK “must not retreat from 1441 and we cannot keep giving them more time”; it was
“time to do this” and there should be “no more deals”.
102.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair concluded the conversation by saying “he was
sure we were doing the right thing and we had to see it through, but it was going to be
tough”. President Bush had replied: “Hang on in there friend.”
103.  Mr Campbell wrote that he “felt a bit sick” about “the extent to which our problems
were US-created, and our politics now so dominated by their approach”.
104.  Sir David Manning sent the UK’s proposals for a revised deadline and a side
statement identifying six tests on which Saddam Hussein’s intentions would be
judged to Dr Rice and to President Lagos.
105.  Reflecting some of the comments from Dr Blix and Mr Dowse, Sir David Manning
wrote to Dr Rice setting out six proposed tests, with additional details in a “draft side
statement”, which Mr Blair had “briefly described” to President Bush:

•	

a public statement in Arabic by Saddam Hussein announcing that:
{{ Iraq

had in the past sought to conceal its WMD and other proscribed
activities but had taken a strategic decision not to produce or retain them;

{{ Iraq

would immediately yield all prohibited and proscribed material to the
weapons inspectors;

{{ Iraq

would co-operate fully with UNMOVIC and the IAEA in immediately
addressing and resolving all outstanding questions; and

{{ all

•	

government personnel and citizens would cease any proscribed activity
and provide items, documentation and information to the inspectors;

undertakings to:
{{ make

at least 30 Iraqi scientists available for interview outside Iraq;

{{ surrender

all remaining anthrax and anthrax production capability
(including growth media) and provide credible evidence to account for
outstanding questions on production and destruction;

{{ surrender

all mobile bio-production laboratories for destruction;

418

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

{{ destroy

all Al Samoud 2 missiles and components; and

{{ account

for the purpose of all UAV and RPV programmes.33

106.  The draft side statement was also sent to President Lagos.
107.  Sir David informed Dr Rice that Mr Blair was willing to consider a redraft of
operative paragraph (OP) 3 of the draft resolution (tabled by the UK, US and Spain
on 7 March), which “might read”:
“decides that Iraq will have failed to take the final opportunity unless by X date it
shows that it has demonstrated that it is co-operating fully, unconditionally and
immediately with its disarmament obligations under UNSCR 1441.”
108.  The decision on Iraq’s co-operation would be taken on the basis of Iraq’s response
to the six tests.
109.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that President Bush and his military were concerned
about delay:
“It [the proposal for tests/more time] was indeed a hard sell to George. His system
was completely against it. His military were, not unreasonably, fearing that delay
gave the enemy time – and time could mean a tougher struggle and more lives lost.
This was also troubling my military. We had all sorts of contingency plans in place
for what Saddam might do. He might set the oilfields on fire, release chemical, or
worse, biological material, or attack Israel. His past record gave us no confidence in
his trustworthiness or his humanity. There was both UK and US intelligence warning
us of the risk.
“Nonetheless I thought it was worth a try …
“I set out my case for delay in a Note to George. We then had a call. It was tricky but
I laid it on the line and reluctantly he agreed. We got the document prepared with the
Blix people. It had five crucial tests in it. It would, especially on the interview, have
flushed out the regime thoroughly on what they were hiding and on whether they
had any good faith.
“Chile and Mexico were prepared to go along, but only up to a point. Ricardo made
it clear that if there was heavy opposition from France, it would be tough for them to
participate in what would then be a token vote, incapable of being passed because
of a veto – and what’s more, a veto not by Russia, but by France.
“Unfortunately, the French position had, if anything, got harder not softer. They
were starting to say they would not support military action in any circumstances,
irrespective of what the inspectors found …”34

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

110.  In a press conference on 10 March, Mr Annan reiterated the Security
Council’s determination to disarm Iraq, but said that every avenue for a peaceful
resolution of the crisis had to be exhausted before force should be used.
111.  Mr Annan also warned that if the Security Council failed to agree on a
common position, and action was taken without the authority of the Council,
the legitimacy and support for any such action would be seriously impaired.
112.  During a press conference in The Hague on 10 March, Mr Annan made a short
statement on the position on Iraq.35
113.  Mr Annan warned that the “atmosphere of crisis and great anxiety” was “affecting
the whole world”, and that:
“The question of Iraq’s disarmament has brought the international community to
a dangerous point of division and discord …
“… the threat of weapons of mass destruction. It is an issue of the utmost gravity
– by no means confined to Iraq. The whole international community needs to act
together to curb the proliferation of these terrible weapons, wherever it is happening.
“The determination of the Security Council to disarm Iraq of such weapons is the
most urgent issue – because Iraq has actually used such weapons in the past, and
because it has twice committed aggression against its neighbours … On this critical
question, there are no divisions, no grounds for doubt, dispute or delay.
“… people want to see this crisis resolved peacefully. There is widespread concern
about the long term consequences of war in Iraq for the fight against terrorism;
for the Middle East Peace Process [MEPP]; and for the world’s ability to address
common concerns in the future if deep divisions are sowed today between nations
and between people of different religions.
“Indeed, one must have no illusions about what war means. In certain circumstances
the use of force may be necessary to secure a lasting peace. But the reality is
that it would cause great human suffering, whether it is long or short; that it may
lead to regional instability and economic crises; and it can … lead to unintended
consequences producing new threats and new dangers.
“War must always be a last resort – arrived at only if and when every reasonable
avenue of achieving Iraq’s disarmament by peaceful means has been exhausted.
The United Nations … has a duty to search till the very end for the peaceful
resolution of conflicts.”

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

114.  Mr Annan added:
“The members of the Security Council now face a great choice. If they fail to agree
on a common position, and action is taken without the authority of the Security
Council, the legitimacy and support for any such action will be seriously impaired.
If, on the other hand, they can … address this threat in a united manner and ensure
compliance with their previous resolutions, then the Security Council’s authority will
be enhanced, and the world will be a safer place.
“… Iraq does not exist in a vacuum. What happens there will have profound
implications … for other issues of great importance … The broader the consensus
on Iraq, the better the chance that we can come together again and deal effectively
with other burning conflicts, starting with the one between Israelis and Palestinians.
Only a just resolution of that conflict can bring peace and stability in the region.
“… the success or failure of the international community in dealing with Iraq will
crucially affect its ability to deal with … conflicts …”
115.  Mr Annan concluded:
“However this conflict is resolved, the United Nations will remain as important as it
is today.
“We have seen in recent months what an immense significance States and people
around the world attach to the legitimacy provided by the … Security Council, and
the United Nations, as the common framework for securing the peace. As they
approach their grave decision, I must solemnly urge all members of the … Council
to keep this in mind, and to be worthy of the trust in them that the world’s peoples
have shown.”
116.  Asked whether an attack on Iraq without a second resolution would be a breach of
the UN Charter, Mr Annan responded:
“… the Charter is very clear on circumstances under which force can be used. I think
the discussion … is to ensure that the … Council, which is the master of its own
deliberations, is able to pronounce itself on what happens. If the US and others were
to go outside the Council and take military action it would not be in conformity with
the Charter.”

President Chirac’s interview, 10 March 2003
117.  Sir John Holmes, the British Ambassador to France, reported on 10 March
that, after the debate in the Security Council on 7 March, France believed it had the
momentum.36 The press and public were firmly behind President Chirac. France was

36 

Telegram 123 Paris to FCO London, 10 March 2003, ‘Iraq: French Reaction to 7 March Debate’.

421

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“impervious” to the UK’s arguments, although that “could still change if it looks as if
we might secure the nine votes and avoid Russian and Chinese vetoes”.
118.  Sir John reported that France’s strategy remained:
“(a) to persuade us not to go for a vote, (b) if this did not work, to stop us from
securing nine votes, and (c) if there are nine votes, to ensure that they have Russian
and Chinese company in vetoing.”
119.  France was “on the diplomatic offensive”. Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French
Foreign Minister, was visiting Angola, Cameroon and Guinea and President Chirac was
“canvassing support” for a Security Council meeting at Head of State level for a vote
on Iraq.
120.  Sir John commented:
“Although the French have still so far steered clear of saying in so many words that
they will veto, it is hard to interpret their comments and approach in any other way …
It is getting increasingly difficult for the French to backtrack now, having built up so
many expectations domestically and internationally. Whilst we are both fully engaged
in our respective lobbying campaigns there is little we can say to them likely to have
much impact …
“I doubt that benchmarks and a little more time will do the trick … That said, the
dynamics may yet change this week … In any case, going to a vote without at least
some Prime Ministerial contact with Chirac would … be odd. If it looks as though we
have the nine votes and might persuade Russia and China not to vote, a serious
phone call would be well worth a try – if only to ease the way for co-operation in
the aftermath.”
121.  In a television interview on the evening of 10 March, President Chirac made
clear that France did not consider that the UN inspections had reached a “dead
end” and warned of the adverse consequences of unilateral US military action.
122.  Addressing the “most probable” scenario that evening, President Chirac
said that the revised resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March would
not secure the support of nine members of the Council. If, however, there was
a majority, France would “vote no”.
123.  Asked about his position, President Chirac replied that “regardless of the
circumstances”, France would vote “no” because “this evening” there were no
grounds for waging war to disarm Iraq.
124.  President Chirac also stated that if the inspectors reported that they were not
in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, war would become inevitable.
125.  In a television interview on the evening of 10 March, President Chirac argued
that a country with Iraq’s past and political structure was always dangerous, but it
422

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

was “genuinely dangerous only if it has the capabilities to commit aggression, if it
has the capabilities to attack”.37 The “problem was to make sure it no longer had
those capabilities or … that those capabilities could be controlled and destroyed”.
The inspections regime between 1991 and 1998 had destroyed more weapons than the
Gulf Conflict in 1991, and “resulted in the complete, almost complete eradication in all
likelihood … of Iraq’s nuclear programmes”. Iraq’s (Al Samoud 2) missiles with a longer
than permitted range were “being destroyed”.
126.  President Chirac acknowledged that there were “probably other weapons” but
Dr Blix had told the Security Council that if Iraq stepped up co-operation, which was
“never sufficient but which has improved”, weapons of mass destruction could be
eliminated. It was for the inspectors to advise whether they could complete their task.
If they reported that they were not in a position to guarantee Iraq’s disarmament, it
would be:
“… for the Security Council alone to decide the right thing to do. But in that case …
regrettably, the war would become inevitable. It isn’t today.”
127.  President Chirac stated that other regimes, such as North Korea, had nuclear
weapons which were “not hypothetical”, but definitely existed.
128.  President Chirac stated that the international community had unanimously chosen
the path of disarming Iraq; it had not decided the objective was to change the Iraqi
regime; and that:
“Today nothing tells us that this path is a dead end and, consequently, it must be
pursued since war is always a final resort, always an acknowledgement of failure,
always the worse solution … And we don’t consider we are at that point. That is
why we are refusing to embark on a path automatically leading to war so long as
the inspectors haven’t told us: ‘we can’t do any more’ … they are telling us the
opposite.”
129.  President Chirac argued that the “new resolution setting an ultimatum” represented
a move from a course of action involving the pursuit of inspections in order to
disarm Iraq to “a different one consisting of saying: ‘in so many days, we go to war’”.
France would not accept “that solution”.
130.  In response to a series of questions, President Chirac stated:

•	
•	

“So the first scenario which is today, this evening, the most probable, is that this
resolution won’t get a majority of nine members …”
“There will be nations who will vote ‘no’, including France … But … there won’t
be a majority. So there won’t be a veto problem.”

•	

“… the second scenario … the views of a number of people change … there
may indeed be a majority … in favour of the new resolution … If that happens,
France will vote ‘no’ … when one of the five Permanent Members … votes ‘no’,
and even if there is a majority in favour … the resolution isn’t adopted. That’s
what’s called exercising a veto.”

131.  Asked: “And, this evening, this is your position in principle?”, President Chirac
responded:
“My position is that, regardless of the circumstances, France will vote ‘no’ because
she considers this evening that there are no grounds for waging war in order to
achieve the goal we have set ourselves, ie to disarm Iraq.”
132.  Asked whether France would use its veto regardless of the position of China and
Russia, President Chirac replied that if there was a resolution authorising war, they
would adopt the same attitude as France.
133.  President Chirac stated that it was possible to have a difference of view with
the US. Principles and values should not be sacrificed because there was a crisis.
France had warned the US that it could not:
“… be a standard bearer for democracy and dialogue and not use every possible
method to avoid a war … [I]f the international community didn’t give its approval,
a dangerous precedent would be set if the United States bypassed the UN.”
134.  President Chirac added that he had told President Bush that the US had “already
won”. It was “highly probable” that “Iraq wouldn’t have provided the more active
co‑operation the inspectors demanded”, if the US and the UK had not deployed such
significant forces.
135.  President Chirac made clear that although France disagreed with military action,
it would remain an ally of the US. It would not stop US overflights. But he warned that
the consequences of war would be unpredictable. Reconstruction would be required
which could only be done through the UN. The responsibility of restoring a viable
situation in Iraq and the region could not be taken on by one country alone. France
would have a part to play.
136.  In response to a question about whether war would lead to a resurgence
of terrorism and clashes between the different communities in France, President
Chirac replied:
“It’s certain that, if there’s war, the first victors will probably be those seeking
confrontation, the clash of civilisations, cultures and religions. In my opinion, a war
of this nature can lead only to increased terrorism.”

424

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

137.  President Chirac stated:
“… it seems to me that war is something which will break up the world coalition
against terrorism … we mustn’t forget that a very great majority of the world’s
countries and peoples are against this war … France isn’t isolated … So if there
is a war there is indeed a risk of a new upsurge in terrorism.”
138.  The headline in Le Monde the following day was “Quelles que soient les
circonstances, la France votera non”.38
139.  Commenting on the interview the following day, Sir John Holmes wrote that, “Even
if only in response to a question”, President Chirac had gone “out of his way to make his
position categoric”.39 He added:
“The French calculation is presumably that this makes it as hard as possible for
the Russians and Chinese not to follow, and as easy as possible for the swing six
to abstain, as an obvious middle course between the two opposing blocs. The only
glimmer of encouragement that I can see for us is that he may have played this
card too soon, apparently ruling out any flexibility even if the text of a resolution is
amended … We may be able to use this against the French in arguing with others.
I suppose it is possible in theory that … Chirac could change to an abstention.
But this is clutching at straws, such is the limb he has deliberately put himself on.”
140.  Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry that President Chirac had prepared his remarks
and had decided at that stage that he was “fully in opposition to … the invasion of Iraq”.40
141.  Sir John thought President Chirac had been saying: “The text, as we have it at this
moment, is not one we can support and we will vote against it.”41
142.  Sir John stated, “There was genuine ambiguity” about what President Chirac had
meant: “There was scope for interpretation.”42
143.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock also told the Inquiry:
“The fact was that, although the words didn’t surprise us, the fact that Chirac said
it at that time, in that way, was politically aggressive by the French. That was
the point.”43

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Events of 11 March 2003
144.  In a press conference, Mr Blair stated that he hoped that France and Russia
would not talk about vetoes but try to find common ground.
145.  In a press conference following a meeting with Mr José Manuel Durao Barroso,
the Portuguese Prime Minister, Mr Blair set out that there had been an attempt to
unify people around a common position based on resolution 1441 to try to disarm
Iraq peacefully, but if that became impossible, the international community had to be
“prepared to take action”.44 He also said that divisions between Europe and the US
would be “very damaging” and that he was:
“… prepared to try and find common ground, but we need others to be equally willing
to do so.”
146.  In response to a question about what more could be given to find common ground
with France and Russia, Mr Blair replied:
“… if France or any other country is simply going to say we will veto, no matter what,
that is obviously a very difficult position … [E]verybody, including France and Russia,
accepts there is not full co-operation … So I hope we won’t talk about vetoes in any
set of circumstances or in all sets of circumstances, but rather we will try and find
the common ground that allows us a way through here … And what we are trying to
do in the Security Council now is to offer very, very clear ideas as to what Iraq has to
do in order to demonstrate it is prepared to disarm voluntarily.
“But let us not be under any illusion, there is no way that Iraq will make any
concession or co-operate in any way without the threat of force being there …
[M]y concern is that if countries talk about using a veto in all sets of circumstances,
the message that sends to Saddam is you are off the hook …”
MR STRAW’S MINUTE TO MR BLAIR
147.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that the UK and the US should not push the
second resolution to a vote if they could not secure nine votes and be certain
of avoiding any vetoes.
148.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK should adopt a strategy based on the
argument that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution
1441, and that the last three meetings of the Security Council “more than fulfil the
requirement” for Security Council consideration of reports of non-compliance.
149.  Mr Straw also identified the need for a “Plan B” in the event that the
Government failed to secure a majority in the Parliamentary Labour Party for
military action.

The National Archives, 11 March 2003, Press Conference: PM Blair and Portuguese PM Barroso.

426

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

150.  Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 11 March setting out his conclusion that:
“If we cannot gain nine votes and be sure of no veto, we should not push our second
resolution to a vote. The political and diplomatic consequences for the UK would
be significantly worse to have our … resolution defeated (even by just a French
veto alone) than if we camp on 1441. Kofi Annan’s comments last evening have
strengthened my already strong view on this. Getting Parliamentary approval for
UK military action will be difficult if there is no second resolution: but in my view
marginally easier by the strategy I propose.
“We also need to start working up a Plan B for our armed forces if we cannot be sure
of Commons’ approval for their inclusion in the initial invasion of Iraq.”45
151.  Mr Straw set out his reasoning in some detail, making clear that it was predicated
on a veto only by France. That was “in practice less likely than two or even three
vetoes”. The points made included:

•	
•	

•	
•	

•	

•	

45 

The “upsides of defying a veto” had been “well aired”, including that it would
“show at least we had the ‘moral majority’ with us”.
In public comments, he and Mr Blair had kept their “options open on what we
should do in the event that the resolution does not carry within the terms of
the [UN] Charter”. That had “been the correct thing to do”. “In private” they had
“speculated on what to do if we are likely to get nine votes, but be vetoed” by
one or more of the five Permanent Members (P5).
Although in earlier discussion he had “warmed to the idea” that it was worth
pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”;
the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.
The intensive debate over Iraq in the past five months had shown “how much
faith” people had in the UN as an institution; and that “far from having the ‘moral
majority’ with us … we will lose the moral high ground if we are seen to defy the
very rules and Charter of the UN on which we have lectured others and from
which the UK has disproportionately benefitted”.
The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’
– essentially what I am recommending. The key to our moral legitimacy then
was the matter never went to a vote – but everyone knew the reason for this
was that Russia would have vetoed. (Then, we had no resolution to fall back
on, just customary international law on humanitarianism; here we can fall back
on 1441.)”
The veto had been included in the UN Charter “for a purpose – to achieve
a consensus”. The UK could not “sustain an argument (politically, leave
aside legally) that a distinction can be made between a ‘reasonable’ and an
‘unreasonable’ veto”. That was “a completely subjective matter”.

Minute Straw to Prime Minister, 11 March 2003, ‘Iraq: What if We Cannot Win the Second Resolution?’

427

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

The “three recent meetings of the Council more than fulfil the requirement
for immediate consideration of reports of non-compliance. So we can say
convincingly that the process set out in 1441 is complete. If we push a second
resolution to a veto, then the last word on the Security Council record is a formal
rejection of a proposal that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity.”

152.  Mr Straw advised that it would be “more compelling in Parliament and with public
opinion to take our stand on the basis of [resolution] 1441, and the overwhelming
evidence that Iraq has not used the four months since then to co-operate ‘immediately,
unconditionally and actively’”. The UNMOVIC “clusters” document would be “a material
help in making that case”.
153.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that he interpreted Mr Annan’s “important” statement
on 10 March:
“… essentially as a gypsies’ warning not to try and then fail with a second resolution.
If the last current act of the Security Council on Iraq is 1441, we can genuinely claim
that we have met Kofi’s call for unity and for acting within (our interpretation of) the
authority of the Security Council.”
154.  There was no reference in Mr Straw’s minute to President Chirac’s remarks the
previous evening.
155.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that it would not be possible to decide what the
Parliamentary Labour Party and the House of Commons would agree until deliberations
in the Security Council had concluded. If a second resolution was agreed, it would be
“fine”, but that was “unlikely”. He added:
“I sensed yesterday that sentiment might be shifting our way; but we would need to
be very clear of the result before putting down a resolution approving military action.
We could not possibly countenance the risk of a defeat …
“But it need not be a disaster for you, the Government, and even more important for
our troops, if we cannot take an active part in the initial invasion, provided we get on
the front foot with our strategy.
“I am aware of all the difficulties of the UK standing aside from invasion operations,
not least given the level of integration of our forces with those of the US. But I
understand that the US could if necessary adjust their plan rapidly to cope without
us … [W]e could nevertheless offer them a major UK contribution to the overall
campaign. In addition to staunch political support, this would include:

•	
•	

intelligence co-operation;
use of Diego Garcia, Fairford and Cyprus, subject to the usual consultation on
targeting; and

428

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

•	

as soon as combat operations are over, full UK participation in the military and
civilian tasks, including taking responsibility for a sector and for humanitarian
and reconstruction work. We could also take the lead in the UN on securing the
… resolution to authorise the reconstruction effort and the UN role in it which the
US now agree is necessary.”

156.  Mr Straw concluded:
“We will obviously need to discuss all this, but I thought it best to put it in your mind
as event[s] could move fast. And what I propose is a great deal better than the
alternatives. When Bush graciously accepted your offer to be with him all the way,
he wanted you alive not dead!”
157.  Mr Straw’s minute was not sent to Lord Goldsmith or to Mr Geoff Hoon, the
Defence Secretary.
158.  Mr Straw’s Private Office replied separately on 11 March to a request from
Sir David Manning for advice on the implications of the argument that a French veto
would be unreasonable.46
159.  The FCO advised that there was “no recognised concept of an ‘unreasonable
veto’”; and warned that: “In describing a French veto as ‘unreasonable’ we would
therefore be inviting others to describe any future vetoes as ‘unreasonable’ too.”
That could have implications in other areas “such as the Middle East”. In addition,
“describing the veto as unreasonable would make no difference to the legal position”.
There was “no implied condition” in the UN Charter that a veto was valid “only” if it was
reasonable. There was “already pressure at the UN to abolish veto rights”. And pressure
could be expected to increase “if the argument that certain vetoes were ‘unreasonable’ –
and could therefore be ignored – gained ground”.
160.  The UK was “on record as saying that the veto should only be used with restraint
and in a manner consistent with the principles of the Charter”.
MINISTERIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS LEGAL ISSUES AND THE MILITARY PLAN
161.  Ministers discussed legal issues, including holding the response to a US
request for the use of UK bases for a few days, on 11 March.
162.  They also discussed the viability of the military plan.
163.  Mr Blair held a meeting to discuss the military plan and legal issues with Mr John
Prescott (Deputy Prime Minister), Mr Hoon, Lord Goldsmith and Admiral Sir Michael
Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)).47 Mr Straw attended part of the meeting.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Sir Andrew Turnbull (Cabinet Secretary), Mr Powell, Mr Campbell, Baroness Morgan
(Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations), Sir David Manning and
Mr Rycroft were also present.
164.  Mr Blair had already had a bilateral discussion with Lord Goldsmith on 11 March
on the legal basis for the use of military force early. That is addressed in Section 5.
165.  Mr Straw’s Private Office wrote to No.10 on 11 March, reporting that the US
was pressing for a response “as soon as possible” to the letter delivered by the US
Ambassador to London to Mr Straw on 5 March.48 That had formally requested the
British Government’s agreement to the use of RAF Fairford, Diego Garcia and, possibly,
other British bases for military operations against Iraq.
166.  The FCO advised that “under international law, the UK would be responsible
for any US action in breach of international law in which the UK knowingly assisted”.
The draft response was “premised on a decision that UNSCR [UN Security Council
resolution] 1441 and other relevant resolutions” provided “the authority for action”.
167.  A minute from Mr Desmond Bowen, the Deputy Head of OD Sec, advised Sir David
Manning that the request was to be discussed at Mr Blair’s meeting with Lord Goldsmith,
Mr Straw and Mr Hoon on 11 March.49 He understood that Mr Straw and Mr Hoon had
copies of Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March.
168.  The briefing note for Mr Blair described confirmation of the viability of the overall
military plan as the “main purpose of the meeting”.50
169.  The record of the meeting on 11 March stated that Mr Blair had started by
addressing the legal base for military action.51 He stated that Lord Goldsmith’s “advice
made it clear that a reasonable case could be made” that resolution 1441 was “capable
of reviving” the authorisation of resolution 678, “although of course a second resolution
would be preferable”.
170.  Other points recorded by Mr Rycroft included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Adm Boyce said he “would need to put a short paragraph [on the legal basis]
in his directive to members of the Armed Forces”.
That “should be cleared with the Attorney General”.
The UK would send the US a positive reply on its request to use Diego Garcia
and RAF Fairford “in a day or two, with the usual conditions attached”.
Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce advised that “once we had given our approval, the US
might give very little notice before the start of the campaign”.

Sir Andrew Turnbull asked whether a legal basis for military action was required
for civil servants, as well as for members of the Armed Forces.
Mr Hoon asked whether the Attorney General’s legal advice was ever disclosed.
Mr Blair asked for a quick study into the precedents for that.
Adm Boyce told the meeting that he was “confident that the battle plan
would work”.
Mr Blair stated that “we must concentrate on averting unintended consequences
of military action. On targeting, we must minimise the risks to civilians.”

171.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Mr Hoon had “said he would be happier with a clearer green light from the AG
[Attorney General]”.
Mr Blair had been “really irritated” when Sir Andrew Turnbull had “said he would
need something to put round the Civil Service that what they were engaged in
was legal”. Mr Blair was “clear we would do nothing that wasn’t legal”.
Lord Goldsmith had provided “a version of the arguments he had put to TB, on
the one hand, on the other, reasonable case”.
Mr Hoon had advised that the response to the “US request for the use of Diego
Garcia and [RAF] Fairford” should be that it was “not … automatic but had to go
round the system”. Mr Blair had said he “did not want to send a signal that we
would not do it”.
Mr Hoon and Mr Straw were telling Mr Blair that the US could act as early as
that weekend, and “some of our forces would have to be in before”.52

172.  Following the meeting, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary,
provided an outline of the military plan for Iraq and the need for decisions on the
development of the UK’s role to Sir David Manning.53 That is addressed in Section 6.2.
173.  Ms Short recorded that she had spoken to Mr Blair on the evening of 11 March
about the fact that DFID had not been invited to attend the meeting “on the legality of
military action”, which she understood was about “the use of UK bases by the US in war,
but the fundamental question on whether there was legal authority for military action
was presumably the same”.54 Mr Blair had said she would “see all” and that it had been
decided to defer the decision on basing. He was: “Hopeful on a second resolution.”
Lord Goldsmith had “said 1441 enough. A bit later, 1441 enough if detail available to
show SH [Saddam Hussein] had not complied.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Secretary Rumsfeld’s remarks, 11 March 2003
In a telephone call to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense, on 11 March
about the timing of military action, Mr Hoon emphasised the importance of a few extra
days to win over Chile and Mexico and the domestic politics in the UK.55
The MOD reported that Secretary Rumsfeld had said Gen Franks was looking at how
to “work around” a position in which the UK could not participate in military action
which assumed that the UK would be available for post-conflict activities. Mr Hoon had
responded that the UK would not want to be in that position and reiterated the case for
waiting a few more days.
In a subsequent press briefing, Secretary Rumsfeld said that it was unclear what the UK
role would be in the event that a decision was made to use force:
“… until we know what the resolution is, we won’t know the answer to what their role
will be …”56
Secretary Rumsfeld subsequently clarified his comments, saying he had “no doubt of
the full support of the United Kingdom for the international community’s efforts to disarm
Iraq”.57 Obtaining a second resolution was important to the UK, and the US was “working
to achieve that”. He added:
“In the event that a decision to use force is made, we have every reason to believe
that there will be a significant military contribution from the United Kingdom.”
In his memoir Mr Blair wrote that Secretary Rumsfeld had been “trying to be helpful”, but
it had not helped and “by then the military were absolutely determined, rightly, that they
would be part of the action from the outset, and took amiss any sense that we might be
in the second rank”.58
In the entry for 11 March in the edition of his diaries published in 2012, Mr Campbell wrote
that the incident was “indicative of the difficulties” of working with the US.59 Secretary
Rumsfeld’s clarification was the result of a further telephone call from Mr Hoon “making it
clear that we were with them”.

TELEPHONE DIPLOMACY, 11 MARCH 2003
174.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw met early on 11 March to take stock and agree a plan
to make telephone calls lobbying contacts for support for the UK approach.60
175.  President Putin told Mr Blair that there were grounds for believing that
Saddam Hussein understood the need for disarmament and had opted for

maximum co-operation with the inspectors. Russia could not accept a proposition
giving a green light to war.
176.  President Putin also warned of the risks of military action.
177.  Following Mr Blair’s discussion with President Putin on 7 March (see Section 3.7),
Sir Roderic Lyne, British Ambassador to Russia, had advised Mr Ricketts on 10 March
that he had been considering whether there was “anything to be done at the 11th hour
to turn the Russians on our current text”.61 He had concluded that Russia would “only
move if”:
“•	 the French moved;

•	
•	

and/or major amendments were made to the resolution;
or if the Americans had brokered a bilateral deal so heavily weighted towards
Russian interests that it outweighed the downside of splitting from the
French position.”

178.  Sir Roderic added that “the Americans have now left it too late”. President Putin
did not “want a breach with the Americans, for well known reasons; and this explains the
repeated Russian encouragement … to just go ahead and do it in a way which does not
involve Russia in approving war”.
179.  Stating that he was “deliberately over-simplifying”, Sir Roderic advised that
President Putin was not now going to “put himself out” or “take risks”, because:

•	
•	

•	
•	
•	

61 

The Americans had “not picked up Russian hints from mid-2001 onwards that
there is a price tag attached”.
The Americans “… did not cut the Russians in on the discussion. They
proclaimed the ‘axis of evil’, which worries the Russians mightily; they deployed
their forces; they then demanded acceptance of their resolution within a tight
time-frame and without a smoking gun or trigger. If the Russians buy into this,
what else are they buying into? War on N. Korea or Iran? (It’s not impossible
that the Russians could be brought to subscribe to a tougher approach to
proliferation, but they would need to be carried along stage by stage.) So the
Russians are very susceptible to the French line of argument that the Americans
are trying to drag us down a very dangerous road … and the time to make a
stand is now.”
Russia had “not been given its due reward for supporting the Americans on
various issues, or for not opposing them on others”.
Russia wanted freedom to act on Chechnya.
Russian domestic opinion thought France and Germany were right to stand firm
against the US.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

180.  In Sir Roderic’s view, the “only way we are now likely to get them [the Russians]
on board would be to drop the authorisation for war”. The Russians were “convinced that
the Americans are going to attack, come what may”.
181.  Sir David Manning put the email to Mr Blair on 11 March, commenting: “Good Rod
Lyne analysis on Putin/Iraq.”62
182.  Mr Blair spoke to President Putin who was ready to look for a way forward but
made it clear that Russia could not accept any proposition which looked like a “green
light for war”.63
183.  President Putin told Mr Blair that, following the visit to Baghdad by the Speaker of
the Russian Parliament, there were grounds to believe that Saddam Hussein understood
the necessity for disarmament, and had opted for the maximum co-operation with the
UN inspectors.
184.  President Putin also said that the Iraqis had been robust and confident and were
prepared to resist the Coalition; and that an initial military action might be over quickly
but Iraq was a big country and guerrilla warfare could continue for some time.
185.  Mr José Maria Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, told Mr Blair that he would
not favour putting the resolution to a vote without a guarantee of success.
186.  In a conversation with Mr Aznar, Mr Blair argued that the Spanish proposal for
a simple resolution needed to be combined with tests for Saddam Hussein.64
187.  Mr Aznar identified a number of concerns about the risks with the approach, but he
agreed to try. He was also reported to have said that without a guaranteed win, he would
not favour putting the resolution to a vote.
188.  Mr Blair also spoke to:

•	
•	
•	

President Musharraf,65
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister,66 and
Mr Göran Persson, the Swedish Prime Minister,67

to seek support for his approach.
189.  Mr Blair warned Mr Annan that the US timeframe was “days not weeks” and it
was in “no mood to negotiate further”.

190.  Mr Blair sought Mr Annan’s support for the proposals he was discussing with Chile,
and through them Mexico, to construct “clear and specific tests that would allow us to
assess whether Saddam was going to come fully into compliance and had genuinely
changed his mind”.68
191.  Mr Blair stated that the tests would be tough but achievable and the timeframe
could be short: “The US were only prepared to accept a timeframe of days not weeks.
If Saddam did demonstrate his seriousness by complying with the tests then a full work
programme would ensue.”
192.  Mr Blair added that President Chirac’s comments “that he would veto a second
resolution in any circumstances would cause a real difficulty if they were proved true.
If the UN could not reach an agreement and military action took place the UN would
be seriously weakened.” It would be hard to achieve a compromise and the US “were
in no mood to negotiate further”.
193.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that, if Iraq delivered, the UK and US “might
have to take ‘yes’ for an answer”, and that he was reviewing whether to push for
a vote if it would be unsuccessful.
194.  Secretary Powell expressed concern about the perceived shift in the UK’s
position given Mr Blair’s assurances that the UK would proceed if there were nine
votes for a resolution but a French veto.
195.  In the first of six conversations with Secretary Powell on 11 March, Mr Straw said
that he had sent him the latest version of the UK’s six tests, and that Mr Blair thought
there was a chance it would secure votes.69 He and Mr Blair would be making a series
of phone calls making the point that: “We’ve moved twice and won’t move again.”
196.  Secretary Powell was reported to have said that Ms Ana Palacio, the Spanish
Foreign Minister, “was concerned that the Iraqis could do something with the tests: they
could, for example, produce 30 scientists”. Mr Straw responded that if Iraq delivered
“we might have to take ‘yes’ for an answer”. Secretary Powell said that “was easier for …
[Mr Straw] to say than for him to accept”.
197.  Mr Straw said Mr Blair’s plan was to get President Lagos “in the bag then get him
to sell the latest draft to Fox”.
198.  Raising the question of pushing for a vote “if we knew that would not get a result”,
Mr Straw warned Secretary Powell that he was “increasingly of the view that … would
not be in the interests of international solidarity and respect for the UN”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

199.  Secretary Powell responded that that would be “a brand new element”: Mr Blair
had “always said that if we had nine votes but a French veto he could work with it”.
200.  Mr Straw reminded Secretary Powell of their conversation the previous day, adding
that “he was not at all sure that here would be only one veto: two vetoes would be
heavy; it was better not to vote”. Mr Blair had not yet made up his mind, but his “concern
was which course of action would be easier to get through the House of Commons:
no resolution because of a veto, or no resolution because of an expected veto”.
201.  President Lagos told Mr Blair he needed more time to think about
the proposals.
202.  In the first of three conversations on 11 March, President Lagos confirmed that
Mr Blair’s proposed approach could work but he wanted more time and was still thinking
about the precise terms.70 Mr Blair emphasised US concerns about delay and the risk
of an unworkable compromise. They agreed to talk again later that day.
203.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair had made clear that the proposal
was the UK’s “bottom line”, and there was little flexibility in timing.
204.  Ms Palacio expressed scepticism about any French suggestion that with
more time it could be supportive.
205.  In a conference call with Secretary Powell and Ms Palacio, Mr Straw reported that
Mr Blair thought President Lagos had “bought the language on tests” in the proposed
“Side statement”, but “might try to share the language with President Chirac”.71
Mr Blair had made clear that the proposal “was our bottom line and also that there
was no flexibility on timing of the deadline (beyond 24 hours or so)”. Neither Mr Blair
nor Mr Straw expected any Chilean approach to France “to bring acceptable results”.
Secretary Powell and Ms Palacio had agreed.
206.  Ms Palacio was reported to have said that France had been working on the
assumption that nine votes would not be achieved. If that looked closer, the French
would “change tack and instead play for time they knew the UK, US and Spain didn’t
have”. Chile was convinced it “could bridge the gap” and was “likely to come back …
with a French offer”. France would probably try to persuade Chile (and Mexico) that it
“might be able to sign up to our approach, providing” there was “a little more time”. But
France had “absolutely no intention of signing up to anything we produced”. Any French
“offer” to Lagos was “highly unlikely to be anything useful”. Mr Straw and Secretary
Powell had agreed.

207.  Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that the US message to President Fox would
be that it was “not interested in another series of negotiations”.
208.  In a subsequent bilateral conversation, Secretary Powell and Mr Straw discussed
the position of Mexico and Chile.72
209.  Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that President Lagos had not yet spoken to
President Chirac. President Bush would tell President Fox that Mr Blair’s “offer was
all he was going to get”. The US was “not interested in another series of negotiations.
Any modifications would have to be made tomorrow for a vote on Thursday.”
210.  Reporting that Dr Rice was “showing some interest in ditching OP3” (the provision
that Iraq had to demonstrate it was co-operating by a defined date), Secretary Powell
stated that he had pointed out that President Chirac would “veto anything, explaining
that the simplest language was being used as a pretext for war”.
211.  The FCO asked Ambassadors in Arab countries to make clear that little time
was left to persuade Saddam Hussein to stand down.
212.  In a telegram on the afternoon of 11 March, the FCO stated:
“If the Arabs are still serious about pressing Saddam to stand aside, they need to get
going now without waiting for a second UN SCR. If they delay there may not be time
for Arab diplomacy.”73
213.  The FCO added:
“We are now approaching the end game on Iraq. A vote on the current draft Security
Council resolution is now likely this week. If this includes, as at present, a deadline
for Iraqi action, our assumption is that that is the end point for Arab efforts. If the
resolution does not pass, the window for Arab action may be very short, and might
not be explicit.”
214.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that they should not put the draft resolution
to a vote if there would be a French veto. He was considering whether the UK
strategy needed to be adapted, but had not yet agreed that with Mr Blair.
215.  Secretary Powell suggested that Mr Blair should make plain to President
Bush the UK’s problems if the second resolution failed.
216.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke again at 6.45pm to discuss the difficulties
with securing nine votes in the Security Council and the timing of military action.74

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

217.  Discussing whether it would be wise to go ahead with a vote without the support
of Mexico and Chile, and the different views within the US Administration, Mr Straw told
Secretary Powell that:
“… he was clear that if we did not have nine votes we should go nowhere near
the Security Council. Even if we did have nine votes we should not go if we knew
the French would veto. Annan had signalled yesterday his unhappiness with the
possibility of the last act of the Security Council showing it divided and fractured
… [H]e knew that some people in the [US] Administration did not give a fig for the
UN, but the US and President Bush needed the UN across a range of subjects. The
President could make a better speech about the negotiating history of 1441 and
French failure to insert a provision for a second resolution than about why we were
ignoring a Security Council veto.”
218.  Secretary Powell asked that Mr Blair should make plain to President Bush the UK’s
problems with a failed second resolution.
219.  Mr Straw said that in his opinion we would “need to adapt our strategy” and that
the “Kosovo model might be useful. In some ways our position was now stronger: in
Kosovo we had relied on customary international law, whereas here we had a string of
resolutions culminating in 1441”. Mr Straw stressed that was his opinion and had not yet
been agreed with Mr Blair.
220.  In a conversation with Mr Blair that evening, President Lagos confirmed he
was still working on a draft resolution.
221.  When Mr Blair and President Lagos spoke for a second time, President Lagos
confirmed that he was still working on a draft Mexican/Chilean resolution.75
222.  In response to a warning from Mr Blair that President Bush would not agree a
deadline “beyond 24 March”, President Lagos was reported to have commented that
he would put his preferred deadline in the draft and there could then be a negotiation.
223.  In the absence of nine votes for the resolution, Mr Straw and Secretary
Powell discussed not putting the resolution to a vote. They agreed the decision
to pull out of a vote could be explained by blaming France.
224.  Mr Straw stated that in four successive meetings of the UN, no-one had said
Iraq had fully complied. “Iraq was therefore in material breach.”
225.  When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke again at 9pm, Secretary Powell stated
that the US and UK had “just about convinced President Lagos and President Fox; their
objections were fading away.76 Mr Straw said that President Lagos “seemed to be biting”.

226.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair was “coming round to the view that
if the nine votes weren’t there, then we should not push it to a vote”. Secretary Powell
responded that President Bush was on the same wave-length.
227.  Mr Straw added that “the situation was less clear if we had nine votes but faced
a veto”. Secretary Powell suggested that his answer to the question of how to explain
pulling out of a vote in that situation would be to “blame Paris and leave”.
228.  Mr Straw agreed, stating they could:
“… point to France signing [resolution] 1441. That resolution had demanded
‘immediate’ co-operation, but here we were four months later. The resolution
had demanded ‘active’ co-operation, but Blix could not confirm that. And, in four
successive meetings at the UN, not one of the 15 … members had said that Iraq
had fully complied. Iraq was therefore in material breach.”
229.  Secretary Powell added that the US and UK “had worked hard to obtain a second
resolution, but Chirac had clearly said on 10 March that he would veto a resolution in
any circumstances”. Mr Straw said they could also point to Mr Annan’s statement.
230.  In a subsequent conversation at 10.45pm, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell
discussed the indications that Chile and Mexico were thinking about a timeline of
45 days and the remarks made earlier that day by Secretary Rumsfeld.77
231.  When Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position late on 11 March,
it was clear that President Bush was determined not to postpone the start of
military action.
232.  Mr Blair stated that President Chirac’s remarks gave “some cover” for ending
the UN route.
233.  Mr Blair spoke to President Bush late on 11 March.78
234.  They discussed Secretary Rumsfeld’s comments about the UK, the continuing
problems in securing support for the resolution and the impact of President Chirac’s
“veto threats”. Mr Blair considered that President Chirac’s remarks “gave some cover”
for ending the UN route.
235.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that, at Mr Blair’s request, he “had made one
last effort to persuade Mexico and Chile … to support the second resolution”.79 President
Fox did not give him an answer. President Lagos had “talked about giving Saddam an
additional two to three weeks”. President Bush “told him a few more weeks would make

no difference. Saddam had already had years to comply.” Asked “one last time how
he planned to vote”, President Lagos had “said no”.
236.  Mr Campbell wrote that President Bush had apologised for Secretary Rumsfeld’s
comments, describing them as “one of those attempts to be helpful that wasn’t
very helpful”.80
237.  Mr Campbell added that President Bush had described his latest telephone calls
with President Fox and President Lagos as “difficult”; that they “had to give us their
votes”; and that “we had to get this over with”. President Bush was “determined we could
not let the date slip”.
238.  The record of the conversation confirms Mr Campbell’s account.81
239.  Mr Campbell also wrote:

When Mr Blair had “said we needed to hold their feet to the fire”, President Bush
had responded that he was “waiting your instructions. If it falls apart I’m going
to make a speech to the American people saying I tried, and now Saddam has
forty-eight hours to leave the country.”
Mr Blair “still felt Chile would come round and not walk away”.
President Bush “felt seven days was too big a stretch to give them … Congress
was getting restless and all the polls were showing criticism of the UN for
inaction. ‘We just got to go.’”
Mr Blair had “said we had to do something to change the diplomatic weather and
get on the front foot but if we can’t get anything, we’re in real trouble and there is
no point in pushing the UN beyond what it will take”.
President Bush said “We know he’s not going to disarm. We already had
benchmarks.” He had told President Lagos “it was time to stand up and be
counted. I want your vote. He said no.”
Mr Blair said he would speak to President Lagos again, and that “a week’s delay
was the top end for us”. If we were “on the front foot” it would be possible to gain
altitude again.
President Bush “said these guys [Presidents Fox and Lagos] were just playing
for time. He felt maybe we stand up on Thursday [13 March] and say there could
be no new UNSCR, that it had failed in its mission …”

Mr Blair felt that there had been “a bit more give” from President Putin in their
last call; and that “the problem was that the Chiles and Mexicos were not used
to making decisions as big as these …”82

240.  Mr Campbell commented that President Bush “did not feel the need to buy more
time” and that he was “more impatient than ever”. He was “not really listening”.
241.  Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported
that Mr Richard Armitage, the US Deputy Secretary of State, told him on 11 March,
before Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, that he was “unsure whether
Chile and Mexico were moving in the right direction”.83 President Bush had spoken to
President Fox, who had “bid for a 45-day deadline”. When President Bush had “said
no way”, President Fox “had retreated, saying he would study the papers further”.
President Bush “was still trying to speak” to President Lagos.
242.  In response to a question from Mr Armitage about whether if it looked as though
there would be nine positive votes but “one or two vetoes” the UK would want to go for
a Security Council vote “or pull the resolution”, Mr Brenton had said that “would depend
crucially on calculations of how it would play in Parliament”. Mr Armitage “thought that
President Bush’s instinct would be to go for a vote, though the impact on the UK would
weigh heavily with him”.
243.  Mr Stephen Hadley, the US Deputy National Security Advisor, had been “more
direct”. President Bush’s “instinct would be to go for a vote on 12 March, or 13 March
at the latest, whatever the situation”.
244.  Mr Kurt Volker, the US National Security Council (NSC) Director for NATO
and West Europe, had separately told UK officials that President Bush had rejected
a suggestion from Mr Aznar that the resolution might be pulled; he wanted, and
had promised the American people, a vote. Mr Aznar had also proposed that those
supporting the resolution might be asked to co-sponsor it “to act as a disincentive to
France and Russia to veto”. Mr Brenton and Mr Volker “agreed co-sponsorship seemed
a bridge too far right now”.
245.  Mr Brenton reported that he had also been asked by both Mr Armitage and
Mr Hadley whether Mr Hoon’s comments to Secretary Rumsfeld meant that the UK’s
“determination to go in alongside the US was diminishing”. He had said “not”; the UK
“remained confident that we would go alongside the US” and he “assumed” that Mr Hoon
“had simply been setting out the Parliamentary realities” to Secretary Rumsfeld.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

246.  Following three conversations with Mr Blair, President Lagos remained
adamant that more time was needed and that nobody would view a deadline
of 24 March as serious.
247.  After his conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair spoke again to President
Lagos to say that one last effort was needed to get Saddam Hussein to comply:
“Ten days was adequate for him [Saddam Hussein] to make the right statements,
get the interviews going and produce the hidden anthrax.”84
248.  President Lagos was not convinced; in his view, even 24 March looked too short
a deadline, and that nobody would believe it was serious. He wanted to talk to other
Security Council members.
CONSULTATIONS IN NEW YORK
249.  After consultations on 11 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the
draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain on 7 March had “no chance of
adoption” and that avoiding providing the US “with a new basis for the use of
force” was “a major criterion for most members of the Council”. The UK now
faced “a choice between a number of hard options”.
250.  Dr Blix had questioned whether it was right to describe failure to co-operate,
and in particular to take part in interviews, as “a very serious crime”.
251.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock was given authority to circulate the UK’s “language” to
Security Council colleagues.85 A decision on whether to speak to the French would be
subject to consultation with Sir Jeremy and a conversation should take place “only at
the end of the New York day”.
252.  Reporting discussions in New York on 11 March on the draft resolution and details
of a possible “side statement”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that he had discussed the
proposed tests with Dr Blix and Dr Dimitri Perricos, the UNMOVIC Director of Planning
and Operations.86
253.  They had raised a number of questions about the tests, the timelines for assessing
Iraqi actions and who would judge compliance. Dr Blix was:

•	

“concerned” about the statement that Iraq should yield proscribed items
“immediately” for destruction, “without delay” would be “more realistic”.
In addition “he wondered whether it was right to refer to a failure to co-operate
with UNMOVIC/IAEA, and in particular to take part in interviews, as a ‘very
serious’ crime”; and

“nervous about the concept of requiring interviewees and their families to leave
Iraq, but equally recognised the dangers – in terms of undue pressure – of
letting families remain in Iraq. He seemed to realise there was little way round
this, and said he would say in the Council only that this was a dilemma.”

254.  Dr Perricos:

•	

•	
•	

•	

•	
•	
•	

“was not keen on London’s suggestion of asking for the list of all personnel
currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s WMD programmes … Iraq had
provided names and had said they were willing to provide more in particular
areas on request”. While it would be “possible to get the interviewees out of Iraq
in the timescale we envisaged, it would be difficult to interview them as well”;
“did not expect anything new to arise” from the test on anthrax;
“was nervous” that the inclusion of mobile laboratories “made the whole package
a bit too heavy for the envisaged 7-10 day timetable” and “thought little would
come of it – i.e. Iraq would present legitimate facilities”. He thought that if the
test was kept, “it should also refer to chemical facilities and to the sites that
could support such mobile facilities”;
“preferred to stick with the language” in Dr Blix’s letter to Dr Amir al-Sa’adi,
the Scientific Adviser to the Iraqi Presidency, on missile destruction, which
he “thought would cover all Volga engines” and “agreed our inclusion of
the destruction of equipment designed for the production and testing of the
Al Samoud 2”;
“wondered whether the benchmarks would lead to a strategic shift in Iraq’s
behaviour though they would certainly ‘burn’ Iraq”;
“underlined that while action in the time period proposed was possible, there
would need to be some time afterwards to assess the action taken”; and
“asked a number of pertinent questions” including: “Who would judge
compliance? Would we want to specify whether the information should go to
UNMOVIC and/or the Council? What would we do if Iraq gave straight denials?”

255.  Sir Jeremy had discussed the draft with Mr Inocencio Arias, the Spanish
Permanent Representative to the UN, who made “few comments”, and Ambassador
John Negroponte, US Permanent Representative to the UN, who was “very concerned
that the statement should not be part of the resolution”. Another US official had
commented that Washington was “intensively discussing the benchmarks ideas, but
he had heard no one in State or the NSC who favoured them”, thought that “it would
be relatively easy for the Iraqis to satisfy the tests”, and they “would not lead to the
US feeling any safer”.
256.  Sir Jeremy had also briefed Ambassador Negroponte “in general terms” on
possible fallback options. Ambassador Negroponte thought the side statement “would
not go anywhere. Mexico and Chile were asking for a lot more then we had in mind,

443

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

including on time.” He subsequently told Sir Jeremy that President Lagos had told
President Bush that “he wanted 45 days and a second Council decision”.
257.  Sir Jeremy concluded that the draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and Spain
on 7 March had “no chance … of adoption”. The UK now faced “a choice between a
number of hard options”:

•	
•	

•	
•	

A “light” resolution without the deadline for a decision on whether Iraq had failed
to take the final opportunity and no benchmarks. That would “allow each Council
member to interpret the text as they see fit” but had “considerable legal risks …
as well as appearing too obviously as cover for US military action”.
A “light” resolution accompanied by “Blix-cleared benchmarks” while saying
“we were going the last mile for peace”. But Dr Blix and Dr Perricos “did not
think the benchmarks would necessarily be strong enough to amount to a
‘strategic change’ by Iraq”. There would be a “difficult choice of what to do if
the benchmarks were met … especially if we believed … that Iraq was still not
serious about complete disarmament”.
A “light” resolution accompanied by “stronger benchmarks”. Sir Jeremy thought
that Dr Blix might regard the UK list as “unreasonable for completion in the
timescale that we envisage”. He was inclined to chose a “Blix-approved version
if (if) we can bring the US along”.
No resolution with or without national benchmarks.

258.  Sir Jeremy commented that the FCO would:
“… wish to consider the legal implications of each of these options. If we won an
adopted resolution under [the second or third] options … we would have to live with
the (improbable?) consequences of Saddam meeting the requirements, even if the
US was not in the same position.”
259.  Sir Jeremy added:
“If we do not look like winning adoption, it might be easier to make our legal case
if no resolution is put to the vote … we could presumably still argue that 1441 had
found Iraq to be in material breach and offered it a final opportunity; that it was now
objectively clear on the basis of the Blix reports and other emerging evidence, that
Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity; and that therefore the authorisation in
678 [1990] was revived.
“To the objection that we should have tested the Council we would reply (a) that a
Council decision was not needed under 1441 … and (b) that putting the text to the
vote would have been futile in the circumstances, in particular because of publicly
stated French intransigence.
“If a resolution was put to the vote and defeated, or adopted with a majority of
antagonistic EOVs [Explanations of Vote], it would seem harder (than it already

444

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

is) to assert plausibly that our intended action carried, in any sense, the implicit
authorisation of the UN on the basis of the revival doctrine.”
260.  Sir Jeremy suggested that “it was difficult to gauge, with all the fluid dynamic of
current telephone calls, where anyone might be on a new proposal”. The “middle ground
[countries]” were “constantly cross-checking with each other”. His “best judgement” was
that it would be worth trying the second and third options during informal discussions
the following afternoon. Avoiding providing the US “with a new basis for the use of force”
was a “major criterion for most members of the Council, and he would need to make
clear that the options proposed did not do that. If that revealed opposition which could
not be overcome, that would leave the fourth option “leaving our benchmarks out there
if this has better political resonance”.
261.  The open debate on Iraq in the Security Council on 11 and 12 March is addressed
later in this Section.
262.  By the end of 11 March, it was clear that Mr Blair’s efforts to persuade
President Bush to extend the deadline for military action, while he tried to secure
support from other members of the Security Council for a second resolution
determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution
1441, had almost reached the end of the road.
263.  There were also concerns that if a majority in the Council supported the
resolution, France, Russia and China might all exercise their veto.
264.  Mr Campbell wrote that on 11 March there was a “Growing sense of crisis”,
and that:
“We desperately need some change in the diplomatic weather. The best thing may in
the end be to go in without a vote because of the timings, and that once troops are
in there the mood changes. But short of that, which was risky enough, it was hard to
see how the dynamic changed.”87
265.  Mr Cook wrote that on 11 March he had asked Mr Powell to press on Mr Blair
his view that, without a second resolution, Mr Blair could not have military action.88 If
Mr Blair went “to the House with no UN resolution he may well be defeated if he persists
in going to war”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

266.  Mr Cook also wrote that Mr Straw had been “genuinely worried” when they had
discussed possible dates for the debate on Iraq. When asked if Mr Blair understood that
he could not go for military action without a second resolution, Mr Straw had replied:
“Tony is just focused on getting a second resolution. He is not thinking about what
we do if it fails.”
267.  Mr Campbell also recorded that Mr Blair had taken a telephone call on 11 March
from Mr Rupert Murdoch “who was pressing on timings, saying how News International
would support us, etc”.89 Mr Campbell and Mr Powell “felt it was prompted by
Washington, and another example of their over-crude diplomacy. Murdoch was pushing
all the Republican buttons, how the longer we waited, the harder it got.”
268.  The Government has been unable to find any records in the No.10 files of
conversations between Mr Blair and Mr Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO of News
Corporation, Mr James Murdoch, Director/CEO BSkyB, or Lord Black of Crossharbour
(Chairman of The Daily Telegraph) in early 2003.90

Events of 12 March 2003
MR STRAW’S MEETING WITH MR BLAIR
269.  When he discussed the options with Mr Straw early on 12 March, Mr Blair
decided that the UK would continue to support the US.
270.  Mr Straw agreed.
271.  In response to a question about consideration of alternative options on the eve of
conflict, Mr Straw initially told the Inquiry that he had:
“… submitted formal minutes to him [Mr Blair]. This was far too serious to make
suggestions to him. So I thought about this a very great deal. I talked to my officials
and advisers in the Foreign Office and the agencies about this. I prepared a paper
for Mr Blair. I talked to him about it.”91
272.  The Inquiry was told by a witness it agreed not to identify that, in a meeting on
12 March, with officials from No.10 present, Mr Straw had advised Mr Blair that he
had “the final opportunity to decide on a different track”.92 Mr Straw had suggested to
Mr Blair that he had a “way out and why don’t you take it”. The witness had been “struck”
by “the speed” and the “absolute insistence” of Mr Blair’s response: “he had got his
arguments all marshalled and all laid out”. The witness did not think there was a risk of
Mr Straw resigning.

273.  Officials in No.10 “decided, after careful consideration, that the meeting should not
be recorded because it didn’t change anything … it was a very personal meeting and a
very personal discussion and that in operational terms … the track … was unchanged”.93
274.  Asked specifically in the light of that evidence if he had discussed whether
Mr Blair should go ahead with committing British troops to military action when the
second resolution failed, Mr Straw told the Inquiry that his minute of 11 March “set out
for Mr Blair the different routes open to him in the event of us not getting the second
UNSCR and my judgements on those various courses of action”.94 In the meeting on
12 March, he had “made clear” to Mr Blair that he “had options other than committing
to the invasion, and that these were still open to him, should he want to take them”.
275.  The Inquiry asked Mr Blair if Mr Straw or any of his Cabinet colleagues had tried
to dissuade Mr Blair from taking military action in Iraq, and, if so, when.95
276.  In his statement Mr Blair wrote:
“It was clear following 1441 that if Saddam did not comply fully and unconditionally,
military action was likely. No-one tried to persuade me not to take this course, other
than those who publicly and openly declared themselves, like Robin Cook and
certain ministers, who later resigned over the absence of a second resolution.
“It is correct that Jack, shortly before we were due to go in, warned me of the
political perils of doing so. I was well aware of them. But for me the issue was
straightforward: we had got the US to go down the UN route and give Saddam
a final chance; he had not taken it; such co-operation as there was, was under
the duress of military action; if we backed away now, it would have disastrous
consequences for a tough stance on WMD and its proliferation; and for our strategic
relationship with the US, our key ally.”96
277.  Asked whether his position was one of advocating to Mr Blair that he should not
commit British troops to military action, Mr Straw told the Inquiry that was “probably
putting it too strongly”.97
278.  Mr Straw added that he:

•	

had “never wanted to give the false impression that when it came to it over the
weekend [of 15 to 16 March] and then the decision on 17 [March] my position
was anything [other] than thoroughly to endorse the decision we did come to,
which was in favour of military action”;

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	

was certainly aware by 12 March that there was a “clear prospect” [of military
action] and he did not “think anybody was keen on military action”;
was “anxious that we should explore all possible alternatives”; and
“owed” Mr Blair the “best and most robust advice I could give him”.

279.  Mr Straw confirmed that the anonymous witness had given “a fair summary”
of both his and Mr Blair’s positions.
280.  Mr Straw also stated:
“The interesting thing … was that from an early stage it was the Chief of the Defence
Staff who had argued very strongly that if we were going to get involved in the
military action, the Army had to be there, because they would be unhappy and
cross if they weren’t. I don’t trivialise the way it was put across … So we could have
provided facilitation and then go[ne] in afterwards … which would not have meant
standing down the troops we had in theatre and it was essentially what the Spanish
and the Italians did.”98
281.  Section 6.1 concludes that none of the key decision-takers regarded the question
of whether the Army would be unhappy if it did not participate in combat operations as
a decisive factor in the decision on 31 October 2002 to offer ground forces to the US
for planning purposes.
282.  Describing the circumstances in which he had sent the minute of 11 March,
Mr Straw wrote in his memoir, that, after his speech in the Security Council on 7 March,
he had been:
“… convinced that unless there was a last-minute change of attitude by Saddam, for
which I hoped and prayed, war was inevitable. Whether the UK would be part of the
invasion was still unclear though … it was still far from certain that we could win a
vote on war in the Commons.”99
283.  Mr Campbell recorded the concerns about the US approach which were
discussed in the meeting.
284.  Describing the discussion with Mr Straw in the edition of his diaries published
in 2012, Mr Campbell wrote that he and Mr Powell had concluded that Mr Rumsfeld’s
comments and the telephone call from Mr Murdoch on 11 March had “effectively been
a pincer movement”. The former had “forced” the UK “to come out strong” in support
of the US in the event of military action.100

285.  Mr Campbell added that:

•	
•	
•	

Mr Straw had said “we were victims of hopeless bullying and arrogant
diplomacy” and that the UK “was being driven by the US political strategy”.
Sir David Manning also thought the actions had been “a rather crude attempt to
shaft us” and had “felt we should say to the Americans they could only use our
troops after the first effort and also on humanitarian duties”.
Mr Blair “did not want to go down that route, no matter how much he agreed the
Americans were not being helpful”.

286.  In his daily conference call with the White House, Mr Campbell told the US that
it should not comment on UK politics and, in a later call he told Mr Dan Bartlett,
President Bush’s Communications Director, that the US was doing real damage.
PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 12 MARCH 2003
287.  In Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 12 March, Mr Blair focused on
efforts to secure a second resolution and the importance for the UN of being
seen to act in response to Saddam Hussein’s failure to co-operate as required
by resolution 1441 and of achieving unity in the international community.
288.  In a clear reference to President Chirac’s statement on 10 March but without
naming France, Mr Blair drew attention to the difficulties created by countries
saying that they would veto a resolution “whatever the circumstances”.
289.  Mr Blair also stated that:

•	
•	

the UK would not do anything which did not have a proper legal basis; and
it was the Government’s intention to seek a vote on a second resolution
“in a way that most upholds the authority of the UN”.

290.  Mr Rycroft sent an urgent email to Mr Powell, Sir David Manning and other No.10
officials at 11.48am, informing them that the French Ambassador to the UK (Mr Gérard
Errera) had called “on the instructions of the Elysée”.101
291.  Mr Rycroft reported that Mr Errera had told him that President Chirac’s comment
about a veto:
“… needed to be read in the context of what had been said immediately before
about two hypotheses – either our resolution gets nine votes or it doesn’t. In other
words, the Ambassador claims that it is not the case that he [President Chirac] said
that he would vote no against any resolution.”
292.  Most of the questions raised during PMQs on 12 March related to Iraq.102

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

293.  In relation to the policy the questions included:

•	

•	
•	

Mr Peter Bradley (Labour) asked Mr Blair which was the lesser evil, allowing
more time for disarmament or dividing the international community “particularly
in view of the French President’s commitment to exercise his veto”. He also
asked for an assurance that he would resist US pressure while there was a
prospect of rebuilding the international coalition under the authority of the UN.
Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, asked whether there would be
a vote in the UN and whether the US would go to war without the UK if there
was no second resolution.
Mr Barry Sheerman (Labour) asked Mr Blair to use all his efforts to tell President
Bush that we needed another UN resolution and that there was “no need for an
unseemly haste to war”.

294.  The points made by Mr Blair included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

He was doing “everything” he could “to make sure that the international
community stays united and that we achieve a second resolution”.
Although he had not complied for “many months”, there was still time for
Saddam Hussein to avert conflict.
The “worst thing that could happen” was for Saddam Hussein to defy the clearly
expressed will of the UN and for no action to follow.
It was the Government’s intention to seek a UN vote on a second resolution
“in a way that most upholds the authority of the UN”.
The UK “should not take military action unless it is in our interests to do so.
It is the British national interest that must be upheld at all times.”
In working “flat out” for a second resolution, Mr Blair said the UK was “looking
at whether we can set out a clear set of tests for Iraq … to demonstrate that it is
still in compliance – not partial compliance …”
“… not one Iraqi scientist has been interviewed outside Iraq”.
“Iraq should produce the unmanned aerial vehicles, which can spray chemical
and biological poison …”
“If we set out those conditions clearly, and back them with a will of a united UN,
we have a chance even now of averting conflict. What we must show, however,
is the determination to act if Saddam will not comply fully.”
Military action had been “delayed precisely in order to bring the international
community back round the position … set out in 1441”.
The “heart of the agreement” of the US “to take the multilateral path of the
United Nations” was that the “other partners inside the United Nations agreed
that, if Saddam did not fully comply and was in material breach, serious
consequences and actions would follow”.
It would “be a tragedy for the UN” if it failed “to meet the challenge”.

450

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

•	

Everyone accepted that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating fully with the
United Nations: “[N]ot a single person … in Europe; not a single person in the
rest of the world – believes that he is co-operating either fully or unconditionally,
and certainly not immediately.”

295.  Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked if the Attorney
General had advised that a war in Iraq would be legal in the absence of a second
resolution authorising force; Mr Richard Shepherd (Conservative) asked why a UN
resolution was required; and Mr John Randall (Conservative) asked if Mr Blair would
publish the legal advice.
296.  In response, the points made by Mr Blair included:

•	
•	
•	

As he had “said on many occasions … we … would not do anything that did not
have a proper legal basis”.
Resolution 1441 provided the legal basis and the second resolution was “highly
desirable to demonstrate the will of the international community”.
It was not the convention to publish legal advice but it was “the convention to
state clearly that we have a legal base for whatever action we take, and … we
must have such a base”.

297.  In response to a question from Mr Kennedy about whether Mr Annan had said that
action without a second resolution would breach the UN Charter, Mr Blair stated that
Mr Annan had said that it was “important that the UN comes together”. Mr Blair added
that it was:
“… complicated to get that agreement … when one nation is saying that whatever
the circumstances it will veto a resolution.”
298.  Mr Alan Howarth (Conservative) asked whether Mr Blair agreed that:

•	
•	
•	

divisions in the international community only gave “comfort and opportunity to
Saddam Hussein”;
that “a deadline receding into the summer haze was not a serious interpretation
of ‘serious consequences’” as the Security Council had unanimously agreed in
November 2002; and
given Saddam Hussein’s motive and capacity to equip terrorists with chemical
and biological weapons, there was an urgent necessity to disarm him whether
there was a second resolution or not.

299.  Mr Blair replied that Mr Howarth had set out “precisely why we need to take
action”. Leaving troops in the region “for months on an indefinite time scale, without
insisting that Saddam disarms, would send not only a message of weakness … to
Saddam, but a message of weakness throughout the world”.

451

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

300.  Mr Blair added:
“I hope that even now those countries that are saying they would use their veto no
matter what the circumstances will reconsider and realise that by doing so they put
at risk not just the disarmament of Saddam, but the unity of the United Nations.”
301.  Mr Duncan Smith also asked, in the light of Ms Short’s comments on 9 March,
whether the doctrine of Cabinet responsibility applied to the option of committing British
forces without a second resolution. Mr Blair replied: “Yes of course it does.”
302.  In response to a question from Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru), about whether the
House of Commons would have a vote on whether to commit troops, Mr Blair replied
that it was:
“… subject to the security and safety of our troops … it is right that this House has a
say on this issue. People will then be able to see the stand that we take, and people
will then have to make up their minds as to the stand that they take.”
303.  In response to a question from Mr James Gray (Conservative) asking if Mr Blair
felt he needed the support of the Parliamentary Labour Party, the House of Commons
and the country as a whole, as well as the majority support he commanded in Cabinet,
before committing the UK to war, Mr Blair replied that as well as a vote in the House of
Commons it was:
“… important that I set out, as Prime Minister, what I believe to be right in this
country’s national interest. I have tried to do that over the past few months …”
SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S PROPOSAL TO REVISE THE DRAFT RESOLUTION
OF 7 MARCH
304.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested early on the afternoon of 12 March that in the
Security Council that day the UK should:

•	
•	
•	

table a revised draft resolution explaining that the UK was “setting aside the
ultimatum concept” in operative paragraph 3 of the draft of 7 March “because
it had not attracted Council support”;
distribute the side statement with tests for Saddam Hussein, “explaining that the
text was a national position to which the UK wanted as many Council Members
as possible to adhere to maintain the pressure on Saddam”; and
state that the 17 March date was “being reviewed”.103

305.  Sir Jeremy favoured using the open debate in the Security Council later that day to
explain the UK move, adding: “At no point will I signal, in public or in private, that there is
any UK fallback from putting this new text to a vote within 24-36 hours.”

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

306.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had explained the gist of the plan to Ambassador
Negroponte who was briefing Secretary Powell for a conversation with President Bush.
SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S MEETING WITH MR ANNAN
307.  Sir Jeremy reported that Mr Annan had asked how it could be right, when
the Council had not yet reached a decision to authorise force, for some Member
States to take the right to use force into their own hands.
308.  At Mr Annan’s request, Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on him on 12 March.104
309.  Mr Annan was reported to have told Sir Jeremy that he had an idea from his
telephone calls with Mr Blair about the UK efforts to unite the Security Council around
compromise text (for a resolution), but how would France and Russia react? Sir Jeremy
explained the UK concept of a side statement and tests which Saddam Hussein could
meet “within the tight deadline we would offer (ideally 10 days)” if he “was serious about
disarming”. Council members “should be able to agree the concept we were offering as
a way out of the current impasse”.
310.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had stressed that the UK’s objective “was the
disarmament of Iraq by peaceful means if possible”. The “aim was to keep a united
Security Council at the centre of attempts to disarm Iraq”, but calls for “grace period for
Iraq” of 45 days or longer were “out of the question”. The UK would not amend the draft
resolution tabled on 7 March:
“… until it was clear that the new concept had a chance of succeeding. If the Council
was interested, we might be able to move forward in the next day or so; if not, we
would be back on the 7 March text and my instructions were to take a vote soon.”
311.  Sir Jeremy and Mr Annan had also discussed press reporting, on 11 March, of
Mr Annan’s comments, “to the effect that military action without a Council authorisation
would violate the UN Charter”. Mr Annan said that he had been:
“… misquoted: he had not been attempting an interpretation of 1441 but merely
offering, in answer to a specific question, obvious thoughts about the basic structure
of the Charter. Nevertheless the Council was seized of the Iraq problem and working
actively on it. It had not yet reached a decision to authorise force; how … could it be
right for some Member States to take the right to use force into their own hands?”
312.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “remonstrated that the Council was in paralysis:
at least one Permanent Member had threatened to veto ‘in any circumstances’. The
Council was not shouldering its responsibilities.”

12 March’.
104 

453

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

313.  Mr Annan “had agreed ruefully”, but asked what the UK would do if we failed to get
even nine votes. Sir Jeremy said:
“… we would have to consider the next steps; but we believed we had a basis for
the use of force in existing resolutions (based on the revival of the 678 authorisation
by the material breach finding in OP1 of 1441, coupled with Iraq’s manifest failure to
take the final opportunity offered to it in that resolution) … OP12 … did not in terms
require another decision. This was not an accidental oversight: it had been the basis
of the compromise that led to the adoption of the resolution.”
314.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “urged” Mr Annan “to be cautious about allowing
his name to be associated too closely with one legal view of a complicated and
difficult issue”.
315.  At Mr Annan’s suggestion, Sir Jeremy subsequently gave the UN Office of Legal
Affairs a copy of Professor Christopher Greenwood’s (Professor of International Law,
London School of Economics) memorandum to the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC)
of October 2002 and Mr Straw’s evidence to the FAC on 4 March 2003.
316.  Sir Jeremy concluded that Mr Annan had said “several times” that he “understood”
what Mr Straw and Mr Blair “were trying to do, and expressed sympathy for the tough
situation you found yourselves in”. Mr Aznar was “in a similar predicament”. The “US did
not always realise how comments intended by US politicians for US domestic audiences
seriously damaged the position of their friends in other countries”.
317.  Sir Jeremy also reported that, in a conversation with President Chirac on 12 March,
Mr Annan had “found him ‘tough but not closed’ to possible compromises”.
MR STRAW’S CONVERSATION WITH MR IGOR IVANOV
318.  Mr Straw informed Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, that the
UK was about to table a revised resolution, omitting the paragraph from the
7 March draft which contained the deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate
that it had taken the final opportunity offered in resolution 1441 to comply with
its obligations.
319.  Mr Straw telephoned Mr Ivanov to inform him that Sir Jeremy Greenstock was
about to table a “much lighter draft second resolution”, which omitted the third operative
paragraph from the draft of 7 March.105 Mr Straw explained that the UK “did not want
the last act of the UN on Iraq to be a deeply divided one”; the “imperatives” in resolution
1441 had not been met; and that neither Mr Blair nor Mr Straw “wanted military action,
nor did Powell or Bush”. The US and the UN inspectors had “agreed” the tests the
UK would propose in a side statement. The format of the tests would be for the UN
to decide.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

320.  Mr Ivanov agreed to analyse the proposals and respond.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 12 MARCH 2003
321.  Mr Blair decided not to seek to extend the deadline of 17 March. In a
telephone call with President Bush on 12 March, he proposed only that the US
and UK should continue to seek a compromise in the UN, while confirming that
he knew it would not happen. He would say publicly that France had prevented
a resolution.
322.  Mr Blair sought President Bush’s help in handling the debate in the House of
Commons planned for Tuesday 18 March, where he would face a major challenge
to win a vote supporting military action.
323.  Mr Blair wanted:

•	
•	

to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process and the
Parliamentary vote in which France or another member of the Security
Council might table a resolution that attracted support from the majority
of the Council; and
US statements on the publication of a Road Map on the MEPP and the
need for a further resolution on a post-conflict Iraq.

324.  On the afternoon of 12 March, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the latest
position and the difficulties with Chile and Mexico.106
325.  In preparation for the call, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that he needed “to decide if
you want to ask for the further week”.107 If he did, Mr Blair could “make the case for trying
over the next 24 hours to secure a UN resolution based on the Blix agreed tests with the
revised deadline of 24 March (or whatever he [President Bush] accepts)”.
326.  If Mr Blair decided not to make the case for more time or it was rejected by
President Bush, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair to set out a “fallback”:

•	
•	

He had “not given up hope of trying to secure a second resolution” and he
knew that President Bush “wanted to get out of the UN morass”, but he needed
“a further 24 hours” to see if he could “get the Chileans to put forward a
serious proposal”.
It was “important” that the US did not “publicly lose interest in the UN route”
because of concerns that an alternative resolution with a “long, e.g. 45-day,
time-line” could be put forward which “could attract 11 votes”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

He had publicly set out the “Blix-agreed tests” and “also argued that because of
President Chirac’s threat of a veto in any circumstances, it is difficult to see how
the UN can uphold 1441”.
He planned to put the issue to a vote in Parliament.

327.  Mr Rycroft suggested that Mr Blair should ask President Bush for help to win
the vote in Parliament by stating publicly that he would publish the Road Map for the
Middle East and make a commitment to further UN resolutions, establishing a UN role
in reconstruction and humanitarian issues and in running the Oil-for-Food programme
post‑conflict.
328.  In the discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair argued that the US and UK should
continue to seek a compromise in the UN and show that they were reasonable by setting
out the tests, but he knew it would not happen.108 Mr Blair would say publicly that the
French had prevented them from securing a resolution, so there would not be one.
329.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed continuing the diplomatic route until
Sunday, 16 March and then closing it down.
330.  Mr Blair said he wanted to avoid a gap between the end of the negotiating process
and the House of Commons vote planned for the following week; and to minimise the
risk of an unhelpful French initiative. He would “have to pull out all the stops to win
the vote”.
331.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed:

“Bush said his people had watched TB at PMQs and said he was brilliant. TB said
he had spoken to Lagos and the Chileans … Bush said Fox had told him he would
get back to him within an hour and then went off to hospital … TB laid it on the line
that we had to have a vote in the Commons. He said we couldn’t pull the plug on UN
negotiating because the bigger the gap between the end of the negotiation and the
Commons motion, the worse it was for us. We had to keep trying.

President Bush, 12 March’.

“Bush said when do you anticipate a vote? TB said we had pencilled in next
Tuesday. Bush: ‘Erm.’ Long pause. TB: ‘You want to go on Monday?’ Correct. TB:
‘My military have given me formal advice re the full moon.’ It’s not a problem, said
Bush … TB said he would have to check it out. There was a clear tension between
Bush wanting sooner and TB wanting later.
“Bush was clear that the French position meant no UNSCR. But we were still trying
to be reasonable. He felt that on withdrawal of the resolution he would give a speech
saying the diplomatic phase is over, issue a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam, say late
Friday, which takes us to Sunday.
“TB went over the politics here, how we were pulling out every stop. TB said the
Tories would see this as their chance to get rid of him, support us on a war motion,
but not a confidence motion.
“Bush said they would make it clear to the Tories that if they moved to get rid of TB
‘we will get rid of them’…
“The French had definitely allowed themselves to be presented as the unreasonable
ones, which was probably swinging opinion our way a bit, but it was still very
difficult. TB said it was important we still showed we were trying to be reasonable.
But he said if Bush could delay his broadcast till after our Commons vote, it would
help. Sunday, say you’ve tried, the French are being impossible, we are working
the phones. Monday, we take it to Parliament and say we must bring this to a
conclusion. Vote Tuesday. Forty-eight hours you go to their people and say war.
The best argument we had is that we don’t want our foreign policy decided by
the French, though TB was clear again that Rumsfeld’s comments had given us
a problem.
“He [Mr Blair] then started to press on the Middle East and said if Bush would
commit to publishing the Road Map, that would be a big breakthrough. We needed
a fresh UNSCR on the humanitarian situation post-conflict. Nobody doubts us on
the tough side of things, but it’s Middle East, humanitarian, democracy in Iraq, that
people want to hear about.
“TB spelled out the symbolism in the Road Map. Bush didn’t quite get it but he was
willing to do it … But TB really pressed on him and he got it in the end. Bush said
that we had to watch out for the French, that they would be worried they had got
themselves into a ridiculous position.”109
334.  Sir David Manning and Mr Campbell discussed the next steps and news
management with their counterparts in the White House.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

335.  A meeting on 15 March was proposed before the UK withdrew the draft
resolution on 17 March. The US would issue a 48-hour ultimatum to Saddam
Hussein to leave.
336.  After the conversation between President Bush and Mr Blair, Mr Campbell and
Sir David Manning each spoke to the White House.
337.  Reporting his conversation with Mr Bartlett, Mr Campbell advised that the
US would need to respond quickly with a “we’re going in” message once it was clear
that the UN process had collapsed.110 Given the potential impact on opinion in the
Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Campbell asked that the UK should be consulted about
the US message.
338.  Mr Campbell also reported a suggestion for a meeting on neutral territory on
Saturday (15 March) to “show continued efforts on the diplomatic front, and tactically,
to forestall any French ruse. The plan would be to indicate continued strategising around
the draft UNSCR.” That would “fill the void” and “would mean that any UN talks collapse
would be delayed to Monday”.
339.  Mr Campbell’s view was that the perception that Mr Blair and President Bush
were “making a ‘last push for peace’ was fine; ‘Council of War’ was less so”. He feared
it would be seen as the latter. Dr Rice would discuss the idea with Sir David Manning.
Ending the process on 14 March, with a debate in the House of Commons on 15 March,
was also a possibility.
340.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that publishing the Road Map that weekend
was “critical” for the UK; “it had huge symbolic significance in the Middle East” and in
the UK.111 “It might be worth 50 votes to the Government” which “could make all the
difference” in the Parliamentary debate.
341.  Sir David and Dr Rice discussed the UK intention to withdraw its draft resolution on
Monday, 17 March; “news management would be critical in the next four or five days”.
342.  Sir David told Dr Rice that:
“… we could fill a lot of column inches in the next 36 hours with the activity at the
UN. Jeremy Greenstock would be making great play today with our six tests …
This should get us through today, and with any luck comment and follow-up would
carry us through tomorrow. Friday might be a short day at the UN anyway. But it
would be good to publish the Road Map then.”
343.  The US proposed a meeting. Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the timings
of a US ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave, the UK Parliamentary debate and the
beginning of military action.

344.  The record of the discussion was sent to Mr Straw’s and Mr Hoon’s
Private Secretaries.
US CONCERNS ABOUT UK DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY
345.  Secretary Powell subsequently contacted Mr Straw to express concerns
about the UK’s activity in New York.
346.  Mr Straw told Sir Jeremy Greenstock not to table the UK’s revised draft
resolution, only a “non-paper” setting out “six tests”.
347.  After Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, Mr Straw spoke three times
to Secretary Powell.
348.  In their first conversation at 4.30pm, Secretary Powell asked for clarification of
Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s instructions in the light of his activity on a new resolution.
Mr Straw explained that Secretary Rumsfeld’s intervention had “complicated matters”
in the UK:
“We now had to go even further to show we were pursuing an alternative to
automatic war. Greenstock’s instructions came from himself and the Prime Minister.
He had already spoken to Ivanov and Alvear [Mrs Soledad Alvear, the Chilean
Foreign Minister] about the new draft.”112
349.  Following further discussion about the US position that the UN route was
exhausted and their concerns about the UK activity in the UN, Mr Straw told Secretary
Powell that “nonetheless it was important to go through the motions”. The chance
of success was “one per cent” but “if Jeremy succeeded we would have to go for it”.
Mr Straw added: “But there was a ninety nine per cent chance that this would simply
be for PR.”
350.  The letter reporting the conversation was sent to Sir David Manning and copied to
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, Mr Brenton, Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary
(PUS), and Mr Ricketts.
351.  The Government has been unable to find any record of the second conversation.113
352.  In a third conversation at 6pm, Secretary Powell reiterated concern about
Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s activity at the UN and the risks if people thought a real effort
was under way which was then brought to an abrupt end on 17 March.114

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

353.  Mr Straw reassured Secretary Powell that, since their first conversation, Mr Simon
McDonald, his Principal Private Secretary, had spoken to Sir Jeremy “to ask him to
push but not too hard”. In the light of Secretary Powell’s continuing concern, Mr Straw
“repeated that there was only a one percent chance of success but it gave us room to
make the case here”.
354.  Separately, Mr Straw spoke to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who was with Ambassador
Negroponte, to ask him “not formally to introduce anything this afternoon but to say that
we were consulting about the six tests which had already been made public”.
355.  Mr Brenton reported that the US Administration’s “impatience” was “growing over
the delay at the UN”, and that:

•	
•	
•	

“However much they want to help us obtain UN backing, they are equally
determined to get on with the job of tackling Saddam. Minds are increasingly
moving in the direction of abandoning the diplomatic pursuit of the ‘undecided
six’, and focusing instead on firming up a coalition of the willing.”
The latest opinion polls showed “increased impatience with the UN process, with
some 55 percent … prepared to support a war without a new UNSCR. Chirac in
particular is seen as the villain of the piece for threatening an unreasonable veto
under all circumstances.”
A White House spokesman had told the daily press conference that President
Bush “was confident that the UK would be with the US in the endeavour to
disarm Saddam from a military point of view”.115

356.  Mr Brenton had been told by senior US officials that President Bush would have
washed his hands of the Security Council long ago, but he was determined that,
whatever, “within reason”, Mr Blair needed, he should get. That included the possibility
of UN discussions continuing into the following week if necessary. It did not, however,
extend to movement on the operational timetable. He had been advised that there
was no US willingness to shift the dates to assist a process which seemed to be
going nowhere.
SECURITY COUNCIL OPEN DEBATE, 11 AND 12 MARCH 2003
357.  At the request of Malaysia, representing the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), the
Security Council held an open debate on the “situation between Iraq and Kuwait” on
11 and 12 March.116 More than 50 speakers contributed to the debate, but no member
of the Council spoke.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

358.  Mr Mohamed Aldouri, Iraqi Permanent Representative to the UN, who spoke at the
beginning and end of the debate, stated that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

The US and UK had propagated “falsehoods and untrue allegations”
about “Iraq’s compliance and implementation of the relevant Security
Council resolutions”.
Ninety-five percent of the disarmament tasks had been completed between
1991 and 1994.
Dr Blix had reported on 7 March that Iraq was “proactively co-operating”.
There were “no obstacles” to inspections, which were “serious, effective
and immediate”.
Iraq had recently unilaterally declared its missile programme and was destroying
the Al Samoud 2 missiles which UNMOVIC had deemed to be proscribed.
None of the “allegations” presented to the Council by Secretary Powell on
5 February had “proved to be true”.
The most recent “intelligence report produced by the UK” (the No.10 dossier
‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’ – see
Section 4.3), contained previously published information.
It was important for Iraq to view the “clusters” document presented on 7 March
“in order to implement” the main tasks required “as soon as possible and to
study such questions and answer them”.
Recent allegations about RPVs were unfounded. They were small experimental
aircraft which had been examined by the inspectors.

359.  In both his opening and closing statements, Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had “taken
the strategic decision” to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. In his concluding
statement, he warned that war would bring “incalculable catastrophe”, and asked for
time to provide what evidence Iraq could to the international community to prove it had
no weapons of mass destruction. He appealed to the Security Council not to “stand idly
by” in the face of the “clear, present and serious” threat to Iraq.
360.  A number of states supported the draft resolution tabled by the US, UK and Spain,
giving Iraq a deadline, including Kuwait, Australia and Japan. The majority, however,
argued that inspections should be given more time in an effort to avoid war.
PRESENTATION OF THE UK’S POSITION
361.  UK diplomatic posts were informed that the UK was “working flat out for
a second resolution”, and there was a possibility of a short extension of the
deadline of 17 March.

461

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

362.  On the evening of 12 March, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and
North Africa, sent out a personal telegram to Heads of UK Missions, informing them that:
“All efforts from the Prime Minister downwards are focused on securing at least nine
positive votes for a second SCR. To help the middle ground of the Council, we have
amended our original draft [resolution] to include an ultimatum (currently 17 March,
with a possibility of further softening) and are discussing some tests designed to
show whether Iraq is prepared to make a strategic decision to comply fully with the
Security Council’s demands.”117
363.  The telegram summarised the tests and stated:
“The hope is that these objective tests, plus a short extension of the 17 March
deadline, might deliver positive votes from Mexico and Chile. With their support,
plus positive votes from Bulgaria (certain), the three Africans (reasonably secure),
Pakistan (not so certain) we would have the nine positive votes required …
“The threat of vetoes by France, Russia and perhaps even China is real. It
remains to be seen if they will take this step if they are convinced that nine positive
votes are in the bag. But Chirac has virtually committed himself to a veto in any
circumstances, and the Russian line is firmly against any automatic recourse to
force. The final denouement in New York will be before the end of the week …”
364.  The telegram stated that decisions on UK participation in military action would
“depend on the outcome in New York and a debate and vote in the House of Commons,
likely to be on 17 March”.
365.  Heads of Mission were told that the telegram was for “background”; and that:
“… in any private conversation, even with trusted interlocutors, you should not
speculate but rest for the moment on the fact that we are working flat out for a
second resolution which reunites the Council and puts the pressure back where
it belongs, on Iraq.”
366.  Mr Chaplin added that if the resolution passed “and assuming the Iraqi regime fails
the tests set for it (there is absolutely no sign of Saddam Hussein preparing a U-turn),
we can assume military action would follow quickly after the expiry of the ultimatum”.
If the resolution did not pass, the timetable was “much more uncertain”. The Americans
would “not want to delay long”. Mr Straw had decided that the UK “would not want to
get ahead of US travel advice” which would “squeeze the time available for UK citizens
[in the region] who want to get out”.
367.  Mr Chaplin commented that Heads of Mission had been receiving “plenty of
guidance in the form of ministerial statements and reports from UKMIS New York on
Telegram 33 FCO London to Riyadh, 12 March 2003, ‘Personal for Heads of Mission: Iraq:
The Endgame’.
117

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

the negotiations” on the second resolution, but they “might like a bit more of the flavour
as we enter the end game”. Events were “moving pretty fast” and they should not be
“surprised” if the guidance was “a little out of date by the time you read it”.
CONSULTATIONS ON UK PROPOSALS TO IDENTIFY KEY TESTS FOR IRAQ
368.  As agreed by Mr Blair and Mr Straw, the UK’s draft tests were circulated in
a meeting of Security Council members late on 12 March where they attracted a
mixed response. It was recognised that the UK was making “a real effort” to find
a way forward; but there was “no breakthrough”.
369.  France, Germany and Russia focused on UNMOVIC’s identification of key
disarmament tasks and a work programme, as required by resolution 1284 (1999).
370.  Dr Blix said UNMOVIC would be seeking comments on its proposals on
14 March.
371.  The UK circulated its draft side statement setting out the six tests to a meeting of
Security Council members in New York on the evening of 12 March.118 The draft omitted
an identified date for a deadline and included the addition of a final clause stating that:
“The United Kingdom reserves its position if Iraq fails to take the steps required of it.”
372.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Council members that the UK “non-paper”, setting
out six tasks to be achieved in a 10-day timeline, responded to an approach from the
undecided six (U-6) looking for a way forward.119
373.  Sir Jeremy said he had consulted Dr Blix and Dr Perricos, but the list was the
responsibility of the UK, which was:
“… anxious to preserve the possibility of a peaceful solution and had been
distressed by the failure of the Security Council to find a formula around which the
Council could group without vetoes.
“I was asking all Council members without exception if this was an opportunity we
could take. If there was traction we would be willing to consider dropping OP3 of our
draft resolution. But if the Council did not see this as a way through, the co-sponsors
would stick with the current draft and the package was null and void.
“There was a placeholder in the non-paper for a date – 17 March remained and
I had no other date to offer. But clearly 17 March was approaching fast and was
not consistent with a 10 day timeline for the tests if the idea was taken up. The
discussion of dates would have to be set against the realities – there was no great
scope for moving to the right.

463

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“I suggested a further session the following day to get more considered reactions.”
374.  Sir Jeremy reported that the points made by the representatives of the other
Permanent Members of the Council were:

•	

•	
•	
•	

Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, said that
“Russia had not changed its position: they could not accept automaticity
or ultimata” and the “10-day deadline was too short”. He “questioned how
the UK’s tasks” related to the “key remaining disarmament tasks and the
work programme” required by resolution 1284 which would be issued the
following week.
Ambassador Negroponte “said it was clear the UK was going the extra mile
to find a basis for an agreed approach. The proposal should be seriously
considered especially if it strengthened the prospects for Council unity.”
Mr Wang Yingfan, Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN, “felt confused”.
Would the UK approach “wipe the slate – and material breach – clean for Iraq?”
He “doubted the timeline was feasible”.
Mr Jean-Marc de La Sablière, French Permanent Representative to the
UN, “said France had always been interested in an approach based on
benchmarks – but this had to be in the context of the work programme and
key remaining tasks” required by resolution 1284. “Benchmarks also had
to be completely separate from any ultimatum.” He “thought we could have
disarmament in a limited time without inspections” but “the UK approach did
not allow” Council unity to be preserved.

375.  Points raised by the representatives of other members of the Council included:

•	

•	

•	

Mr Gunter Pleuger, German Permanent Representative to the UN, “pleaded for
time to discuss the proposal in detail”, and asked about the status of the paper,
what would be the purpose of the draft resolution without OP3 and whether it
“made sense to set some tasks now when the 1284 key remaining tasks would
be issued soon and subsume them”.
Mr Aguilar Zinser, Mexican Permanent Representative to the UN, was
“effusive” about the initiative. He said that the Council “would have to devote
time to studying the proposal”. He questioned the “relationship with the 1284
tasks; the timeframe … proposed; the role of UNMOVIC and IAEA in verifying
compliance; whether the tests would be collectively assessed; the connection
with the resolution; and whether the use of force would be conditioned”. He had
been asked to set out his Government’s reservations. “They still did not see a
way out of the difficulties in the Council nor elements allowing consensus and
understanding. They still did not have a final position on the draft resolution.”
Mr Mamady Traoré, Guinean Permanent Representative to the UN and
President of the Council, was “happy” that the UK “had made this attempt to
reach consensus”.

Mr Mikhail Wehbe, Syrian Permanent Representative to the UN, said the UK’s
“non-paper made matters even worse as it included warnings over and above
those in 1441 as well as multiple ultimata”.
Mr Stefan Tafrov, Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the UN, “felt this was
a genuine effort at consensus that would need some time to digest”.
Mr Martin Belinga Eboutou, Cameroonian Permanent Representative to the UN,
“thought this might open a path to bringing forward the different viewpoints”.
Mr Munir Akram, Pakistani Permanent Representative to the UN, asked “a host
of questions” and said “he had always envisaged a ‘credibility test’ that would
show peaceful disarmament was possible”; but Pakistan had seen that as the
“first instalment and as deriving from the 1284 key tasks”.
Mr Ismael Gaspar Martins, Angolan Permanent Representative to the UN,
“saw value in the paper and liked the idea of disarmament in instalments”.
Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN,
“welcomed this effort addressing the concerns many had recently expressed”.
He would divulge his country’s views the following day.
Mr Arias said the approach “was a positive way of achieving consensus”.
He “supported the concept and content”.

376.  Dr Blix said UNMOVIC would be sending its draft of the key tasks required by
resolution 1284 to the College of Commissioners that evening for comment by 14 March.
The tasks would be ready the following week. It was for the Council to decide whether
it agreed with the tasks selected.
377.  Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had:
“… said there had been recent discussion of how to continue exerting pressure, of
which military pressure was the most important element. There was the concept of
a “strategic decision” by Iraq …
“He understood the UK was asking for a commitment from Iraq along with a downpayment. While they might not be formulated identically, all the questions raised
by the UK figured in the key remaining disarmament tasks … The statement by
Saddam Hussein was none of UNMOVIC’s business while interviews outside Iraq
was an element of the work programme. Progress on missiles could be speeded up.
“How far Iraq would be able to do the rest, he did not know. UNMOVIC’s judgement
was that these tasks were doable. This was not possible in two days. As for 10 days,
he did not think he could guarantee Iraq would do it but UNMOVIC would report on
what had been done in the time set by the Council but not offering a judgement.
“As we reached the end of the period, there might be another batch of
tests so to continue and renew the pressure on Iraq to deliver the fastest
disarmament possible.”

465

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

378.  Sir Jeremy stated that the Council “had to be clear that the ship of the Security
Council was heading for an iceberg”. The UK’s proposal:
“… was a repair job … The whole point was to avoid military action. We could not
go blindly on with 1284 without the crucial missing ingredient – Iraq’s full and
willing co‑operation.”
379.  Addressing specific questions that had been raised, the points made by
Sir Jeremy included:

•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	

“The UK would take yes for an answer if the tests were completed in their
totality. The tests were not impossible and would make it blindingly obvious if
Iraq had taken a strategic decision to disarm …”
“[W]e might not have to vote as early as 14 March if there was traction … If there
was no traction we would likely vote on 14 March on the current text.”
“The co-sponsors … had agreed on the package and wanted to see the
Council’s response.”
“[T]he more people who joined us the more the judgement of compliance would
be a collective one. We valued the judgement of the inspectors, but it was for
the members who signed up to the statement … to assess whether the tests
had been satisfied. 1441 did not specify who would make the judgement on
compliance – that was one of its ambiguities – but if the tests were collective,
the UK had no problem with the judgement being collective”.
“[W]ithout OP3 our resolution would not be an ultimatum …”
“[I]f there was traction on this idea, the UK would be committed to getting
maximum time. But it was not possible at this stage to give a firm date and the
flexibility for extra time was very limited …”

380.  France, Germany and Russia had all responded that the draft resolution, “even
without OP3”, would still authorise force. Sir Jeremy replied that:
“… without OP3, the resolution would be a restatement of resolution 1441 …
There was no way out of the dilemma … unless we delivered Iraqi co-operation.
We were trying to offer a means of doing that. We had to rally, not to camp on
national positions.”
381.  Sir Jeremy commented that the initiative had resulted in:
“•	 genuine expressions of warmth from the U-6 for taking them seriously;

•	
•	
•	

recognition that the UK had made a real effort to find a way through for
the Council;
discomfiture of the negative forces, who sounded plaintive and inflexible in
their questioning;
reasonable support from Blix, who did more than not disown us (though he
could have been more helpful on the timeline); and
466

•	

finally, a bit of time. I can keep this going at least until the weekend.”

But:

•	
•	

the UK had not achieved “any kind of breakthrough. The French, Germans
and Russians will undoubtedly home in on the preambular section of the draft
resolution and on the whiff of ultimatum in the side statement”; and
there were “serious questions about the available time”, which the US would
“not help us to satisfy”.

382.  Sir Jeremy concluded that informal consultations would resume the following
afternoon. He did “not think he needed detailed instructions if we continue down this
track for a further day or two, but grateful for comments and telling arguments on where
we have reached so far”.
FRENCH CONCERNS ABOUT THE UK PRESENTATION OF PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S
REMARKS
383.  France registered its concerns about the way in which the UK Government
was describing President Chirac’s comment about a veto.
384.  In addition to his conversation with Mr Rycroft that morning (described earlier in
this Section), Mr Errera called on Mr Ricketts on the evening of 12 March for “a private
talk on where things stood” between the UK and France on Iraq.120
385.  Mr Ricketts reported to Sir John Holmes that Mr Errera had remonstrated “about
how British Ministers had misconstrued President Chirac’s comments”, and that he
[Ricketts] had responded by pointing out the prominence of the quote on the front page
of Le Monde. He and Mr Errera had:
“… agreed fairly quickly that the immediate crisis would play out with France and the
UK on different positions, and that the more productive thing was to look ahead, and
consider what lessons we should learn from recent events …”
386.  Mr Errera had assumed “that the UK would not want to go through again what we
had been put through in recent weeks by the Americans”; “nor would it be so easy for
the UK to claim that our policy of close alliance gave us real traction over US policy”.
387.  Mr Ricketts responded that Iraq had shown up:
“… very starkly a difference of threat perception, with the UK, Spain, Italy and some
others … genuinely believing that the threat of WMD in the hands of a regime like
Iraq, in a world inhabited by the likes of Al Qaida, was a worse prospect than the
risks of military action to deal with it … Ministers were genuinely convinced of the
rightness of the policy, it was not poodleism …”

120 

Letter Ricketts to Holmes, 13 March 2003, ‘France and Iraq’.

467

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

388.  In response to Mr Ricketts’ attempt to focus on issues after the conflict and wider
US/European relations, Mr Errera stated that “the Americans were determined to divide
and rule”; and that they expected “unquestioning support for whatever was their policy
objective of the moment”.
389.  Mr Ricketts “disputed the model”, commenting that “a bit more modesty” in
European ambitions for a common foreign and security policy “might not be a bad thing”.
Mr Errera “did not have any new thoughts on how a different transatlantic relationship
could be constructed in the light of Iraq beyond the need to strengthen Europe”.
390.  Mr Ricketts concluded that Mr Errera was “keen to keep channels open despite
the difficulties”; and that he had given the same message.
391.  A copy of the letter from Mr Ricketts was sent to Sir David Manning.
JIC ASSESSMENT, 12 MARCH 2003
392.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) continued to warn in March that the
threat from Al Qaida would increase at the onset of military action against Iraq.
393.  The JIC also warned that:

•	
•	

Al Qaida activity in northern Iraq continued; and
Al Qaida might have established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated
during a US occupation.

394.  On 12 March, the JIC produced a further update on the implications for
international terrorism of military action in Iraq.121
395.  In its Key Judgements, the JIC stated:
“•	 The threat from Al Qaida will increase at the onset of military action against Iraq.
Attack plans in the time-frame of a potential conflict are probably now going
ahead under the control of lower-level operational leaders, but Khalid Sheikh
Muhammad’s capture may lead to postponement or abandonment of at least
some terrorist plans.

•	
•	

121 

The greatest threat to Western interests from Islamist terrorists is in the Middle
East. South-East Asia and East Africa are the most likely regions for attack
outside the Middle East, although Al Qaida retains a strong determination to
mount attacks in the US and UK.
Al Qaida and sympathisers may well attempt chemical or biological terrorist
attacks in the Gulf, including against UK civilian targets there, in the event of
war with Iraq.

•	
•	

Al Qaida terrorists in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) previously noted
testing and producing chemical and biological substances remain active and
are likely to attack Coalition forces.
Senior Al Qaida associated terrorists may have established sleeper cells in Iraq,
to be activated during a Coalition occupation.
Iraq continues to prepare for terrorist attacks against Western interests in the
Middle East, Europe, South-East Asia and elsewhere, although the regime’s
capability remains limited, especially beyond the Middle East.”

396.  Other key elements from the Assessment are set out in the Box below.

JIC Assessment, 12 March 2003:
‘International Terrorism: War with Iraq: Update’
Islamist terrorists

•	

There was “a substantial body of reporting of plans by Al Qaida and other Islamist
terrorists for attacks in the Middle East”.

•	

“Arrests of extremists involved in chemical/biological (CB) attack plans in Bahrain
may have reduced the threat of an attack there linked to conflict with Iraq. But the
full distribution of instructions for making CB devices has yet to be uncovered […]”

•	

“A substantial body of reporting (much of which is also uncorroborated) suggests
targeting against UK and US interests.”

•	

Al Qaida retained “a strong determination to mount attacks in both countries”.

Islamist terrorists in Iraq

•	

Reporting since 10 February had suggested that the senior Al Qaida associate,
Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, had “established sleeper cells in Baghdad, to be activated
during a US occupation of the city”.

•	

It was “possible” that the sleeper cells had “received CB materials from terrorists
in the KAZ”.

•	

“Whatever the precise relationship between al-Zarqawi and his DGI [Directorate of
General Intelligence] contacts”, it was “unlikely that he could conduct activities in
Iraq without the knowledge (and probably the support) of the regime”.

Conclusion

•	

“Despite serious setbacks for Al Qaida, and some disruption of terrorist activity,
especially in the Middle East, the threat from Islamist terrorism in the event of
war with Iraq remains high, with continuing evidence of attack planning. We can
expect Al Qaida to persist with plans for at least one major attack to coincide with
an outbreak of hostilities, as well as widespread attempts at low-level attacks by
extremist groups and individuals worldwide, especially in the Middle East, Africa
and South-East Asia.”

•	

The JIC judged that the threat from Al Qaida remained “greater than any terrorist
threat from Iraq”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Events of 13 March 2003
397.  Mr Blair saw both Mr Cook and Ms Short before Cabinet on 13 March to
discuss their concerns.
398.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that, in the context of preparations for meetings
with Mr Cook and Ms Short:
“JP [John Prescott] emphasised how important it was to make clear today was
not the final Cabinet before any action, that there would be another one if the UN
process collapsed. The political argument that we needed now was that the French
had made it more not less likely that there would be conflict. This was the way some
of our MPs could come back … Jack [Straw] agreed to go out and do clips [for the
media] on the French.”122
399.  Mr Cook wrote in his memoir that he told Mr Blair before Cabinet on 13 March that
his mind was made up (to resign if the UK went ahead without a second resolution), but
he would not make a public move while Blair was “still working for a result at the UN”.123
400.  Mr Cook wrote that his impression was that Mr Blair was “mystified as to quite how
he had got into such a hole and baffled as to whether there was any way out other than
persisting in the strategy that has created his present difficulties”.
401.  In relation to press reports that Mr Blair had told Mr Duncan Smith that he now
thought a second resolution “very unlikely”, Mr Cook also wrote:
“Since the fiction that Tony still hopes to get a second resolution is central to his
strategy for keeping the Labour Party in check, it is not welcome news that IDS has
told the world that not even Tony believes this.”
402.  Following Ms Short’s interview with the BBC’s Westminster Hour on 9 March,
Mr Chakrabarti had written to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 11 March to explain Ms Short’s
position.124
403.  Mr Chakrabarti described Ms Short’s concerns as:

•	

The process of trying to obtain the second resolution “prior to military action
should be fair and transparent”. “That would include no undue pressure on the
smaller SC members; allowing enough time (perhaps until the end of March)
after voting on a new resolution for the process of an ultimatum to run its course;
an objective judgment about whether Iraq had complied with any ultimatum

(which the proposed tests would help with); and a clear legal opinion about the
circumstances under which military action without a further resolution could meet
the UK Government’s commitment to respect international law.”
“Early and public agreement with the USA on a UN SC mandate for the civil
administration and reconstruction of Iraq”, which would “almost certainly require”
Mr Blair’s personal involvement with President Bush. DFID understood that
“it would be illegal for us, the UN and many other donors to get involved in the
reform of Iraqi institutions and reconstruction of the country (beyond what is
needed for the delivery of immediate humanitarian assistance under our Hague
and Geneva Convention obligations) without a further … UNSC mandate.
The absence of agreement with the US on this is holding up international
planning and the prospects of burden sharing.”
It would be “highly desirable” for Mr Blair to meet Mr Annan “soon and more
often”. That “would send a clearer signal of the certainty we attach to the
UN role”.
The Quartet Road Map “should be published before any military action”.
Ms Short felt “strongly that now is the time” for Mr Blair to get President Bush
to “sign up” to publication. Progress would “reduce the hostility to the West and
tensions in the Arab world which our actions in Iraq risk provoking”.

404.  In relation to the need for a legal opinion, Mr Chakrabarti added:
“I know DFID is not alone in wanting to see written advice from the Attorney General
and/or Ministerial discussion about the legality of military action without the second
UNSCR. It would be strongly desirable for the legal opinion, to cover the range of
possible voting outcomes, to be put to Ministers before the end of the week. If that
legal opinion gave backing to US/UK military intervention in the absence of a second
resolution, Clare believes the Government would still need a discussion on the
political merits of taking that course of action.”
405.  Mr Chakrabarti suggested that the Government’s communications strategy might
“make clearer the UK’s concerns for the Iraqi people and the centrality of the UN in
resolving the crisis, including through a strong role for the UN after any conflict”.
406.  Mr Chakrabarti also suggested that “more frequent and systematic discussion of
these issues between senior ministers would be helpful”. He understood that Mr Blair
might ask senior ministers to meet more regularly if conflict started, but advised starting
sooner, “given the scale and significance of the decisions being taken”. In addition,
Mr Blair and Ms Short needed “to talk more often, probably on a daily basis until
negotiations on the second resolution are concluded”. “Most of her concerns” were
“agreed government policy”, but she needed to be reassured that they would be “taken
fully into account”.

471

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

407.  In her memoir, Ms Short wrote that when she arrived in her office on 11 March,
Mr Chakrabarti and senior officials had “obviously been instructed by No.10 to try to
get me in line”.125 They had also “been asked to find out what it would take to make
me stay”. After discussion, they agreed that the conditions were:
“1.	 Publish Road Map [for the Middle East]
2.	 Absolute requirement UN mandate for reconstruction
3.	 UN mandate for military action.”
408.  Ms Short added that her diary also recorded:
“Briefing from No.10 I had not raised these issues before. Shocking! Raised at every
Cabinet and at a series of private meetings with TB.”
409.  Mr Blair told Ms Short that President Bush had “promised a UN mandate for
reconstruction” and that her position on the Road Map might help him with President
Bush. In response to a request from Ms Short that he should “try a process at UN
that treats UN with respect not just forcing US timelines”, Mr Blair “said he could get
more time”.
CABINET, 13 MARCH 2003
410.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain
a second resolution and, following the French decision to veto, the outcome
remained open.
411.  Mr Blair indicated that difficult decisions might be required and promised
a further meeting at which Lord Goldsmith would be present.
412.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that Iraq continued to be in material breach of
resolution 1441 and set out his view of the legal position.
413.  Mr Straw told Cabinet that there was “good progress” in gaining support in
the Security Council and described President Chirac’s position as “irresponsible”.
414.  The position presented to Cabinet by Mr Blair and Mr Straw did not
acknowledge the reservations expressed by the non-permanent members of the
Council. The limited time available for a decision, dictated by US decisions on
the military timetable, meant that it would be very difficult to secure nine votes
in support of the UK proposals.
415.  Nor did Mr Blair and Mr Straw acknowledge the concern that, if there were
nine votes in support of the resolution, China and Russia, as well as France, might
exercise their vetoes.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

416.  Cabinet was not informed of the strategy Mr Blair had agreed with President
Bush to manage the issue until 17 March.
417.  There was no discussion of the options available to the UK if the attempt to
secure a second resolution failed.
418.  Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Ms Short, whose
responsibilities were directly engaged, had not seen Lord Goldsmith’s legal
advice of 7 March.
419.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 March that work continued in the UN to obtain a second
resolution.126 The UK had presented proposals for six “tests”, “endorsed by Dr Blix”,
to judge whether Saddam Hussein had decided to commit himself to disarmament.
Satisfying those tests would not mean that disarmament was complete, but that the
first steps had been taken. The non-permanent members of the Security Council
were uncomfortable with a situation where “following the French decision to veto”, the
Permanent Members were “not shouldering their responsibilities properly”. The “outcome
in the Security Council remained open”. If the United Nations process broke down,
difficult decisions would be required and there would be another Cabinet meeting at
which the Attorney General would be present.
420.  Mr Blair also stated that the MEPP needed to be “revived”; and that “the
reconstruction of Iraq after a conflict would need a United Nations Security Council
resolution”. The US had “now agreed” to that, which would “help to bring countries with
divergent views on military action back together again”.
421.  Mr Straw said that although there were differences between members of the
Security Council, “none was saying that Iraq was complying with its international
obligations”; and that it “followed that Iraq continued to be in material breach” of
those obligations.
422.  On the legal basis for military action, Mr Straw said that he “was already on
record setting out the position to the Foreign Affairs Committee” on 4 March. Mr Straw
rehearsed the negotiating history of resolution 1441 (2002), stating that:

•	
•	
•	

126 

“the French and Russians had wanted a definition of what would constitute
a material breach, but had settled for the facts being presented to the
Security Council”;
“they had also wanted a statement that explicit authorisation was required for
military action and instead had settled for further consideration by the Security
Council …”; and
failure by Iraq to comply with resolution 1441 “revived the authorisations
existing” in resolutions 678 (1990) and 687 (1991).

Cabinet Conclusions, 13 March 2003.

473

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

423.  Mr Straw noted that the Government’s supporters had “a clear preference” for a
second resolution but that “had not been seen as an absolute necessity”. There had
been “good progress” in New York in “gaining the support of uncertain non-permanent
members of the Security Council, including Mexico and Chile”.
424.  Mr Straw described Mr Chirac’s public assertion that “France would veto in any
circumstances” as “utterly irresponsible”; and that Mr Annan was “equally unhappy”
with that development.
425.  Mr Straw’s sense was that there was “growing understanding for the Government’s
case” in the House of Commons.
426.  In the discussion, the points made included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the integrity of the UN process should be respected and enough time allowed for
Saddam Hussein to meet the tests;
the French veto was significant because “it implied that France would never be
prepared to use force”; its approach “amounted to dismissing the evidence and
insisting on indefinite delay”. The French position had “undermined the unity”
of the Security Council;
a majority of the members of the European Union supported the UK line;
a “balance had to be struck between striving” for a second resolution and “being
prepared to do without it if that was the outcome of negotiations”. It would be
“easier” to make the “political, moral and legal case” if such a resolution could
be achieved;
although the rhetoric used by the US leadership was “sometimes unpopular”,
that “did not mean that their policy was wrong”. President Bush had made more
use of the UN than his predecessor and he had publicly committed the US to
a two-state solution in the Middle East;
the “atmosphere in the Middle East and more generally would be transformed
for the better” if the United States could be persuaded to publish the Road Map
for the MEPP; and
UN authority for the reconstruction of Iraq was “essential so that all countries
and international institutions could contribute”.

427.  Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that there had been welcome progress
in the Middle East with the appointment of a Palestinian Prime Minister. That called for
a positive response by the US. The French position “looked to be based on a calculation
of strategic benefit”. It was “in contradiction of the Security Council’s earlier view that
military action would follow if Iraq did not fully and unconditionally co-operate with the
inspectors”. The UK would “continue to show flexibility” in its efforts to achieve a second
resolution and, “if France could be shown to be intransigent, the mood of the Security
Council could change towards support for the British draft”.

474

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

428.  Cabinet: “Took note.”
429.  Mr Cook wrote in his memoir:
“When we began, Gordon launched a long and passionate statement of support
for Tony’s strategy. The contribution was rather marred by an outspoken attack
on France: ‘the message that must go out from this Cabinet is that we pin the
blame on France for its isolated refusal to agree in the Security Council’.”127
430.  Mr Cook added that he had reminded colleagues that “when this is over, the first
priority must be to repair the divisions in Europe” and that the Government should
not make that job more difficult by sending out messages that attack France or any
other European country”. He had “applauded” the “ingenuity” of Mr Blair, Mr Straw and
Sir Jeremy Greenstock in finding new initiatives but stated that “the intensity of our
efforts to get agreement in the Security Council means that we cannot now pretend
that it does not really matter if we fail to get agreement”. Mr Cook had warned that the
Government “should avoid saying that we will take military action even if we fail to get
a resolution, as we need some flexibility to consider what we do if we find ourselves
in that position”.
431.  Ms Short wrote that she had asked for “a special Cabinet with the Attorney General
present” and that had been agreed.128 She had also said, “if we have UN mandate,
possible progress on Palestine /Israel and try with the second resolution process, it
would make a big difference”. She was “hopeful of progress”.
432.  Ms Short added:

•	
•	
•	

“GB spoke animatedly about what France was saying – no to everything.”
“Jack Straw also anti-France.”
“David Blunkett [the Home Secretary] said we must stand by the PM and Chirac
was reckless …”

433.  Ms Short had been advised by Mr Chakrabarti that she should focus her
intervention in Cabinet on the need for “a proper decision making process”, which would
be “important both in substance and … for the politics”. In his view, there were two key
points to make:

•	

127 
128 

“Cabinet needs to discuss now the legal opinion of the Attorney General and
how to make it public. This is vital for Ministers, our armed services and the
civil service.”

475

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	

“As soon as we are clear on the second resolution (whether it fails to get
the necessary votes or is not put to a vote), Cabinet should meet again
for a discussion on the politics and to put a proposition to Parliament for
immediate debate.”129

434.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that:

•	
•	

•	
•	
•	

Lord Williams of Mostyn, the Leader of the House of Lords and Attorney General
from 1999 to 2001, had “said there would be a debate [in Cabinet] on the
legality”, and Ms Short had said Lord Goldsmith should be present. Mr Blair had
“said of course he would”.
Mr Blair “said that the French had exposed fully how intransigent they were.
Chirac’s ‘whatever the circumstances’ was a mistake, and the wrong approach,
and people were angry about it. They had also now rejected the basis of the
tests we were proposing without any discussion or consideration. He felt
Chirac’s desire for a ‘bipolar world’ was leading him to turn away from discussion
of any kind on this. He promised another discussion before a vote.”
Mr Brown “came in very strongly later on, on the French in particular”.
Mr Cook “said we should not ‘burn our bridges’ with the French, made clear
that there must be a legal base for action, there was no political case without
a second resolution and we must keep working for it”.
Ms Short “said we needed the Road Map published, lambasted the ‘megaphone
diplomacy’ but as ever gave the impression that it was just us and the Americans
who engaged in it. She said the world community was split because the
Americans were rushing. We should not be attacking the French but coming up
with a different kind of process. ‘If we can get the Road Map, we can get the
world reunited behind it.’”130

435.  Mr Campbell commented that Mr Cook had spoken “very deliberately” and his
intervention was “a very clear marker” that he would resign “if there was action without a
second resolution. He felt we did not have the moral, diplomatic or humanitarian cover.”
436.  Ms Short told the Inquiry that the “strategy was: blame the French and claim that
they’d said they would veto anything. And they said it at the Cabinet …”131
437.  Sir Stephen Wall, Mr Blair’s Adviser on European Issues and Head of the Cabinet
Office European Secretariat 2000 to 2004, told the Inquiry that at Cabinet on 13 March:
“As Tony Blair came into the room John Prescott stood up and saluted. It was a
sort of funny moment but in I think in a rather characteristic way John Prescott was
doing something quite clever. He was saying ‘You are the Commander in Chief and
Minute Chakrabarti to Secretary of State [DFID], 12 March 2003, ‘Cabinet 13 March 2003: Iraq’.

this is the time to rally to the flag’. People laughed but interestingly the atmosphere
changed. Sitting at the back I had thought to myself ‘This is going to be a difficult
Cabinet’, and it wasn’t.”132
438.  Asked by the Inquiry why he had decided to continue the negotiations and whether
that was “not in particularly good faith”, Mr Blair replied:
“No. It was very simply this, that obviously this was a second best thing now … but
what we decided was … even if you can’t get the resolution because they have
said they will veto, nonetheless you would have some greater, if you like, political
authority if you could at least get a majority of members of the Security Council to
say they would agree such a resolution even vetoed.”133
439.  Asked whether a vetoed resolution would have undermined the authority for
military action in resolution 1441, Mr Blair said:
“No, it would not have undermined that because we were saying that we accept
that we believed we had authority in 1441, but it would have allowed us politically to
say we had the majority of the Security Council. So had we ended up in a situation
where Chile and Mexico had said ‘We are with you’. We would probably have put
this resolution down, had it vetoed.”134
FRANCE’S POSITION
440.  In a statement on 13 March, Mr de Villepin rejected the UK’s tests.
441.  In a statement issued on 13 March, Mr de Villepin said that the UK proposals
did “not address the issues raised by the international community”.135 The aim was
“not to grant Iraq a few extra days before embarking on a path leading to the use of
force, but to move resolutely forward on the peaceful disarmament route”. Inspections
were “a credible alternative to war” and were “producing results” as Dr Blix and
Dr ElBaradei had “pointed out in the 7 March report”. In the “spirit” of resolution 1441,
France wanted “a realistic timeframe in which to achieve effective disarmament”.
Success would “demand” Iraq’s “full and wholehearted co-operation”.
442.  In subsequent interviews for French media, Mr de Villepin stated that the UK
proposal embraced “the idea of an ultimatum, of the automaticity of the recourse
to force” which for France “was unacceptable”.136 He pointed out that the US had
“a determining role” as it was “maintaining that the die is cast” and was “intent on
moving towards a military intervention”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

443.  Mr Straw characterised France’s position as “extraordinary”.
444.  In remarks to the press in Downing Street, Mr Straw said that he found it
“extraordinary” that France had rejected the UK’s proposals “without even proper
consideration”.137 That made a peaceful resolution of the crisis “more difficult”.
445.  On 13 March, Sir David Manning asked Mr Rycroft for the full text of President
Chirac’s remarks of 10 March, which was circulated within No.10.138
446.  President Chirac’s Diplomatic Adviser, Mr Maurice Gourdault-Montagne,
complained about the UK Government’s “increasingly polemical approach”, its
interpretation of President Chirac’s remarks out of context, and the difficulties
with the UK tests.
447.  Sir John Holmes robustly defended the UK position.
448.  Mr Gourdault-Montagne telephoned Sir John Holmes at lunch time on 13 March
“to complain about the increasingly polemical approach” the UK was taking.139
449.  Mr Gourdault-Montagne stated that the UK approach “ran counter to the
understanding hitherto that we should try to minimise the bilateral fall-out and avoid
mutual or personalised criticism”. France was “particularly upset by our repeated taking
out of context … the President’s remarks on the veto in all circumstances”. The UK
“must be well aware that he had been talking about the particular circumstances that
evening … It was not reasonable to distort what he had said in this way.” Mr Straw’s
reaction to Mr de Villepin’s statement “had also seemed excessively sharp”.
450.  Sir John Holmes reported that he had responded that France:
“… could hardly be surprised if it became harder to avoid criticism of the French
position when they had spelled out their intention to veto the draft of their allies,
apparently whatever it said. The French were doing everything they could to block
us, not least in our attempt to give a last chance to Saddam to disarm peacefully and
to achieve the second resolution which would reunite the international community
and make international participation in the next stage easier. Villepin’s statement …
this morning attacking our proposals had been particularly hard to take.”
451.  Sir John stated that the UK “conditions” were taken from the UNMOVIC report
and “were precisely the questions which needed answering if we were to conclude that
Saddam Hussein had taken a strategic decision to disarm”.
452.  Mr Gourdault-Montagne responded by saying that the requirement that Saddam
Hussein should appear on TV to apologise was “a nonsense”. The UK “knew the Arab

world better than that”; and the UK was “still on the line of an ultimatum with an absurdly
short deadline”. France’s position had been “consistent and coherent throughout”, and it
had “warned” the UK “not to underestimate” its “determination to carry this position to its
logical conclusion”.
453.  Sir John stated that he “respected the French right to have a different position, but
there had been no need to go as far as a veto, and a deliberate move to declare it in
advance to try to influence others against our ideas”. He added that:
“France seemed to be forgetting what was in 1441 – Saddam had to make an
immediate and accurate declaration and co-operate fully and immediately … or face
the consequences. He had done neither of these things. We could not simply let
things drift.”
454.  Mr Gourdault-Montagne replied that “the inspectors had made clear that the
process was working, even if co-operation was not total. In these circumstances, it was
not right to rush to war.” He repeated “in a spirit of friendship” that what the UK was
doing “was against what the French had … thought was agreed between us. The French
had been very careful to avoid any such thing …”
455.  Sir John concluded that Mr Gourdault-Montagne “should appreciate the extent
to which France had pushed her position against her closest allies was hard to
understand”. The UK “had offered to try to find common ground several times but to
no avail”.
456.  Sir John also recorded that he had been told by the US Ambassador to France
that “he had seen Mr de Villepin the previous evening to enquire what lay behind
the President’s words on the veto”. Mr de Villepin “had claimed US and French
positions were really quite close, but the problem was the lack of flexibility in the US
stance”. The Ambassador had advised him to speak to Secretary Powell and they had
subsequently “spoken at length” but their “positions were too far apart … on timescale
and automaticity” to reach agreement: “Like us, the Americans judged that Chirac was
not really looking for a way out.”
457.  Sir John commented that it was:
“Predictable that the French would react in this way. There is a clear danger of an
upward spiral of polemics which could make working together afterwards harder.
But our position can hardly surprise the French, nor the fact that we are using
Chirac’s words against him when the stakes are so high – he did say them, even
if he may not have meant to express quite what we have chosen to interpret.”
458.  Mr de Villepin told Mr Straw that France was willing to look at an ultimatum
as long as the Security Council was responsible for the final decision on action.
459.  Mr Straw responded that France had made life very difficult for the UK.

479

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

460.  In response to a suggestion that France and the UK should look for a point
of compromise, Mr Straw replied that “the key decision had to be made in the
Security Council” and “no one on 10 March had said that Saddam Hussein was
complying with his obligations. He was therefore in further material breach.”
461.  Mr de Villepin also telephoned Mr Straw on 13 March. The record stated that he:
“… said France was still willing to consider any new proposals … ready to discuss
any solution based on benchmarks … [and] any timetable, even a reduced one, if
that was ‘satisfactory for you and the US’. His bottom line focused on automaticity.
France could work on any mechanism which contained an ultimatum as long as it
was the Security Council which took full responsibility at the end of any deadline.”140
462.  Mr Straw said that President Chirac’s statement on 10 March that “France would
vote against a second resolution ‘whatever the circumstances’ had caused great
difficulties. It was clear that France would veto.”
463.  Mr de Villepin responded that President Chirac had “never said that”; he “had not
meant that France would not try to find common ground”; nor “that, whatever happened,
France would vote no”. His comments had been “only in the context of text [of the draft
resolution] on the table” on 10 March.
464.  Mr Straw replied that:
“… he had read the comments differently. It had made life very difficult in the US.
They had assumed France would vote no in any circumstances. As a result they
were now falling back on UNSCR 1441. The UK had, however, managed to keep
dialogue going through the weekend. The UK had never said that 1441 contained
automaticity … But the UK did not want Iraq stringing things out. If things went on
too long, the military threat was degraded.”
465.  In response to a request from Mr de Villepin that they should look for “a point of
compromise” with a meeting of the Security Council following a further report from the
inspectors “perhaps in one month, two months or perhaps just three weeks”, Mr Straw
pointed out:
“The key decision had to be made by the Security Council. The inspectors’ role was
to provide evidence, although others could too. It was clear that Iraq was in material
breach. Though there were many different positions in the Security Council, no one
on 10 March had said that Saddam Hussein was complying with his obligations.
He was therefore in further material breach.”

Foreign Minister, 13 March’.

466.  Later in the conversation, Mr Straw:
“… briefly described the importance of the UK’s new benchmarks. Unless Iraq
realised it was facing its final, final chance, the international community would not
get Iraq to face reality. Put bluntly, delay played into the hands of those in the US
who said we should not go down the UN route. That said, he was happy to see
new propositions at any time.”
467.  Mr de Villepin concluded that “a way forward could be found”. Mr Straw replied
that “there would have to be discussion of these issues at Heads of Government level,
though not in New York”.
468.  The UK Embassy in Paris reported that Mr de Villepin had followed his rejection
of the UK’s proposals on 13 March with a briefing emphasising France’s wish to find a
solution leading to consensus in the Security Council and referring to his conversation
with Mr Straw.141
469.  Asked to confirm that France did not exclude an ultimatum, a senior French
Foreign Ministry official had, however, been “adamant: any ultimatum that did not leave
the final decision to the Security Council constituted a red line … The French were open
to any solution that enabled inspections to continue.” The official had claimed that a
failed attempt to get a second resolution would annul the effects of the first resolution;
the Council would have refused to authorise military intervention and any intervention
would be outside the Charter and “at the limit of aggression”.
470.  The Embassy concluded that Mr de Villepin’s position was “a tactical move
intended to deflect criticism” of President Chirac’s announcement of a veto “‘whatever
the circumstances”: “It was too little, too late – and the French know it.”
MINISTERIAL MEETING TO DISCUSS THE MILITARY PLAN
471.  Mr Blair agreed the military plan later on 13 March.
472.  On 13 March, Mr Blair held a meeting, with Mr Prescott, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon
and Adm Boyce to discuss the timing of the start of the military campaign and formal
approval of the military plan set out in Mr Watkins’ letter of 11 March (see Section 6.2).142
There was “a discussion about the timing of the end of the UN process … and the
start of military action”. It was agreed that Mr Blair would pursue the timing issues with
President Bush.

473.  Adm Boyce advised that:
“… the full moon meant that a later start date […] would certainly be preferable,
but that the projected date was not a show stopper. The US military shared the
preference for a later date, but had been told to accept the earlier date.”
474.  Sir David Manning confirmed Mr Blair’s approval for the plan in a letter to
Mr Watkins the following day.143
475.  Reflecting discussion at the JIC on 12 March, the Assessments Staff produced
a JIC Note on Saddam Hussein’s plan to defend Baghdad, on 13 March.144 The detail
of the JIC Note is addressed in Section 6.2.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 13 MARCH 2003
476.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed withdrawing the resolution on
17 March followed by a US ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to leave within 48 hours.
There would be no US military action until after the vote in the House of Commons
on 18 March.
477.  Mr Blair continued to press President Bush to publish the Road Map because
of its impact on domestic opinion in the UK as well as its strategic impact.
478.  Mr Blair also suggested their meeting in the next few days should produce
“something” on the UN “angle” addressing post-conflict issues.
479.  Mr Campbell spoke to Mr Bartlett about the proposed meeting between President
Bush and Mr Blair.145 President Bush was prepared to come to London but Mr Campbell
(and Mr Blair) considered that was “not what we needed”.
480.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that Mr Blair was keen to have a meeting with
President Bush and Mr Aznar but the weekend might be very difficult. The political
situation in the UK:
“… remained extremely tense … Condi [Dr Rice] should not underestimate the
political pressure we were now under. There might be resignations from the Cabinet
… We had a huge fight on our hands. We needed all the help we could get.”146
Sir David emphasised the importance of the US publishing the Road Map to influence
opinion in the UK.
481.  Sir David and Dr Rice also agreed the need for experts to discuss the UK’s
proposals for the role of the UN in a post-conflict Iraq. The main area of debate was

likely to be the relationship between a UN Co-ordinator and the military authorities.
Sir David reported that “Washington wanted something that was more or less the
reverse of the situation in Afghanistan where Brahimi [Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, Special
Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Afghanistan and Head of the UN
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, October 2001 to December 2004] was pre-eminent
and the military were subordinate”.
482.  Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the prospects for a vote in the House
of Commons and a Road Map for the Middle East.147 Mr Blair said that it would have
considerable impact on political opinion in the UK. Later he commented on its “totemic
significance” in the Middle East.
483.  On the UN, Mr Blair commented that the “haggling over texts in New York
was frustrating and muddied the waters. But it was buying the vital time we needed
this weekend.”
484.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the possibility of a meeting in the next
few days. Mr Blair said that it would be useful if something on aftermath issues could
emerge from that meeting “with a UN angle”.
485.  A discussion on the military timetable was reported separately.148 That envisaged
the withdrawal of the resolution on 17 March followed by a speech from President Bush
which would give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to leave within 48 hours. He (President
Bush) would call for freedom for the Iraqi people and outline the legal base for
military action.
486.  There would be no military action before a vote in the UK Parliament on 18 March.
President Bush would announce the following day that military action had begun. The
main air campaign was planned to begin on 22 March.
487.  In a conversation after the telephone call between Mr Blair and President Bush,
Mr Bartlett advised Mr Campbell that the meeting had been postponed to 16 March, and
they had agreed on the Azores as the venue.149
488.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“Bush said they could do the Road Map, give it to the Israelis and Palestinians once
Abu Mazen [about to become Palestinian Prime Minister] accepts the position.
“TB said that would make a big difference, anything up to fifty votes. ‘It’ll cost me
50,000’, said Bush. TB said he had seen a group of ‘wobbly MPs’ who were all clear
the Road Map would help. TB said it might also help him hang on to a couple of

Cabinet Ministers. GWB [President Bush] suggested he might be better off without
them. He clearly could not fathom why the Road Map mattered so much. He had
been reluctant because of Arafat. He then said ‘Tell Alastair, like I’m telling my boys,
that I don’t want to read a word about this until I’ve said it. It is in our interests that
I come out and say this, and it’s clear I mean it.’
“TB said the French thought they had lost the initiative and were getting worried. He
felt we had to keep in very close touch with Mexico and Chile over the weekend. He
was worried the French would come up with a counter-proposal and win them over.”
489.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“They kept going back to the Parliamentary arithmetic. TB said it was knife edge …
He said I know you think I have gone mad about the Road Map but it really will help.
“Bush said that Rumsfeld had asked him to apologise to TB.
“He [Bush] said … After our vote, if we win, the order goes to Rumsfeld to get
their troops to move. Ops begin. He said he would not be doing a declaration of
war. Wednesday 8pm in the region … ‘They go …’ He intended to wait as long as
possible before saying the troops were in action.”150
490.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that he and President Bush were due to meet in the
Azores on 16 March “partly to bind in Spain and Portugal who were both supportive and
both of whose Prime Ministers were under enormous heat from hostile parliamentary
and public opinion”, and that:
“It was clear now that action was inevitable barring Saddam’s voluntary departure.
George had agreed to give him an ultimatum to quit. There was no expectation he
would, however.”151
DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK, 13 MARCH 2003
491.  Reporting developments in New York on 13 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock
warned that the UK tests had attracted no support, and that the US might be ready
to call a halt to the UN process on 15 March.
492.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported overnight on 13/14 March that:

•	

In a meeting with the “undecided six” he had hosted, the “Latins [had] come
down hard against the UK compromise package”. The main objections had
included the “perceived authorisation of force in the draft resolution” and a
desire to wait for UNMOVIC’s own list of key tasks which would issue early the
following week.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

•	

•	

Mr Lavrov had argued that the resolution was not necessary given that the
inspections were making progress; the side statement was based on an
unproven premise that Iraq had WMD; contained an arbitrary timeframe (shorter
than Blix’s months); and unacceptably left the decision on whether Iraq fulfilled
the tests with the member states. The Council should wait until the inspectors
submitted the list of key tasks the following week.
Mr de La Sablière had taken a similar position. France had “suspicions” that Iraq
had WMD but it could not hand over weapons that did not exist.152

493.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “explained again”:
“There had to be a test of Iraqi willingness to comply. I did not think anyone thought
that Iraqi compliance had been immediate, unconditional and active. We therefore
needed a ‘downpayment’ or the contract of inspections could not continue. We
were trying to create an alternative to the ‘serious consequences’ in 1441 … In the
next 24 hours I would wish to discuss with all members of the Council … We had
to maintain the two essential elements of 1441: pressure and the effective use of
inspections. The pendulum had swung too far to inspections only. The intention
of the draft was not to provide authorisation for the use of force. We already had
sufficient authorisation in 1441 and related resolutions provided the conditions in
1441 were met.”
494.  In subsequent discussion, Sir Jeremy stated:

•	
•	
•	

the “tests were a ‘downpayment’ on whether Iraqi co-operation would be
forthcoming”;
resolution “1441 was deliberately ambiguous on whether the Council or Member
States would judge Iraqi compliance. We would want the inspectors to report on
the facts”; and
“the timeframe had to reflect the realities on the ground and the need for
pressure on Iraq …”

495.  In comments to the press after the meeting, Sir Jeremy emphasised the need
for a strong signal of strategic change from Iraq and strict time limits based on
resolution 1441 not resolution 1284.
496.  In a subsequent telegram, Sir Jeremy commented that the US thought the
benchmark process was “running out of steam”, and that support from London would
be needed. That:
“… might take us through to the end of Friday. But by 15 March (if not before),
I suspect that Washington will be ready to call a halt to the UN process, no doubt
with some strong words about France and Russia.”153

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

497.  Dr Blix wrote that on 13 March Sir Jeremy had:
“… tried desperately to win support for the British benchmark paper. If he got
‘traction’ on it, he could be flexible on a number of points, even altogether dropping
the draft operative paragraph 3 or, indeed the whole draft resolution, which looked
like an ultimatum. Although this step was presented as a last concession, the
political signal of the benchmark paper standing alone would probably be seen as
an ultimatum. It would be understood that if the declaration was not made and/or
the benchmarks not attained, serious consequences could be expected.”154
498.  Asked by the Inquiry if he was aware in the second half of the week beginning
10 March that the Prime Minister and the President had decided on 12 March
that the game was up; and that the UK would, for appearances’ sake, continue
negotiations in New York for a couple more days, and then withdraw the resolution,
Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied “No”.155
499.  Sir Jeremy added that activity had “really stopped after Wednesday [12 March]”
and that:
“On Thursday morning, which was probably my most difficult day, I suspected that
somebody would put down an alternative resolution, saying that the use of force
should not be allowed, because we knew that the Mexicans and the Chileans were
beginning to draft that …
“… By Friday morning there was an eerie silence. Nothing was happening. We were
not negotiating. Nobody was putting down anything against us. We knew that the
allies were going to meet … at the weekend, and there was no negotiating going
on in New York.”
THE DIVISIONS IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL
500.  Although there had been unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and
monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm
Iraq when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was no such consensus in the
Security Council in March 2003.
501.  Although the Security Council had unanimously agreed resolution 1441 on
8 November, there were marked differences in the positions of the members of the
Council, particularly between the five Permanent Members – China, France, Russia,
the US and the UK, reflecting the history of the Security Council’s role in relation to Iraq
since 1991.

502.  As the preceding Sections of the Report show:

•	
•	

France and Russia had consistently expressed reservations about US and UK
policy on Iraq and the consequences of military action. In particular, they were
concerned about the use of force without clear evidence that Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction and without an explicit authorisation by the Security Council.
Members of the Security Council had differing views of Iraq’s position and
whether or not its actions indicated a strategic decision to co-operate with the
requirements of resolution 1441.

503.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that:

•	
•	
•	
•	

he had been in no doubt that France and Russia, accompanied consistently
by Germany, would be fighting the UK all the way on the proposed second
resolution;
the US, the UK, Spain and Bulgaria were a “reasonably solid quartet”;
China and Syria “could not be expected to support the UK”; and
much of the resistance in the Security Council to the UK’s arguments revolved
around the question “What is the hurry when the inspectors are just getting down
to business again?”156

504.  Sir Jeremy judged “with hindsight that most members of the Security Council
would have opposed the use of force … on almost any timing unless the inspectors
had succeeded in exposing Iraq’s deception with the discovery of an active chemical
or biological weapon”.
505.  Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry, “I never felt that we got close to having nine positive
votes in the bag” and that when he was asked by London how many votes he felt were
sure, he would say four:
“I would never report it back to London that I had more than four sure votes.”157
506.  Sir Jeremy said that President Chirac’s remarks on 10 March:
“… made my life more difficult, because it made the ‘undecided six’, for instance,
believe that we were now going through the motions of something that was not
going to produce a result; therefore why should they do something unpopular
with their public opinions at home in siding with the United States on attacking an
Islamic country like Iraq, or whatever the reasons were domestically, when clearly
the Security Council was not going to reach anything if a Permanent Member had
pre‑declared a veto?
“So it did rather undercut the ground that we were on, yes.”158

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

507.  Asked whether President Chirac’s statement was “simply saying what everybody
already knew, and what to a degree had already been said by the French in public”,
Sir Jeremy replied:
“Yes, but saying it at Presidential level very publicly changed the political effect
of the French position on the rest of the Security Council.”159
508.  Sir Jeremy subsequently told the Inquiry that the effect of the statement had
“considerably lessened” the chances of turning the middle-ground six round and
“therefore it was quite an important turning point in the public politics”.160 President
Chirac’s statement had an impact “on the little tiny bit of momentum we still had in
the Security Council with the middle ground”.
509.  Sir Jeremy stated that:
“… we knew we had only a minority chance of achieving a second resolution … but
with the United States in the game pulling out all the stops, you never quite know
when countries opposing them may be pulled into another position.”161
510.  Asked what, at the beginning of the negotiation, he had thought the chances
of success in the second resolution were, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry:
“Less than 50 percent.”162 Sir Jeremy added that hindsight discoloured his recollection
but, “in my mind, between a quarter and a third of a chance that we might do this”.
He “wasn’t advising London that we were likely to succeed”.
511.  Asked about his statement that the UK never had more than four firm votes,
Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied:
“Right at the end. We knew we had four. We were after those six to make it ten, the
middle-ground members. Each of those six at some point during February, as they
were being chased round by Baroness Amos and others, trying to persuade them in
their capitals to follow us, said that they might do it or were going to follow us, and
then backed off when they saw that the others weren’t following. So we were herding
cats unsuccessfully in that respect, and never got all six together to have confidence
in each other’s preparedness to do it.”163
512.  Sir David Manning did not think that the middle-ground six would have supported
action in the timeframe that was under discussion:
“… if there had been more time, I think that the six in the UN – their minds weren’t
necessarily closed … if you had got a different dynamic going in February, March,
April between the leaders on the basis of whatever Blix was saying, and there

seemed to be more common ground, then it was possible that you could have found
some kind of common resolution.”164
513.  Asked whether Ministers had been over-optimistic in tabling the second resolution,
thinking that France and Russia would agree to it, Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry:
“It was always an optimistic approach to think you would get a second resolution and
you would get nine votes for it, as the struggle to get those votes demonstrated very
clearly in the weeks that followed.”165
514.  Sir John Holmes stated that France thought the timelines and tests in the draft
resolution were “deliberately impossible” for Saddam Hussein to pass and were “not
a way of actually avoiding war but was simply a way of legitimising it”.166 That was why
it was “so strongly opposed”.
515.  Asked if there were any circumstances in which France might have supported a
second resolution authorising the use of force, Sir John said that, by that stage, “it would
have taken something pretty dramatic”, such as a find by the inspectors or reckless
behaviour by Saddam Hussein, to change the mind of France.167
516.  Mr Straw told the Inquiry that, before President Chirac’s statement of 10 March,
the UK had “got the three African states on board, we thought we had the Chileans
and the Mexicans” although the negotiations were finely balanced.168 The moment
when he did not think it would be possible to achieve a second resolution was when
he had “turned on the television” and seen “President Chirac saying that, whatever the
circumstances, France would veto a second resolution”.
517.  Later, Mr Straw took a more qualified view:
“… our judgement was that we thought that the three African states were highly
likely to support a resolution. The problem was between … Chile and Mexico and
President Fox and President Lagos [each] looking over [his] … shoulder at the
other one. My own view is – not that – in the absence of the Chirac ‘veto’ statement
on 10 March, we would have got their support, but it would have been much
more probable.”169
518.  Mr Straw also stated:
“… the great danger, which we felt we faced, was that, if you didn’t bring this to a
conclusion one way or the other quite quickly, then the whole strategy of diplomacy

backed by the threat, and if necessary, the use of force, would fall away and that’s
what Saddam wanted.”170
519.  Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of the FCO UN Department, told the Inquiry:
“I am not sure that the American Administration was ever formally committed to
a second resolution … I think … they were willing to let us have a go at trying …
They certainly did not see a legal necessity for it and they, I think, obviously feared
that it could only result in more complication at the UN Security Council.”171
520.  Asked whether that was his understanding, Mr Straw replied:
“That was, of course, the downside. That it might expose divisions rather than
resolve them. I still with the benefit of hindsight think it was worth attempting the
second resolution. We were elusively close, in my judgement, to getting those magic
nine votes and no veto but it didn’t happen. That was their concern. That said, the
Americans, certainly Secretary Powell, were very assiduous in seeking to build up
support for the second resolution. There are records that you will have seen where
he reports he worked the phones with various people.”172
521.  In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that the leaders of the African nations, Chile and
Mexico “would not put their heads above the parapet knowing that France would veto
‘whatever the circumstances’. The resolution was dying.”173
522.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the UK had come “pretty close” to a majority of votes;
and that, “we could have got Chile and Mexico actually if the French position had been
less emphatic”.174

Events of 14 March 2003
523.  In a minute of 14 March, Mr Jonathan Powell recorded that Mr Blair had agreed
that he would start holding meetings of a “War Cabinet” from 19 March.175
524.  The composition of the War Cabinet is addressed in Section 2.
PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S CONVERSATION WITH MR BLAIR
525.  President Chirac asked Mr Blair on 14 March if Mr Straw and Mr de Villepin
could discuss whether there was sufficient flexibility to find an agreed way
forward. Mr Blair agreed.

526.  Mr Blair had “insisted that it must be the Security Council” which decided
whether Saddam Hussein had co-operated, not the inspectors.
527.  President Chirac asked to speak to Mr Blair on 14 March.176
528.  Drawing the report of Mr Straw’s conversation with Mr de Villepin on 13 March
to Mr Blair’s attention before the telephone call with President Chirac, Sir David
Manning wrote:
“No surprises: will probably complain we are misrepresenting him; will offer new
effort based on the shorter time line but no automaticity. You can certainly point
to his frenetic efforts to block us at every turn.”177
529.  President Chirac told Mr Blair that France was “content to proceed ‘in the logic of
UNSCR 1441’; but it could not accept an ultimatum or any ‘automaticity’ of recourse to
force”.178 He proposed looking at a new resolution in line with resolution 1441, “provided
that it excluded these options”.
530.  Mr Blair “said that we needed clear, specific ‘tests’ to measure whether Saddam
was co-operating”. Of the six tests proposed by the UK, “five were from the Blix ‘clusters’
report and the sixth had been proposed by the inspectors and was intended to provide
a mechanism for junior Iraqi officials and scientists to co-operate with the inspectors”.
531.  President Chirac “suggested that the UNMOVIC work programme might provide
a way forward. France was prepared to look at reducing the 120 day timeframe it
envisaged.”
532.  Mr Blair responded that “still did not get round the problem that if Saddam was
found to be in breach, all the [sic] followed was more discussion and we were back
where we started. It must be clear that … action would ensue.”
533.  In response to a question from President Chirac about whether it would be the
inspectors or the Security Council who decided whether Saddam had co-operated,
Mr Blair “insisted that it must be the Security Council”.
534.  President Chirac agreed, “although the Security Council should make its
judgement on the basis of the inspectors’ report”. He “wondered whether it would be
worth” Mr Straw and Mr de Villepin “discussing the situation to see if we could find some
flexibility”; or was it “too late”?
535.  Mr Blair said “every avenue must be explored”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

536.  President Chirac concluded that “talking direct was better than via TV and radio
broadcasts”. He had told Mr Blair that he did not want “disagreements over Iraq to have
an impact on the UK and France’s joint interests in Europe” and they should talk before
the European Council on 20 March.
537.  Mr Blair “said that he too did not want things to become more difficult”. He “wanted
to ensure the strength of the UK/France relationship was not affected”.
538.  Mr Campbell suggested that Mr Straw was “instructed” to “concede nothing”
when he spoke to Mr de Villepin.
539.  Mr Campbell wrote that the discussion was “a lot friendlier than it might have been”
but President Chirac had been:
“… straight on to the point TB expected, namely he could see a way of co-operating
on the tests but it must be the inspectors who decide if Saddam is co-operating.
He said he could not support an ultimatum or anything taken as a support for
military action.
“TB said the problem with that was that it meant he could have as many last
chances and as much time as he [Saddam] wanted. There had to be automaticity
[trigger for attack].
“Chirac said there could not be automaticity.”179
540.  Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair and President Chirac had agreed Mr Straw
and Mr de Villepin should talk, but Mr Blair “issued instructions” to Mr Straw
“to concede nothing. There was intelligence suggesting the French were seeking
to get the undecided six to go for tests plus more time.” Mr Blair suspected
President Chirac “would move to a position of automaticity but inspectors are the sole
judges of compliance”.
541.  Asked whether the UK had been told by France that it was misrepresenting
President Chirac’s position, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he had spoken to President
Chirac on 14 March and:
“The French position was very, very clear. It wasn’t that they would veto any
resolution, it is that they would veto a resolution that authorised force in the event
of breach.”180
542.  Mr de Villepin stated that no country had shown any support for the UK
proposals.

543.  In an interview with BBC Newsnight on 14 March, Mr de Villepin asked what game
was being played and whether there was a search for a “scapegoat in order to accuse
one country of being irresponsible”.181 He stated that: “We should present the real
position of both countries.”
544.  Mr de Villepin pointed out that “no country … had shown any support” for the UK
proposals tabled in the Security Council late on 12 March.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
545.  In a conversation with President Bush about the French position and what
to say when the resolution was pulled, Mr Blair proposed that they would need to
show that France would not authorise the use of force in any circumstances.
546.  When Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 14 March they discussed the French
position and what to say about the French position when the decision was taken to pull
the resolution.182
547.  Mr Blair stated that:
“… we would need to do so as the reasonable party, showing that France would not
authorise the use of force in any circumstances, and demonstrating that we were
sticking to 1441.”
548.  Mr Blair said that at some point we needed to set out our views on
post-conflict, including humanitarian issues; a joint statement at the Azores Summit
would be welcome.
549.  Mr Campbell wrote:
“Bush said he was predicting a ‘landslide, baby!’
“TB said it was too close to call.
“Bush … The Azores was on.
“TB said we had to be seen striving all the way even if we felt the French made
it impossible.
“Bush said it was a ‘moment of truth’ meeting …
“TB said we must not let it be built up as a council of war. The more we talk about
the UN and the aftermath the better …

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“TB briefed on the Chirac call, said the divide was between those prepared to
consider military action and those who were not, who would give him [Saddam?]
as much time as he wanted.
“Bush said that he did not trust the French but we had to do a slow waltz with them
in the next few days. He felt they thought America was more guilty than Saddam.
“TB said that the French appearing to be so unreasonable had been a big mistake
by Chirac.”183
550.  Asked whether he had agreed with President Bush on 14 March that “the game
was up”, Mr Blair said:
“The game was up in the sense that we were not going to get a resolution. This
was the second best … Our preference was to have got a resolution that passed
the Security Council … I was very conscious that I had Cabinet members who were
unhappy about this … that it might give us some political weight, I mean not much
frankly, but some if we could say at least we have a majority of members on our
side, even though we knew we were not going to get the resolution.”184
551.  Mr Blair added:
“It is simply a political point. If you can say, ‘Well we didn’t get the resolution
because France vetoed but nonetheless we got the majority of the Security Council
in our favour,’ it would allow us to say that … It would have helped me. I would have
definitely used this in terms of the presentation of the case …”
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATIONS WITH PRESIDENT LAGOS
552.  President Lagos initially informed Mr Blair on 14 March that the UK
proposals did not have Chile’s support and that he was working on other ideas.
553.  Later President Lagos informed Mr Blair that he would not pursue his
proposals unless Mr Blair or President Bush asked him to.
554.  No.10 reported that President Lagos told Mr Blair on 14 March that the “elected
six” had been working on some ideas which they planned to announce at “noon”
(New York time).185 Those ideas were “based on reasonable benchmarks and timing,
but also the use of force if Saddam did not comply”.
555.  President Lagos also told Mr Blair that the draft resolution tabled on 7 March did
not have Chile’s support and he “had the impression that France and Russia were now

looking for a real solution” in the Security Council. There was “a slim chance that war
could be avoided within the next 3-4 days”. He would be holding a press conference
in three hours.
556.  Mr Blair had responded that it was not clear how things would develop. The
Security Council “did not want to vote on a resolution that would be vetoed. Both France
and Russia were very clear that they would not allow a resolution which authorised the
use of force.”
557.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported at 5.50pm on 14 March that the US, UK and
Spanish Permanent Representatives had met early that morning to discuss how to react
to the new proposal forming amongst the “middle-ground six (U-6)”. They had agreed:

•	
•	

the proposal that “the Council would meet at the end of an ultimatum period to
decide on Iraq’s co-operation towards compliance with the tests was completely
unacceptable”; and
to “major on the primacy of 1441” and tell contacts that “if any of the
U-6 abandoned that baseline, they would do huge damage to the
Security Council”.186

558.  President Lagos telephoned No.10 that evening and, in the absence of Mr Blair,
spoke to Mr Rycroft to draw attention to the key points in his statement, including the
benchmarks proposed by the UK and a deadline of three weeks, not longer, reflecting
Mr Blair’s advice.187
559.  Mr Rycroft also reported that President Lagos would not push the proposal further
unless President Bush or Mr Blair wanted him to; and that he [Lagos] had not received
any reaction from other Security Council members.
560.  An unofficial translation of President Lagos’ statement produced by the British
Embassy Santiago reported that it expressed “full understanding of the United States
concern for the threats posed to its security”, which were “also threats to world
security”.188 It also stated that Chile continued to make “best efforts to avert war” while
fully supporting the “UN decision aimed at bringing to full and verified compliance the
Iraqi disarmament process” mandated in resolution 1441. President Lagos referred
to “a special co-operative bond”, which Chile had established with the UK.
561.  The proposal was “for the Security Council to impose … five critical conditions”
derived from the inspection process which should be fulfilled “within a realistic time
period not later than three weeks as from the date on which they are approved by the
Security Council”. Verification of compliance was to be reported by inspectors with the
Security Council controlling the decisions that followed.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

562.  The Chilean proposal omitted the demand for a public statement by Saddam
Hussein but repeated the UK proposal for interviews outside Iraq. The remaining tests
were a subset of the UK proposals, requiring Iraq to:

•	
•	
•	
•	

disclose any remaining warhead with mustard gas or mustard gas bombs or
any documentation to prove their destruction;
disclose the 10,000 litres of anthrax or account for its destruction;
destroy any Al Samoud 2 missiles and their components; and
disclose any information stating that “Remote Control” vehicles do not carry
chemical weapons.

563.  President Lagos also stated that the “great powers” had “unfortunately failed to
include” the “delicate equilibrium” between “reasonable goals and realistic deadlines”
in their proposed resolutions. Chile would “not concur with a resolution” that failed “to
exhaust all the means available to complete Iraqi disarmament and preserve world
peace”. It was “still possible to reach an understanding and strengthen international
unity”; and that unity would be “the only guarantee of a stable, fair peace”. Chile believed
that Iraqi disarmament could “still be done while preserving and strengthening the
international institutional framework afforded by the United Nations and its Charter, and
seeking any other alternative for the rule of law to prevail over force”.
564.  Dr Blix wrote that the Chilean proposal replaced the requirement for a televised
speech from Saddam Hussein with a less humiliating letter from the Iraqi leadership and
extended the time given for attainment of the benchmarks to three weeks or 30 days
and for Council collectively to assess if Iraq had attained the benchmarks and to decide
on further action.189 Chile was “not willing to let the Council abdicate this prerogative.
The US on the other hand were not ready to drop the claim of a right to go it alone.”
DEVELOPMENTS IN NEW YORK, 14 MARCH 2003
565.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that US pressure on Chile had contributed
to its decision to stop work on its proposal.
566.  Sir Jeremy told his colleagues in New York that the UK would continue
to look for agreement on its proposals. Key decisions would be made at the
Azores Summit.
567.  Reporting on developments on 14 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that the
U-6 had “made no further efforts to achieve consensus” and their proposal had been
“confirmed dead”.190

568.  Sir Jeremy commented that the process had “ground to a halt” because the text
leaked and the leaked version did not resemble the final draft and because President
Lagos had spoken out too soon, “alerting the US who then put on great pressure to kill
it”. A Chilean official had told the UK Mission that the US pressure on Chile in particular
had been “more … than that put on them to support the UK/US/Spain resolution”.
569.  When the EU Heads of Mission met to take stock on 14 March, Sir Jeremy
Greenstock told them “discussions were continuing” and he had made clear to the
African and Latin American members of the Council that he was “ready to talk at any
stage. But there remained differences on substance and procedure.” In response to
a comment from the German Ambassador that “both the British and U-6 proposals
were dead in the water”, Sir Jeremy replied that the UK “would keep going”; the Azores
Summit “represented a final opportunity”.
570.  A scheduled meeting of the P5 was cancelled because there was “little to
talk about”.
571.  Sir Jeremy also spoke to Dr Blix, and to Mr Annan about “the leading role” he
(Mr Annan) could play in the event of conflict “in healing wounds and reinserting the
UN into the post-conflict situation”.
572.  Sir Jeremy concluded:
“The fact of the Azores Summit, the collapse of the U-6 compromise under our
combined pressure and general exhaustion here in New York, have all added up
to a less troublesome day than we might have expected.
“Clearly key decisions on the resolution will be made at the Summit. In addition
to any other instructions, grateful if you could consider whether it is worth giving
UNMOVIC/IAEA and the UN advance notice of any announcement on next steps so
that they can make the earliest possible preparations to evacuate staff from Iraq …”
573.  Mr Campbell wrote that on 14 March “the diplomatic scene was going nowhere but
we kept going with the line we were working flat out for a second resolution”.191

UN inspectors and the IAEA and to complete the actions required by operative
paragraphs 8 to 13 of resolution 687 (OP1);
to afford Iraq “a final opportunity” to comply with its obligations (OP2);
that Iraq should provide “a currently accurate, full, and complete declaration
of all aspects of its programmes” within 30 days of the resolution (OP3); and
“that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq
pursuant to this resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and
co-operate fully in the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further
material breach of Iraq’s obligations and will be reported to the Council for
assessment …” (OP4).

575.  On 14 March, Lord Goldsmith asked for confirmation of Mr Blair’s view that Iraq
had “committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 of
resolution 1441”.192
576.  Mr David Brummell, Legal Secretary to the Law Officers, wrote to Mr Rycroft
on 14 March:
“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution
of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply
with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 and has thus
failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution.
The Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s
view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative]
paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgment for the Prime Minister, the
Attorney would be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”
577.  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell’s letter the following day, stating:
“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that Iraq is
in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 of UNSCR 1441, because of
‘false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this
resolution and failure to comply with, and co-operate fully in the implementation of,
this resolution’.”193
578.  It is unclear what specific grounds Mr Blair relied upon in reaching his view.
579.  Following receipt of Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March, Mr Blair neither requested
nor received considered advice addressing the evidence on which he expressed his
“unequivocal view” that Iraq was “in further material breach of its obligations”.
580.  The significance of Lord Goldsmith’s request and Mr Blair’s response are
addressed in Section 5.

581.  The preparation of a Written Answer on 17 March, setting out Lord Goldsmith’s
view of the legal basis for military action, is also addressed in Section 5.
THE FCO PAPER OF 15 MARCH, ‘IRAQI NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UNSCR 1441’
582.  A paper for publication providing examples of Iraq’s failure to comply with
the obligations imposed by the UN was produced by the FCO on 15 March.
583.  The question of what would constitute a further material breach as specified in
OP4 of resolution 1441 (2002) was the subject of considerable debate within the UK
Government in late 2002 (see Section 3.6).
584.  In January 2003, Mr Blair said that, if the inspectors’ reports established a pattern
of non-compliance, they would, in the absence of other evidence that Iraq had concealed
WMD (a “smoking gun”), be sufficient to secure Security Council support for a second
resolution stating that Iraq was in further material breach of resolution 1441.194
585.  Mr Blair proposed that the US and UK should seek to persuade others, including
Dr Blix, that this was the “true view” of resolution 1441.
586.  By the end of January, Mr Blair had taken a public position that Iraq was failing
fully to comply with resolution 1441, and that that was a further material breach (see
Section 3.6).
587.  In his advice of 7 March, Lord Goldsmith said that the views of UNMOVIC and the
IAEA would be highly significant in demonstrating hard evidence of non-compliance and
non-co-operation.195
588.  In his minute to Mr Blair of 11 March, Mr Straw wrote that the:
“… three recent meetings of the [Security] Council more than fulfil the requirement
for immediate consideration of reports of non-compliance. So we can say
convincingly that the process set out in resolution 1441 is complete.”196
589.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK Government should use “the overwhelming
evidence that Iraq has not used the four months” since the adoption of resolution 1441
“to co-operate ‘immediately, unconditionally and actively’” to make a “more compelling”
case to Parliament and public opinion. The UNMOVIC “clusters” document would be
a material help in making that case”.
590.  A draft of the FCO paper on Iraq’s failure to comply with resolution 1441, intended
to “demonstrate clearly the extent of Iraqi intransigence” was sent to Mr Straw’s Private

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Office and other FCO addressees on 13 March.197 It was agreed with the MOD, Defence
Intelligence Staff (DIS) and the Cabinet Office Assessments Staff.
591.  The paper was referred to in a note on the Attorney General’s file, in relation to
the need for “further material to be assembled” as discussed by Lord Goldsmith and
Mr Straw, in their meeting late on 13 March, to provide “evidence showing” that Iraq was
“in further material breach”. That listed a need for:
“•	 Any examples of false statements/omissions and (significant) non-co-operation
reported to Security Council pursuant to OP4 of SCR 1441.

•	
•	
•	

Any examples of Iraqi interference reported by Blix or ElBaradei to the Council
pursuant to OP11.
For these purposes, we need to trawl through statements from the draft
Command Paper on Iraqi non-compliance which is to be published.
See attached FCO paper Iraqi non-compliance with UNSCR 1441 of
13 March 2003.”198

592.  A note of a conversation with Ms Kara Owen in Mr Straw’s Private Office,
on 14 March, recorded that Mr Brummell had made the following points on Lord
Goldsmith’s behalf:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“Demonstration of breaches of UNSCR 1441 are critical to our legal case.
Therefore we must be scrupulously careful to ensure that the best examples
of non-compliance are referred to.”
“It would be distinctly unhelpful to our legal case if the examples of non
compliance … were weak or inadequate; and it would be difficult – indeed it
would be too late – to seek to add further (better) examples ‘after the event’.”
The FCO needed to check the document they were preparing “very carefully”
and subject it to “the tightest scrutiny”.
The document should include “a caveat … acknowledging that the examples
of non-compliance … were not exhaustive but illustrative”.
The submission to Mr Straw should reflect those points.199

593.  Mr Brummell’s record of his conversation with Ms Owen on 14 March also
stated that he had been informed that the FCO paper would be sent out with a letter
from Mr Blair to Ministerial colleagues on 17 March, “after Cabinet”. Mr Blair’s letter
would also contain a “one page” summary of the legal position, which was “news”
to Mr Brummell. A subsequent conversation with Mr Rycroft had “confirmed that it
would be helpful if” Lord Goldsmith’s staff would draft that summary.

594.  The FCO paper was finalised on 15 March.200 It was produced by officials in the
FCO but drawn largely from official reports and statements by UN inspectors. It drew
heavily on UNMOVIC’s report, ‘Unresolved Disarmament Issues – Iraq’s Proscribed
Weapons Programmes’, the “clusters” document, which it characterised as
“a 173 page-long catalogue of Iraqi intransigence since 1991”.
595.  The paper examined the extent of Iraq’s non-compliance with the obligations
placed upon it by the UN Security Council in resolution 1441, which it stated was
“unambiguous”. Resolution 1441:

•	
•	
•	
•	

recognised the threat which Iraq’s non-compliance “and proliferation of weapons
of mass destruction and long-range missiles” posed to international peace and
security (preambular paragraph (PP) 3);
decided that Iraq had been and remained “in material breach of its obligations
under relevant resolutions” (OP1);
decided to “afford Iraq … a final opportunity to comply” (OP2); and
decided that “false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by
Iraq … and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in the
implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of
Iraq’s obligations” (OP4).

596.  Assessing Iraq’s “progress in complying with relevant provisions of UNSCR 1441”,
the paper stated that Iraq had “Not met” the requirement in five areas and had only
“Partially met” or “Not yet met” other demands.
597.  The FCO paper stated:

•	
•	

•	

Iraq had “Not met” the requirement for a “currently accurate, full, and
complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes”. The Iraqi declaration,
of 7 December, “did not contain any new information to answer any of the
outstanding questions”, and there were “significant falsehoods”.
Iraq had not provided UNMOVIC and the IAEA with “immediate, unimpeded,
unrestricted, and private access to all officials and other persons whom
UNMOVIC or the IAEA wish to interview”. Only 16 interviews had taken
place and there was “reason to believe” that the Iraqi authorities had
intimidated interviewees.
No interviews had taken place outside Iraq. The paper cited “evidence that
Iraqi scientists have been intimidated into refusing interviews … They – and
their families – have been threatened with execution if they deviate from the
official line.”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	

Iraq had not provided UNMOVIC and the IAEA with “the names of all personnel
currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear, and
ballistic missile programmes and the associated … facilities”.
Iraq was not co-operating “immediately, unconditionally, and actively with
UNMOVIC and the IAEA”. It had not answered the outstanding questions
raised by UNSCOM when it was forced to withdraw or by the 1999 Amorim
panel (see Section 1.1).

598.  The list of unresolved “outstanding issues” included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“Failure to account adequately for SCUD-type missiles and components
‘suggests that these items may have been retained for a prohibited
missile force’.”
“Failure to explain why Iraq has built a missile test stand at al-Rafah that
can accommodate missiles with over four times the thrust of the prohibited
Al Samoud missile.”
“[A]t least 80 tonnes (in 550 shells and 450 aerial bombs)” of “unaccounted for”
mustard gas, and that quantity “could be substantially higher”.
Whether Iraq had retained “some capability with regard to VX”.
Whether Iraq’s claimed destruction of bulk agent, including anthrax, in 1991
had occurred.
Failure to account for the aircraft associated with the L-29 RPV programme.

599.  The FCO paper also stated that Iraq had only:

•	
•	
•	

“Partially met” the requirement for free and unrestricted use of aircraft “belatedly
and under pressure”.
“Not yet met” the requirement to destroy Al Samoud missiles and associated
equipment. It stated that the programme of destruction had started by the
deadline set by UNMOVIC, but suggested it could be stopped “at any time”.
“Partially met” the requirement not to “take or threaten hostile acts”, although
it stated “inspections had been largely incident-free”.

600.  The paper also identified Iraqi “gestures” which it characterised as examples
of a “pretence of co-operation”.
601.  The paper was sent to all Members of Parliament on 17 March.201
602.  The statements in the FCO paper about Iraq’s approach to interviews and its
intimidation of personnel were based on the UK’s interpretation of the intelligence
reporting it had received that Iraq was actively and successfully pursuing a policy
of concealing its programmes and deceiving and obstructing the inspectors.

‘Iraqi Non‑Compliance with UNSCR 1441’.

603.  The FCO paper did not evaluate the seriousness of either the five
requirements which Iraq had “Not met” or the other areas where Iraq had only
“Partially met” or “Not yet met” the requirement.
604.  The way in which that intelligence was drawn on in briefings for and statements
by Ministers, and the withdrawal of some of the reporting in September 2004, is
addressed in Section 4.3.
605.  OP11 of resolution 1441 (2002) directed Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei “to report
immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities, as well as
any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations, including its obligations
regarding inspections under this resolution”.
606.  OP12 recorded that the Security Council had decided “to convene immediately
upon receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 … in order to consider
the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions
in order to secure international peace and security”.
607.  The FCO paper did not mention that OP4 of resolution 1441 required a further
material breach to be “reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with
paragraphs 11 and 12” of the resolution. Nor did it contain any reference to the Security
Council having done so.
608.  In setting out the analysis, there were a number of salient points the FCO paper
did not make, including:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Dr Blix had reminded Mr Blair on 6 February that the material described as
“unaccounted for” in UNSCOM’s report of 1999 was not necessarily present in
Iraq; and that it would be “paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn
out to be very little”.202
Dr Blix made a similar point in his report to the Security Council on 7 March.203
The quantities of material described as “unaccounted for” were estimates
extrapolated from data in UNSCOM official records.
Dr Blix had not at that point requested any interviews outside Iraq.
He told the Security Council on 7 March that he would be requesting such
interviews “shortly”.
There had been no problems once aircraft flights over Iraq started.
UNMOVIC had not reached a conclusion on the purpose of the test stand
at al‑Rafah or the L-29 RPV programme.
Iraq had already destroyed 65 of the 120 short-range Al Samoud 2 missiles
it was estimated to possess.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

609.  UNMOVIC had informed Sir Jeremy Greenstock on 11 March that Iraq had
provided names of personnel currently and formerly associated with Iraq’s WMD
programmes and had said “they were willing to provide more in particular areas
on request”.204
610.  Dr Blix’s reports to the Security Council presented a nuanced picture. He did
not say that Iraq was complying, but neither he nor Dr ElBaradei had reported to the
Security Council that Iraq was not complying or that the inspectors could not complete
their tasks.
611.  In his report of 7 March, Dr Blix stated that, when the quarterly report had been
finalised, there had still been “relatively little tangible progress to note” and the report
had been “cautious”.205 By 7 March, however, there was more. Iraq had accepted
the destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles and associated items and that constituted
a “substantial measure of disarmament … the first since the middle 1990s”.
612.  In relation to other recent Iraqi initiatives, Dr Blix stated:
“One can hardly avoid the impression that, after a period of somewhat reluctant
co‑operation, there has been an acceleration of initiatives from the Iraqi side since
the end of January. This is welcome, but the value of these measures must be
soberly judged by how many question marks they actually succeed in straightening
out. This is not yet clear.”
613.  Dr Blix added that Iraq had not “persisted” in attaching conditions to inspections.
Recent Iraqi initiatives could not be said “to constitute ‘immediate’ co-operation. Nor do
they necessarily cover all areas of relevance”; but they were “nevertheless welcome”.
614.  Dr Blix was not reporting that he was unable to carry out inspections. He stated
that “Even with a pro-active Iraqi attitude” it would still take “months” to “verify sites
and items, analyse documents, interview relevant persons and draw conclusions”.
A document addressing unresolved disarmament issues and to identify key remaining
disarmament tasks, as required by resolution 1284 (1999), would be submitted later
that month.
615.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed nuclear
activities since the inspectors left in December 1998, and the recently increased level
of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security Council with an
assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.206

616.  Dr Blix told the Inquiry that he had been “pushed very hard” to conduct interviews
abroad.207 Resolution 1441 had provided for such interviews but did not say they were
mandatory. He:
“… never thought that you would get much out of it. It would only have been trouble,
but we would have been driven to it in the end. I think the push was so hard, so we
would have persuaded the Iraqis …”
617.  Dr Blix added that he did not think interviews outside Iraq were realistic but he
would have pursued them if there had been more time: “The pressure from the British
was also strong. [Mr] Blair felt very strongly about it.”208

Events of 15 and 16 March 2003
618.  In the entry in his diaries for 15 March, Mr Campbell wrote that there was a
meeting with Mr Blair at 8.30am. He was “clear now what the French would try – yes to
the tests, even to the possibility of military action, but they would push for a later date”.209
619.  That had been followed by a pre-meeting with Mr Prescott, Mr Brown and
Mr Douglas Alexander, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office. Mr Campbell commented:
“GB [Gordon Brown] was beginning to motor a bit, firing with good media and
political lines. He also felt we needed to explain more clearly why we had been so
keen to get the second resolution when now we were saying we didn’t need one.
The answer lay in the pressure we had been putting on the Iraqis, through the
building of international support. He also felt that we should be pressing publicly
over some of the questions he felt Blix had not fully answered.
“Goldsmith was happy for us to brief that in the coming days he would make clear
there was a legal base for action. We now had to build up the Azores as a genuine
diplomatic effort, which was not going to be easy …
“John Scarlett [Chairman of the JIC] joined us, reported signs of the Iraqis really
hunkering down, said there were reports of summary executions …
“Godric [Smith – Mr Blair’s Official Spokesman] and I were briefing Ministers and
then the media re the forthcoming AG [Attorney General] advice. A few decisions
having been taken, the travel of direction clear, we felt in a stronger position.”210

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

THE FCO GAME PLAN
620.  A Note for the Record written by Mr McDonald on 15 March reported that Cabinet
on 17 March would need:
“… to be choreographed with the Security Council meeting where Jeremy
Greenstock would announce that we were pulling our resolution.
“The Foreign Secretary assumed the Cabinet would meet sometime in the morning.
It will need specifically to approve the course of action proposed and to have passed
across the terms of the Commons motion for Tuesday.
“… it might be a good idea for him [Mr Straw] to do a statement on Monday to inform
colleagues of the decision to withdraw … A statement … might give us a better
chance of assessing from where the strongest arguments would come.”211
621.  The FCO advised No.10 that the UK’s “aim should be to leave the current
diplomatic process in a way that helps ensure that we can return to the Council shortly
for action on other important areas, such as amending the Iraq sanctions regime and
obtaining UN authorisation of post conflict arrangements”.212 That could best be done by
a “short statement” by Sir Jeremy Greenstock in informal Council consultations, making
clear that the UK “regretted that it had proved impossible to make progress on our text
and that we were not taking any further action on it”: “Ideally this should coincide with
any US announcement of a short final ultimatum to Iraq.”
622.  The FCO also identified the risk of a resolution being tabled in the Security
Council or the UN General Assembly criticising the use of force; the need to address
travel advice and the safety of UK nationals in the region; and the reaction to the US
announcement about publishing a Road Map on the MEPP.
623.  Mr Ricketts subsequently advised that Sir Jeremy Greenstock had pointed out “that
we should try to keep the issue open in the Security Council for as long as possible in
order to minimise the risk of rival initiatives”; and that “a key element” of that strategy
would be “to ensure that we do not say we are closing down or giving up on the Security
Council route”.213
624.  Sir David Manning recorded that Mr Blair had made those points “strongly” at the
Azores Summit.214

625.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that it was his “responsibility not to be
caught having allowed somebody to put down a resolution against us because I had
lost the initiative. I would have been criticised for that.”215
626.  The FCO advice on setting out a “Vision” for Iraq after the conflict at the Azores
Summit is addressed in Section 6.5.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 15 MARCH 2003
627.  In his discussion with President Bush on 15 March, Mr Blair proposed that
the main message from the Azores Summit should be that it was the final chance
for Saddam Hussein to demonstrate that he had taken the strategic decision to
avert war; and that members of the Security Council should be able to sanction
the use of force as Iraq was in material breach of its obligations.
628.  The UK would take the decision on the timing for bringing the UN process
to an end on 17 March.
629.  President Bush was trying to help Mr Blair achieve a majority for military
action in the Parliamentary Labour Party before the House of Commons vote
on 18 March.
630.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 15 March, he thanked him for the
announcement on the MEPP.216
631.  Mr Blair said that the main message for the Azores Summit should be that this
was a final chance for the UN to deliver, and that countries should be able to sanction
the use of force as Iraq was in material breach. They discussed the positions of various
countries and Mr Blair underlined the importance of appearing as reasonable as possible
when we pulled the UN resolution. The timing of that decision would be for the UK.
632.  Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the role of the UN post-conflict, the
need to have a post-conflict strategy to deal with the opponents of military action, and
the consequences of the experience on Iraq for the UN in the longer term.
633.  Mr Blair’s attempts to agree the role of the UN post-conflict with the US are
addressed in Section 6.5.
634.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell provided a long account of the conversation, including:
“He [President Bush] accepted that we had done the right thing on the Road Map.
‘Good advice and it has helped a lot.’ …

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Bush was pretty vile about Fox, Chirac and Schröder [Mr Gerhard Schröder, the
German Chancellor] and to a lesser extent Lagos. He wanted to go for a ‘coalition
of the willing’ meeting next week …
“TB said it was time for the UN to show it could do its job.
“Bush said that anything that weakened 1441 was not on. His plan now was:
1. get through Monday, 2. get through our vote; then 3. Coalition of the willing.
“He and TB then came up with the idea of doing the press conference before rather
than after the meeting in the Azores. I was opposed, felt it would fuel the idea it was
all a charade …
“His [Bush’s] main line was that anything that takes us back from 1441 was not
enough. This was the final stage of the diplomacy.
“TB said the UN had to be seen to do its job.
“Bush felt the TB lines re the divisions being between those prepared to use force
and those who were not would come best from TB not him … He said we have to
come to a conclusion at the UN. If we issue an ultimatum and the prospect of force,
and France says no, it becomes impossible.
“TB said he still thought Chirac might say yes, but with a delay.
“Bush said that if he went for yes with twenty-one days, he would reject it. They are
the ones being unreasonable, not us.
“TB said he would definitely lose … RC [Robin Cook] …
“TB said he was not sure where Kofi [Annan] was.
“Bush said he had totally different problems to us re the UN … the pressure in the
States was to bury it. Then ‘I told Fox he has seriously messed up. He has really let
me down on this.’ …”217
635.  Mr Brenton reported that President Bush was determined to remove Saddam
Hussein and to stick to the US timetable for action.
636.  The UK’s “steadfastness” had been “invaluable” in bringing in other
countries in support of action. Helping Mr Blair to make the transition from the
UN process to military action was in the US’s own interests.

to Iraq. Hutchinson, 2012.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

637.  Advising on the perspective from Washington, Mr Brenton reported that President
Bush was:
“… utterly determined to get Saddam out. In retrospect it looks as if he finally and
firmly reached that conclusion in early December at the time of the false Iraqi
declaration. The entire subsequent action has been driven by it. This is a President
who sets targets and expects his subordinates to deliver. Hence the ironclad
determination of the timetable (which has hardly budged in three months) and the
occasionally visible uneasiness about focusing exclusively on disarmament and
sticking to the UN route (in case we got the answer ‘yes’). This does not mean that
Bush wants to go to war, but the bottom line is that Saddam must go.”218
638.  Mr Brenton added that President Bush “had every reason to feel confident” about
military action:
“The chief current nightmare in the Pentagon and intelligence community is
‘catastrophic success’ – a collapse of resistance in Iraq which moves too fast for us
instantly to establish order in its wake. Of course nothing is certain and there are
downside scenarios … But the high probability projection is for a quick and relatively
clean victory.
“As you know, the US are ready to start the (short) countdown to military action
next week.”
639.  President Bush also had domestic political grounds for confidence as the
conviction that war is inevitable “had taken hold”. Liberal politicians had “kept their heads
down”, and conservative commentators had “grown increasingly impatient with the
UN’s delays”.
640.  Mr Brenton wrote that the US Administration had, however, “been shocked” at their
“inability” to get Turkey on board and the “failure, despite what they see as vigorous
arm twisting, to get a majority for a second … resolution”. The State Department was
“concerned at images of US unilateralism” and was:
“… working hard at giving the ‘coalition’ of supportive countries a more visible
presence. In this optic, the steadfastness of UK support, bringing with it other
key players … had been invaluable to them. The President is thus concerned
about the Prime Minister’s present political difficulties not only out of fellow feeling
(… a genuinely significant factor …) but also out of self interest. It would be
massively damaging for US interests for the British Government to fall because of
our support in Iraq. The US will go to great lengths to help it not happen (as indeed
they have started to do with their announcement on the Road Map).”

218 

Telegram 350 Washington to FCO London, 15 March 2003, ‘Iraq’.

509

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

641.  Mr Brenton concluded:
“At the Azores Summit … Bush will be looking for a way of making the transition
from the UN process to the military countdown in a manner maximally helpful to the
Prime Minister. A key component of this will be the announcement of our intentions
for a post-Saddam Iraq, and in particular the level of UN involvement in administering.
[…] and there is a clear US red line on fighting to liberate Iraq and then handing
the governance over to the UN. Extensive UN involvement short of this ought to
be achievable, and is a prize worth fighting for.”
642.  Mr Blair saw the telegram on the way to the Azores Summit.
643.  Mr Sherard Cowper-Coles, the British Ambassador to Israel, subsequently
reported that there were some suggestions that the announcement of the Road Map
had been a gesture to help Mr Blair; and that “as such it should not be taken too
seriously by Israel”.219
MR BLAIR’S CONTACTS WITH OTHER LEADERS
644.  Mr Blair contacted a number of leaders to prepare the ground for the
announcement that the UK would be taking no further action on the draft
resolution.
645.  Mr Rycroft recorded that in the conversation with Mr John Howard, the Australian
Prime Minister, on 15 March, Mr Howard asked “if the diplomatic process was dead”.220
Mr Blair replied that it had “reached an impasse. The process would struggle on until
Monday. Even the Russian position was making things difficult.”
646.  Mr Blair added that “a way forward could have been found” if everyone had
supported the proposals tabled by the UK the previous week; the “US had not been
eager about the proposals, but they were prepared to go along with them. The tests
had been taken from the Inspectors’ own reports – they were perfectly reasonable.”
Saddam Hussein was “now busy hiding material around Iraq”.
647.  Mr Blair and Mr Howard also discussed the effect of the French veto which
the “elected six”’ were “hiding behind”. The implication would be that the US, UK and
Australian troops should stay in the region indefinitely; without forces in the region the
inspectors would be “kicked out”. If it was clear the diplomatic process was not going
to proceed, there was little point in putting the resolution to a vote.
648.  Mr Blair and Mr Howard also discussed the role of the UN and international
financial institutions after conflict and the importance of a Road Map for the MEPP.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

649.  In response to a letter from Mr Atal Vajpayee, the Prime Minister of India,
proposing a summit-level meeting of the leaders of the five Permanent Members of
the Security Council about the situation in Iraq, Mr Blair wrote:
“… the current situation in Iraq poses many challenges for the international
community. How we handle this issue will have wide-ranging global implications
for many years to come. It is for this reason that we and other UNSC members are
working so hard to secure a peaceful resolution.
“I am conscious that all P5 members have a duty to do everything within their power
to resolve this issue without eroding the authority of the UN system. I am meeting
my US and Spanish counterparts on 16 March in the hope that a way can be found
to bridge the differences within the Security Council. I hope that the UK and India will
keep in very close touch as the situation develops.”221
650.  In a discussion with President Lagos about the Chilean proposal, the position of
the “elected six” and the position of the US and other members of the Security Council,
Mr Blair said that there were concerns that the “elected six” document would be “used
by the French to cause further delay”.222 Time was running out. It was clear from his
conversation with President Chirac the previous day that France “would still not accept
the automatic use of force or an ultimatum in the event of non-compliance”.
651.  President Lagos stated that benchmarks without a timeline would result in
endless discussion, but it was not clear what the Security Council could do and time was
running out. Secretary Powell had told the Mexican Foreign Minister that the US did not
want any further movement at the UN.
652.  President Lagos was reported to have stated that he:
“… had acted in good faith, but he would not do anything further. He was very mad
with the US response. They had assumed motives that were not true.”
653.  Mr Blair said he would have further discussions with the US and “there could be
a chance to squeeze things through”; and that “he thought there was still time and he
would keep trying until the last minute”.
654.  President Lagos responded that Mr Blair “knew where Chile stood and he was
sorry that they had not been able to achieve a successful outcome last week”.
655.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that the six tests tabled by the UK on 12 March:
“… were immediately rejected by France. Jacques Chirac gave a very strong
statement saying he would not support military action whatever the circumstances.
Dominique de Villepin … also then rejected the tests per se. This was before

the Iraqis even responded. Ricardo [Lagos] then explained that, in this case, he
couldn’t really participate in an obviously futile charade at the UNSC. The UN route
was blocked.”223
656.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:
“… the strength of the French statements of opposition and his internal politics made
President Lagos say, reasonably enough, that he could not support what was going
to be not only a resolution doomed to a veto, but one strongly attacked by certain
P5 members.”224
TRIPARTITE DECLARATION, 15 MARCH 2003
657.  In a declaration on 15 March, France, with Germany and Russia, attempted
to secure support in the Security Council for continued inspections.
658.  In a declaration late on 15 March, France, Germany and Russia appealed to
Security Council members to “make every effort to ensure” that a peaceful approach
prevailed to meet the shared goal of the international community for the disarmament
of Iraq.225 The points made in the declaration included:

•	
•	

The inspections regime in resolution 1441 was “unprecedented”.

•	

The “successive reports” to the Security Council by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had
shown that inspections were “producing results” and that disarmament of Iraq
had begun. There was “every reason to believe that it can be completed rapidly
and in accordance with the rules set out by the Council. Iraq, for its part, must
co-operate actively and unconditionally.”

•	
•	
•	
•	

A reaffirmation that “nothing in current circumstances justifies abandoning the
inspections process or resorting to force”.

“France, Russia and Germany, supported by China” had “submitted proposals”
to achieve disarmament “by defining key disarmament tasks and establishing
a rigorous timetable”.
“Suggestions in the same spirit” had “been put forward by other members of
the Council”.
The unity of the Security Council could be preserved, and all members bore
“a particular responsibility for ensuring” it was “not divided at this crucial time”.
When UNMOVIC’s work programme was submitted to the Security Council, the
Council should meet “immediately thereafter at the ministerial level to approve
key disarmament tasks and establish an implementation timetable” which was
“both demanding and realistic”.

The use of force could only be “a last resort”.
A “peaceful approach” was “supported by the immense majority of the
international community”.

659.  President Chirac’s interview with CNN, which was broadcast on 16 March, is
addressed later in this Section.
MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS, 16 MARCH 2003
660.  Mr Blair and other Ministers continued on 16 March to insist that there was
still time for a peaceful solution. They also drew attention to difficulties created
by President Chirac’s stance on a veto and dismissed the tripartite proposal to
extend the inspections process.
661.  In his interview on the BBC’s Breakfast with Frost programme on 16 March,
Mr Brown focused on the Government’s wish to avoid military action.226 He stated
that “obviously we don’t want war, we want peace, we want the diplomatic process to
work”. The UK was not seeking military action: “Even now … Saddam Hussein could
announce that he would comply and he would co-operate …” The “purpose of the
second resolution was to put the maximum pressure on Saddam Hussein … that he
had to disarm immediately and that he could not get off the hook”.
662.  Mr Brown stated:
“My view … and I think this is the view of Tony Blair, is that we should continue to
try, even now, even in these difficult times, to secure international agreement … to a
resolution that would involve international co-operation and force Saddam Hussein
to disarm. It is unfortunate that we have both got non-compliance on the part
of Iraq …
“And of course the other issue that makes it difficult is that at least one country has
said that although it has supported the resolutions that imply the use of force, that
they would not support a resolution now on the use of force, at this stage, whatever
the circumstances …
“… even today the focus is on seeing if we can move the diplomatic process
forward … even at this stage there are initiatives that can be taken that would move
it forward. I would like every one of the Security Council members to be in a position
to say that they would support the disarmament of Saddam Hussein.”
663.  Mr Brown added:
“This is about our national interests, this is our role in the international community.
Tony Blair has tried to bring Europe and America together. He’s trying to find a

Exchequer.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

diplomatic way forward … I believe there are options still available to us and these
will be discussed today with President Bush … the important thing to recognise is
that when the international community passes its resolutions … it has got to show
that it’s got a mechanism for enforcing its will. And that was, of course, the purpose
of the second resolution, but … that could form initiatives that could be taken this
afternoon and later, to see if we can resolve this issue without military action.
“… Even now there are initiatives on the table that have been put forward by us and
others that may help us resolve the question of whether there can be international
co-operation but the blockage is the non-compliance of Saddam Hussein and … at
least one country saying … in what I think is unreasonable terms, that whatever the
circumstances … they would not consider the use of force. And that really deprives
us of a mechanism for action …”
664.  Mr Brown also stated that the Government would not be acting in the way it was
“unless it was satisfied that there was a legal basis for its actions”.
665.  In his diaries, Mr Campbell described a “long meeting” in Sir David Manning’s
office before leaving for the Azores, with Sir David, Baroness Morgan and Mr Rycroft,
who were joined by Mr Brown, Dr John Reid, Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party
Chairman, and Ms Armstrong.227
666.  The meeting had tried:
“… to boil down the central arguments and dividing lines now. I suggested we say we
intend to go back to the French and test their position – do they support any element
of what we are saying? Are they really saying there are no circumstances in which
they would support anything seen as a threat of military action. If they are, we go.
If not, we have to look again.
“David M said there was no indication the French intended to shift.
“GB did Frost and came back saying the really tough questions were in the field
of legality. GB also said if we are saying this is the final shot at diplomacy, what
are we actually saying we are going to do after today? Bush didn’t want a process
story but I suggested one, namely a last round of contacts at the UN post the
Azores meeting.”
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRIME MINISTER BALKENENDE
667.  Mr Rycroft recorded that in a conversation with Mr Jan Peter Balkenende,
Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Blair had said, in reply to a question about

whether Mr de Villepin and President Chirac’s recent telephone calls signalled a
“willingness to be more co-operative”, that France:
“… would still not accept a resolution that contained an ultimatum or the
automatic use of force. They were only prepared to look at timing and benchmarks.
An impasse had been reached.”228
668.  Subsequently, Mr Blair stated that:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

“… the UN track was now quite difficult. The ‘elected six’ had been close
to agreement last week but were frightened off by pressure from Russia
and France.”
There was a “slim chance” of a majority in favour of a second resolution, “but
only with a big push”: “The problem was that once it became clear … France
was going to veto the elected six saw little point in putting the resolution to the
vote.”
The ideas put forward by Mr de Villepin were “yet another way of creating further
delays. The process was going round in circles.”
“… France, Germany and Russia had made an agreement that they would
act together. Russia would not countenance anything other than a peaceful
solution … France and Russia were prepared to veto a resolution containing
an ultimatum or the automatic use of force.”
“China was one step removed … they would not use their veto.”
“… French and Russian statements that disarmament was happening went
against reality. Had the international community presented Saddam with a strong
ultimatum then he would probably have complied.”
At the Azores Summit “they would try to give the UN one last chance”.
“… it had to be made clear – compliance or military action would follow”.

MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH MR ANNAN, 16 MARCH 2003
669.  Mr Blair told Mr Annan, who wanted to explore the scope for compromise
before the Azores Summit, that an impasse had been reached with France, and
Saddam Hussein would comply only if there was a clear threat of force.
670.  Ms Short spoke to Mr Annan on 15 March. She recorded that he had:
“… said he had talked to every member of the Security Council and governments
across the world were ringing him saying surely one more effort at compromise was
possible … all agree time too short and should not be automatic trigger to war.”229

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

671.  Ms Short also recorded that she had subsequently spoken to both Mr Brown
and Mr Blair. She had told Mr Brown, who “kept on about French” that he should
speak to Mr Annan. In response to a request for her view on announcing a UN lead on
reconstruction in the Azores, she told Mr Blair that if war was inevitable that was all he
had got. Mr Blair had said he would “still be open to other possibilities”.
672.  The FCO suggested that Mr Blair should talk to Mr Annan from the Azores with key
messages including:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Exploring the scope for any remaining diplomacy (if relevant), including the
possibility of a final ultimatum to Saddam Hussein as the last window for a
peaceful solution.
Discouraging any further visits to Baghdad (as suggested by Iraq – see Box
below), “whose only purpose would be to buy more time”.
Looking forward to the UN having “a significant role after any conflict in helping
Iraq move quickly towards new prosperity and stability”.
Hoping that Mr Annan could “work to improve the atmosphere in the Council
and keeping the UN steady”.230

Iraqi actions
Iraq also sought to deflect military action.
Dr Blix wrote that a letter from Dr al-Sa’adi, Scientific Adviser to the Iraq Presidency
who represented Iraq in its negotiations with the UN, inviting Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to
visit Baghdad to try to accelerate the inspections process and take note of the progress
achieved, was received on 15 March.231
Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had earlier concluded that any visit would need to be
preceded by a declaration from Saddam Hussein and that they would come to
discuss its implementation. Dr Blix informed Mr Annan, Ambassador Negroponte and
Sir Jeremy Greenstock.
Dr Blix wrote that:

•	

Sir Jeremy responded quickly; the UK Foreign Office urged caution. The bars for
a visit should be set high with the need not only for a declaration but also some
“down payment”.

•	
•	

Ambassador Negroponte “discouraged” a visit.
Mr Annan advised that Dr al-Sa’adi should be asked to clarify more precisely what he
thought could be attained; and that the President of the Council should be informed.

On 16 March, Saddam Hussein was reported to have said that Iraq used to have weapons
of mass destruction to defend itself against Iran and Israel, and that when he (Saddam)
said he had no weapons “he means what he says”.232

673.  Mr Blair spoke to Mr Annan, who wanted to explore the scope for compromise,
before the Azores Summit.233
674.  Mr Blair reiterated his comment that an impasse had been reached:
“There was no point in passing a resolution, which was not backed by force because
Saddam would just ignore it. France had also rejected the tests Britain had put
forward last week. The problem with the latest French proposal was that after
allowing a further month of inspections, there would be yet another discussion and
we would be back to where we started. Clear tests were needed … but the French
would not accept that. It was very difficult to see a way through.”
675.  Mr Blair added that: “Saddam would only comply if there was a clear threat of force.”
676.  Mr Blair and Mr Annan also discussed the importance of a strong UN role in
post‑conflict Iraq, the need for a relationship between the UN and “whoever was
occupying Iraq” and a resolution establishing the relationship between the occupying
force and occupied Iraq.
THE AZORES SUMMIT, 16 MARCH 2003
677.  At the Azores Summit it was agreed that unless there was a fundamental
change in the next 24 hours, the UN process would end.
678.  In public the focus was on a “last chance for peace”. The joint communiqué
contained a final appeal to Saddam Hussein to comply with his obligations and
to the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.
679.  When President Bush, Mr Blair, Mr Aznar and Mr Barroso met in the Azores,
Mr Blair stated that the meeting:
“… had to send a message that this was the final appeal to Saddam to comply, and
to the Security Council to back a second resolution containing an ultimatum.”234
680.  They also discussed:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
233 
234 

The need to avoid an alternative resolution which might secure enough support
to delay action.
The likelihood that the invasion would be welcomed but the risk that there would
be communal violence.
The role the UN should play, including that it would not be able to deal with
communal violence. That would need to be “handled rapidly by the military”.
The importance of pushing the peace process in the Middle East.
The document on transatlantic security which they would issue.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

681.  Mr Blair said that:
“The point of decision had arrived. It had been an agonising process going through
the UN. But the justification had been that we had to look at every alternative before
turning to military action. We should now be prepared to explain that continued
non-compliance by Saddam Hussein could not be met by another discussion.
We had made every effort … We had to explain yet again that unless there
was effective pressure on Saddam, he would never comply. Yet the French and
Russians made it impossible to bring that pressure to bear. We should now engage
in a last round of final contacts, and appeal to the Security Council to take its
responsibilities seriously.”
682.  Mr Blair added there was “24 hours to assess whether there had been a
fundamental change … If not … we should be ready for military action”. He would be
content to ask Sir Jeremy Greenstock to take the draft resolution off the table “tomorrow
morning ‘if there had been no lightning strike’. He would do so on behalf of the
three co‑sponsors.”
683.  Mr Blair stated that the role of the UN in post-conflict Iraq must be defined
very carefully:
“We must give the impression that the administration was under UN authority.
The clearer the UN role, the better. It was vital that UK public opinion understood
that we were not taking possession of Iraq’s oil.”
684.  Mr Blair also stated that the UN should be seen to give overall authorisation but it
could certainly not run everything. He wanted the UN Security Council to remain seized
of the Iraqi issue.
685.  The record of the discussion was to be seen by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and their
Principal Private Secretaries.
686.  Mr Campbell wrote:

•	

“Bush talked about it being a last effort. But he said it was important the world
saw we were making every effort to enforce 1441. He said everyone had to
be able to say we did everything we could to avoid war. But this was the final
moment, the moment of truth, which was the line most of the media ran with.
He stressed he wanted the UN to play an important role in the post-Saddam
era. He was clear we had to emphasise Iraq’s territorial integrity. He was
emphasising he really would move on MEPP. He said again TB had been right to
push him on the Road Map, and said he intended to spend a lot of time on this.
He said re Chirac ‘I don’t want to provoke him into unreasonableness.’ He was
however keen to say he wanted the UN properly involved in the post-Saddam
era …”

“TB said we had reached the point of decision for people. We had been there
before but there really had to be a decision. How many times could there be
a last chance, serious consequences for material breach? He reported that
Kofi [Annan] had said the French and Russians would not rule out force but
would not agree to an ultimatum, which was an odd position. He really hit the
UN buttons post-Saddam, and was trying to force Bush to go further on that.
‘It has to be a UN-authorised government.’ He was also hammering home the
advantages on MEPP, but I wasn’t convinced it would happen.”
“We needed some kind of process story so I suggested to TB they all instruct
their ambassadors at the UN to have one last go, see if the position of the others
had changed.”
“TB was constantly emphasising final appeal, final opportunity.”
“Bush was scathing re the Turks … He was pretty keen to get on with things
now, wanted to pull down the SCR now. He then said he would address the
American people tomorrow – say diplomacy had failed, issue the ultimatum.
He said to TB we should say we were issuing one last set of instructions to UN
ambassadors to have a go at securing agreement.”
“Aznar was really pushing the importance of the transatlantic alliance, but he
was in even more political hot water on this than we were.”235

687.  The ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’, issued at the Summit, and outlining the
challenge Saddam Hussein posed to the world, stated:

•	

•	

•	

“Iraq’s talented people, rich culture, and tremendous potential had been
hijacked by Saddam Hussein”, whose “brutal regime had reduced” Iraq “to an
international pariah” that oppressed “its citizens, started two wars of aggression
against its neighbours” and still posed “a grave threat to the security of the
region and the world”.
“Saddam’s defiance” of Security Council resolutions demanding disarmament
had “undermined the authority of the UN”. The international community had
“tried to persuade him to disarm and thereby avoid military conflict, most recently
through the unanimous adoption of resolution 1441”. If he refused “even now to
co-operate fully” with the UN, he brought “on himself the serious consequences
foreseen in resolution 1441 and previous resolutions”.
“In these circumstances, we would undertake a solemn obligation to help the
Iraqi people build a new Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbours. The Iraqi
people deserve to be lifted from insecurity and tyranny, and freed to determine
for themselves the future of their country. We envisage a unified Iraq with its
territorial integrity respected. All the Iraqi people – its rich mix … should enjoy
freedom, prosperity, and equality in a united country. We will support the Iraqi

people’s aspirations for a representative government that upholds human rights
and the rule of law as cornerstones of democracy.”
“We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein’s regime to the
natural resources of Iraq and pledge to protect them as a national asset of and
for the Iraqi people. All Iraqis should share the wealth generated by their national
economy. We will seek a swift end to international sanctions, and support an
international reconstruction program …”
“We will fight terrorism in all its forms. Iraq must never again be a haven for
terrorists any kind.”
“In achieving this vision, we plan to work in close partnership with international
institutions, including the UN; our Allies and partners; and bilateral donors.”
“If conflict occurs we plan to seek … new … resolutions that would affirm Iraq’s
territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, and endorse an
appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq. We will also propose that the
Secretary-General be given authority’, on an interim basis, to ensure that the
humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met through the Oil-forFood program.”
“Any military presence, should it be necessary, will be temporary and intended
to promote security and elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the delivery
of humanitarian aid; and the conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq. Our
commitment to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term.”
“We call upon the international community to join with us in helping to realize
a better future for the Iraqi peopIe.”236

Azores communiqué on Transatlantic Solidarity
The communiqué on transatlantic solidarity stated that:

•	

The Summit had been held “at a time of great challenge”; and that the four leaders
faced “painful choices”.

•	

They had reaffirmed their “commitment to our core values and the Transatlantic
Alliance”, which rested on “a common commitment to democracy, freedom and the
rule of law”. They were “bound by a solemn commitment to defend one another”;
and they would “face and overcome together the twin threats of the 21st century:
terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction”.

•	
•	
•	

Security was “tied to peace and security throughout the world”.
They were “working together to bring security to Afghanistan”.
They had affirmed “a vision of a Middle East peace in which two states, Israel
and Palestine, will live side by side in peace, security, and freedom”; and they
welcomed “the fact that the Road Map designed to implement this vision will soon
be delivered …”

•	

They urged “friends and allies to put aside differences, and work together for
peace, freedom and security”. The “friendship and solidarity between Europe and
the United States” was “strong” and would “continue to grow in years to come”.237

688.  In the press conference following the Summit, President Bush said that the
following day would be the “moment of truth for the world”.238 Nations had “voiced a
commitment to peace and security” and now needed to demonstrate that “in the only
effective way, by supporting the immediate and unconditional disarmament of Iraq”.
689.  In response to questions, President Bush added:

•	
•	

Saddam Hussein could “leave the country if he’s interested in peace … the
decision is his to make”.
His speech of 12 September 2002 had “called the UN into account” because
he understood the “wars of the 21st century” were “going to require incredible
international co-operation”. He hoped that the following day the UN would
“do its job”.

690.  Mr Blair emphasised the “key point” was “our responsibility to uphold the will of the
United Nations set out in resolution 1441”, which had provided the final opportunity for
Saddam Hussein to disarm and for “serious consequences” to follow if he failed to do so.
691.  In an oblique reference to France, Mr Blair stated that there was an “impasse”
where “some say there should be no ultimatum, no authorisation of force in any new
resolution”. He added:
“… without a credible ultimatum authorising force in the event of non-compliance,
then more discussion is just more delay, with Saddam remaining armed with
weapons of mass destruction …”
692.  Mr Blair warned that Saddam Hussein was still playing “a game he has played over
the last 12 years” and:
“Disarmament never happens … instead the international community is drawn
into some perpetual negotiation … but never real and concrete progress leading
to disarmament.”
693.  Mr Blair stated that “Nobody” was prepared to say there was “full co-operation”
and drew attention to the absence of interviews outside Iraq and Iraq’s failure to
provide evidence of the destruction of 10,000 litres of anthrax as the reason why the

international community needed to give a “strong and unified message” that the “games
had to stop”. The UK would do all it could:
“… in the short time that remains to make a final round of contacts to see if there
is a way through this impasse. But … now is the time when we have to decide.”
694.  In response to a question, Mr Blair added:
“So when people say we haven’t exhausted all the diplomatic avenues, we tried …
But … from our perspective and from the perspective of the security of the world, we
cannot simply go back to the Security Council, for this discussion to be superseded
by another discussion. That’s what happened for 12 years …”
695.  Dr Blix wrote that it seemed to him that there was a difference in tone between
President Bush and Mr Blair.239 The former had talked about “what a bright future Iraq
would have if Saddam was taken out”. Mr Blair had talked about “going the last mile
for peace and the need for the UN to stop a proliferator”. Dr Blix wrote: “Perhaps Blair
still had some hope that Saddam would crack … if he was faced with a unanimous
Council resolution.”
696.  Dr Blix recorded that Sir Jeremy Greenstock had “ventured” that the Azores
Summit was “about peace rather than about war”; but that the declaration seemed to
him to be “more belligerent than peaceful”. Dr Blix commented that:
“… the statement from the one-hour meeting was at this late stage perhaps less
of an ultimatum to Saddam than one to the members of the Security Council – to
support the resolution or be bypassed. The game was over … later that Sunday
afternoon I got the call from … Washington saying that it was time to withdraw our
inspectors from Iraq.”
697.  In his memoir, President Bush described the meeting as a “last-minute summit on
diplomatic strategy” where they had “all agreed the diplomatic track had reached its end.
We planned to withdraw the second resolution Monday morning.”240
698.  President Bush wrote:
“I was deeply disappointed that diplomacy had failed but I had promised the
American people, our allies and the world that we would enforce the UN resolutions.
I was not going to break my word.
“For months I had solicited advice … Some believed we could contain Iraq by
keeping the inspectors in Iraq. But I didn’t see how. If we were to tell Saddam he
had another chance – after declaring this was his last chance – we would shatter
our credibility and embolden him.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

“Others suggested that the threat wasn’t as serious as we thought … we had a
warning like a blaring siren. Years of intelligence pointed overwhelmingly to the
conclusion that Saddam had WMD. He had used them in the past. He had not met
his responsibility to prove their destruction. He had refused to co-operate with the
inspectors … The only logical conclusion was that he was hiding WMD. And given
his support of terror and his sworn hatred of America, there was no way to know
where those weapons would end up.
“Others alleged that America’s real intent was to control Iraq’s oil and satisfy Israel.
Those theories were false. I was sending our troops into combat to protect the
American people.
“I knew the cost would be high, but inaction had a cost, too. Given everything we
knew, allowing Saddam to remain in power would have amounted to an enormous
gamble. I would have had to bet that every major intelligence agency was wrong or
that Saddam would have a change of heart. After seeing the horror of 9/11, that was
not a chance I was willing to take. Military action was my last resort. But I believed
it was necessary.”241
699.  Mr Blair described the Summit in his memoir as a:
“… slightly surreal event. On the face of it we were still pushing for a political
solution. There were some last minute hopes of an Arab initiative to get Saddam
out; or of a Saddam capitulation. George was content to adopt the line that we were
going to hold out every last hope for peace …
“We rehearsed again the main arguments. He was completely calm. He thought
we had to send out a message of total clarity to the world: have anything to do with
WMD and we are going to come after you. More even than me, he was focused on
the possibility of terrorist groups getting hold of WMD material: ‘I am just not going
to be the president on whose watch it happens’ …”242
700.  Mr Blair concluded:
“So when I look back … I know there was never any way Britain was not going to
be with the US at that moment, once we went down the UN route and Saddam was
in breach. Of course such a statement is always subject to in extremis correction.
A crazy act of aggression? No, we would not have supported that. But given the
history, you couldn’t call Saddam a crazy target.
“Personally I have little doubt that at some point we would have to have dealt with
him. But throughout I comforted myself, as I put it in the Glasgow speech, that if we
were wrong, we would have removed a tyrant; and as a matter of general principle,
I was in favour of doing that.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Nonetheless, I was also aware that the very split in international opinion meant that
we were absolutely at the mercy of events … So as we left the Azores, I knew the
die was cast. I was aware of my isolation … my total dependence on things going
right not wrong … What’s more this was the first time I would be committing troops
to an action to topple a regime where we would be the junior partner, where we
would not be in charge of the arrangements …
“… I was calm … I was doing what I thought was right. But … I wished I wasn’t
doing it.”
701.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that, on the way to the Azores, Mr Blair was “still
angry at the way the US had handled it” and that he had said: “If we had been totally in
charge of this, I am absolutely sure we could have won the French round.” Mr Campbell
“felt the US and France both, for different reasons did not want to meet on this”.243
702.  Commenting on the Summit, Mr Campbell wrote:
“Everyone kept going on about it being ‘the last effort for a political solution’.
But there was more than a slight feeling of going through the motions.”
703.  Mr Campbell also wrote that Mr Blair “was still saying it was the right thing to do”
and that he “had lost count of how many times” he “had heard those same words”.
PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S INTERVIEW WITH CNN, 16 MARCH 2003
704.  In an interview broadcast on CNN on 16 March, during the Azores Summit,
President Chirac said that he hoped the Summit would recognise that inspections
provided an effective system “to achieve our common goal … the disarmament of Iraq,
elimination and destruction of her weapons of mass destruction”.244
705.  Asked about his bottom line for a compromise, President Chirac replied that was
a matter for the inspectors. In his view, the Security Council had unanimously:
“… decided to disarm Iraq peacefully through inspections for as long as the
inspectors consider this possible.”
“We see today … that a lot of progress has been achieved … admittedly we haven’t
reached the goal, but the inspectors consider … that we have the possibility of
reaching our goal without waging war. That is the goal I am seeking. I am totally
ready to accept all the practical arrangements that the inspectors will suggest …”

706.  Asked if he would be prepared to accept a 30- or 60-day deadline, President
Chirac stated that the inspectors’ advice must be accepted:
“We have given them a mission and we have a moral and political obligation to
accept their advice or else explain why we are not following it. But if we don’t follow
their advice, then only the Security Council can decide not to.”
707.  President Chirac added that it was in that spirit that France, Germany and Russia,
“supported today by China”, had proposed a Ministerial meeting of the Security Council
to discuss the inspectors’ proposed work programme.
708.  President Chirac accepted that US and British military pressure had achieved
a shift in Iraq’s position, adding that he considered:
“… the Americans have already won … without firing a shot… we should be thankful
to them for exercising that effective pressure. But that doesn’t mean that we have
to wage war if it isn’t necessary. And today, I don’t think it’s necessary.”
709.  Asked if it would have sent a stronger signal if France had also sent troops,
President Chirac replied that “from the very beginning” France felt that the process
of resolution 1441 “didn’t embrace the possibility of war”. That was why France was
“refusing today, and I mean today, the prospect of war”. If the strategy (of inspections)
failed, France would “refuse no solution, including war”.
710.  Asked if his repeated vow to veto had strengthened and emboldened Saddam
Hussein, President Chirac replied:
“I don’t think so at all and, in any case, it isn’t a relevant problem today … there isn’t
a majority on the Security Council for war …”
711.  Asked if he believed Iraq had chemical or biological weapons, President Chirac
replied: “I don’t know … we have no proof”, but that was the task for the inspectors.
712.  Asked in conclusion again why France hadn’t sent troops to exert pressure on
Saddam Hussein, President Chirac replied that the US on its own was “exerting all the
pressure”; the British were “just making an additional contribution”. He wanted to “limit
the risks of war as far as possible”. He was “not a pacifist”, but “simply saying that war
is the last resort when everything else has been done. And we are not in that situation.”
713.  Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair said: “It was clear now … that the French did not
intend to move.”245
714.  Mr Campbell also wrote that the briefing to the press on the aircraft on the way
back from the Azores made “clear that the French had to come back and say whether
there were any circumstances at all in which they might support military action”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

The end of activity on the second resolution
715.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had agreed with his US and Spanish
colleagues to tell the press “late the following morning” that there was no
prospect of putting the resolution to a vote, and blaming France.
716.  After the Azores Summit, Sir David Manning spoke to Sir Jeremy Greenstock to
ask him to phone his Security Council colleagues that evening to establish whether there
had been any change in their positions on the draft resolution.246
717.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock subsequently reported that the UK Mission in New York
had spoken to all Security Council colleagues with the message that:
“… there was now a short time left to consider whether the Council could agree at
last on an ultimatum to Saddam which, if he did not fulfil it, would result in serious
consequences. If their respective governments were in a position to engage in such
a discussion, I would need to hear it as early as possible on 17 March. When asked
(as the majority did), I said that I had no (no) instructions as to whether to put the
text … to a vote …”247
718.  Sir Jeremy commented that the French and Russians did not like the message.
Mr de La Sablière had claimed that the French had moved significantly over the last two
days as President Chirac’s interview would show. The “undecided 6” were “only slightly
more positive”.
719.  Sir Jeremy also reported that he had agreed with his American and Spanish
counterparts to tell the press during the “late morning” of 17 March that there was
“no prospect of putting our resolution to the vote, casting heavy blame on the French”.
The key elements of the statement should be:
“(a)	 the Azores Summit had called for a last effort to see if the Council could unite
around an ultimatum;
(b)	 having contacted every member it was clear that Council consensus was not
possible within the terms of 1441, given the determination of one country in
particular to block any ultimatum;
(c)	 we would therefore not be pursuing a vote;
(d)	 the Azores communiqué had made clear the positions of our governments
on the way forward.”
720.  Sir Jeremy informed Mr Annan and Dr Blix that he would be receiving final
instructions “eg on whether to stop pursuing the resolution on the morning [Eastern
Standard Time] of 17 March”.

721.  Sir Jeremy asked for instructions and comments on a draft statement, writing:
“I have assumed you will want to be fairly strong on the French.”
722.  Mr Campbell wrote that a meeting on 17 March between Mr Blair, Mr Prescott,
Mr Brown, Mr Straw, Dr Reid and Ms Armstrong had:
“… agreed Greenstock would put down the SCR at 10.15 New York time, that we
would say at the 11[am briefing for the media] there would be a Cabinet at 4, Jack’s
statement later and also that the Attorney General would publish his view that there
was a solid legal base for action. Jack would go through the motions of chatting to
his opposite numbers but basically the game was up.”248
723.  Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell at lunchtime to brief him on the timetable for
Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s announcement of the end of the diplomatic route, Cabinet
and his Parliamentary Statement.249 Mr Straw also informed Secretary Powell that
Lord Goldsmith had issued legal advice to the effect that a second resolution was not
necessary for military operations.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 17 MARCH 2003
724.  Mr Blair discussed his efforts to rally political support in the UK with President Bush
at 12.45pm on 17 March.250 The publication of the Road Map and the public airing of
the UN role post-conflict had had a positive effect. They also discussed the positions
of Dr Blix and other members of the Security Council.
725.  Mr Blair commented that: “It should not be forgotten how many times Saddam had
given the UN supposed full and final declarations of his WMD.” Keeping the UN “in play”
was “a high priority with British opinion”.
RUSSIA’S POSITION
726.  Sir Roderic Lyne reported that President Putin had stated earlier that day that
“a possible war in Iraq is a mistake fraught with the gravest consequences, which may
result in casualties and destabilise the international system in general”.251
727.  Mr Straw telephoned Mr Ivanov at lunchtime to confirm that he was anxious that
the UK and Russia should maintain good relations despite “current difficulties” and his
hope that:
“… even if military action appeared necessary, the UK and US could still make
good use of the UN, especially on post-conflict reconstruction and relief.”252

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

728.  The FCO reported that Mr Ivanov had stated that Russia wanted to continue
working under the aegis of the Security Council. The Council should discuss Dr Blix’s
report, which constituted a real action plan for Iraq’s disarmament, in its meeting on
19 March. He would attend that meeting. The Azores meeting represented the views
of only three states; it could not replace a Security Council meeting. No single country
had the right to stop the work of the weapons inspectors, whose authority came from
the UN. Recalling an assurance from Mr Blair to President Putin before the adoption
of resolution 1441 that it did not imply the automatic use of force, Mr Ivanov stated
that Russia’s main condition remained that the Security Council should vote on any
resolution sanctioning military action.
SIR JEREMY GREENSTOCK’S ANNOUNCEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003
729.  At “about 3.15pm UK time” on 17 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock announced
that the resolution would not be put to a vote, stating that the co-sponsors
reserved the right to take their own steps to secure the disarmament of Iraq.
730.  At “about 3.15pm UK time”,253 Sir Jeremy Greenstock made a statement
announcing that the UK, the US and Spain, as co-sponsors of the draft resolution,
would not be pursuing a vote on it.254
731.  Sir Jeremy stated:
“… we have worked very hard in the last few days in a final effort to seek a Council
consensus on Iraq. In an effort to reunite the Council the United Kingdom proposed
last week an ultimatum which would challenge Iraq to take a strategic decision
to disarm.
“There were three key elements to the compromise we proposed …
“Having held further discussions with Council Members over the weekend and in the
last few hours, we have had to conclude that Council consensus will not be possible
… One country in particular has underlined its intention to veto any ultimatum ‘no
matter what the circumstances’. That country rejected our proposed compromise
before even the Iraqi government itself and has put forward suggestions that would
row back on the unanimous agreement of the Council in 1441 – those suggestions
would amount to no ultimatum/no pressure/and no disarmament.
“The communiqués and press statements that issued at the Azores Summit explain
the positions of our governments … The co-sponsors reserve their right to take their
own steps to secure the disarmament of Iraq.”

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

732.  The subsequent discussion in the Council suggested that only the UK, the
US and Spain took the view that all options other than the use of military force
had been exhausted.
733.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “highlighted the particular role played by
France – without naming her – in making agreement impossible”. Mr de La Sablière
had said shortly afterwards that the French position reflected the majority view
in the Council.
734.  In the subsequent Council meeting, which Sir Jeremy Green stock described
as a “downbeat and rather surreal affair”, France Germany and Russia continued to
push for an open Council meeting at Ministerial level to consider and approve the work
programme for the inspectors.255
735.  Mr Lavrov said the statement by France, Russia and Germany on 15 March spoke
for itself: “Inspections were actively under way and yielding results.” He wanted to hear
more from Dr Blix about recent steps by Iraq “on substance”. The Council should meet
at Ministerial level on 18 or 19 March to consider the work programme. Russia “took a
different approach based on the concrete facts that disarmament was working”.
736.  Sir Jeremy reported that he had “regretted that it was not possible to find a way
forward on an ultimatum that would both put pressure on Iraq to take the strategic
decision to disarm and maintain inspections as the tool”; and stated that the UK:
“… reserved the right to take steps that would deliver disarmament. While the
prospects for peace were very slim, it was still possible even at this late hour
for Saddam to take a strategic decision and the actions that would prove such
a decision. In the circumstances, our national advice to UNMOVIC/IAEA and UN
staff was that it would be prudent to suspend inspections and for staff to withdraw
immediately … we remained interested in the 1284 work programme against the
background of the slim possibility of a strategic decision by Iraq.”
737.  Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte told the Council that, given
the threat of a veto, there had been no purpose in pursuing the resolution any further.
The US had warned UNMOVIC and the IAEA the previous evening that it would be
necessary to evacuate their personnel: “War was not imminent but it would not be
possible to give further notice.”
738.  Mr de La Sablière was reported to have told the Council that:
“At a time when inspections were making progress and peaceful disarmament in
a limited time seems possible his delegation had indeed made clear that it would
oppose a resolution authorising force. But it was not a veto when the co-sponsors
did not have a majority – it was a straight no. The situation was serious but we

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

should continue to work for even the slightest likelihood of a peaceful outcome …
the Council should consider and approve the work programme and key tasks …
It was up to the inspectors to set the timetable … if they said a month was necessary,
France could live with that. In accordance with 1441 the Council would then evaluate
the situation. Automaticity was difficult for the French, as for the majority, as it
allowed for the use of force without a Council decision. We should continue to work
for peaceful disarmament – the basis supported by the majority of the delegations
and of the world.”
739.  Sir Jeremy also reported:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

•	
•	
•	

Germany wanted the work programme to be discussed and approved: “As there
was not much difference between the UK proposal and the key tasks, it could,
even at this late hour, lead to consensus.”
Spain had “concurred” with Sir Jeremy’s intervention.
Syria had argued that there was another course which would have led to
peaceful disarmament and supported the Russian position.
China stated that if “withdrawing the resolution signalled a push for war, this
was very regrettable. Avoiding war was in the interest of all sides.”
Chile “continued to believe that inspections and the persistent threat of force
could have achieved peaceful disarmament”. It had made a proposal “along
the lines in the UK compromise and designed to bridge the gap between the
different parties”, but it had been “rejected within half an hour”.
Mexico stated that there was “no justification or implicit authorisation for the
use of force”.
Bulgaria was “open to any initiative that might restore unity”.
Angola stated that it had “always believed that all alternatives should be
exhausted before war. Unfortunately, this now appeared to be the case.”
If the proposed ministerial meeting “was just one more meeting we should let
things calm down first. If it could help to find a way forward, even at this late
hour, that was another matter.”
Cameroon appealed for dialogue, stating that the “failure to agree was a
disservice to multilateralism and the Council”. The draft Presidential statement
from the “undecided six” would have been “a platform for compromise”.
Guinea “hoped for a miracle”.
Pakistan said that members should “continue to explore all possible approaches
for a unified Council. The Council should accept the work programme and
continue to appeal for a positive response from Iraq, even at this late stage.”

530

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

740.  In the light of misunderstandings in the Council, Sir Jeremy explained that
the co‑sponsors:
“… were not withdrawing the resolution but, instead, not putting it to a vote.
The key to any chance for diplomacy lay in our being convinced that Iraq would
co‑operate within the terms of 1441. The Council had failed to find that key and
unlock the possibility of further inspections. On the authorisation for force …
I would be circulating the view our Attorney General had given earlier that day.”
741.  Dr Blix told the Council that the UNMOVIC draft programme identifying key
tasks would be available that afternoon, and that with a pro-active attitude it would
take Iraq “months” to complete.
742.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix had told the Council that:

•	
•	

•	
•	

UNMOVIC’s draft work programme would be available that afternoon.
It identified 12 key tasks. With a pro-active Iraqi attitude, all disarmament
tasks would take months to complete.
The UK had set out a smaller group of tasks and UNMOVIC would accept a time
set down by the Council and then report for it to judge compliance. Some issues
would take little time with Iraqi co-operation (eg interviews, missile destruction
and UAVs). But others – anthrax and mobile labs – were more difficult: it would
not take long to present materials if they existed, but it could take longer to prove
their non-existence.
While there had been pro-active Iraqi co-operation in recent days (including
further efforts to convince UNMOVIC that anthrax/VX had been destroyed and
footage of mobile sites), Dr Blix could not offer conclusions until he had a view
from his experts.
It was not clear whether the pro-active Iraqi co-operation covered all areas.256

743.  Mr Annan announced the withdrawal of the inspectors.
744.  Mr Annan told the Security Council that, following the US call to evacuate
personnel, he had decided to withdraw:

•	
•	
•	

all UN humanitarian personnel from Iraq, which could lead to the suspension
of the Oil-for-Food programme;
UNMOVIC and IAEA inspectors; and
troops and personnel in the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission (UNIKOM).257

745.  Sir Jeremy commented that delegations would be waiting for President Bush’s
speech, but the “danger of blow-back in the Security Council and General Assembly”

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

remained. He suggested that “it would be helpful to neutralise work programme
arguments – e.g. by pointing to a post-conflict UNMOVIC/IAEA disarmament role”.
746.  In a press conference after the meeting, Mr Annan announced that he was
withdrawing staff from Iraq following a warning from the US authorities the previous
day “that it would be prudent not to leave our staff in the region”.258 Mr Annan also
announced that several UN mandates, such as the Oil-for-Food programme, would be
suspended, but the UN would “find a way of resuming our humanitarian activities” and
to do “whatever we can to give them [the Iraqi population] assistance and support”.
Regardless of how the issue was resolved, the Security Council would have a role
to play in post-conflict Iraq.
747.  Mr Annan stated:
“I have made it very clear that in my judgement if the Council were to be able to
manage this process successfully and most of [sic] the collective will to handle
this operation, its own reputation and credibility would have been enhanced.
And I have also said if the action is to take place without the support of the Council,
its legitimacy will be questioned and the support for it will be diminished.”
748.  In response to questions, Mr Annan stated that war was “always a catastrophe”
and would lead to “major human tragedy”:
“… nobody wanted that and this was why we had hoped that the Iraqi leadership
would have co-operated fully and would have been able to do this [disarm] without
resort to the use of force. But the little window that we seem to have seems to be
closing very, very fast. I am not sure at this stage the Council can do anything in
the next couple of hours.”
749.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s proposal to cast “heavy blame on the French” for
the failure to reach agreement and his draft statement to the Security Council on
17 March were sent to No.10 and the FCO for clearance.
750.  The terms of Sir Jeremy’s statement about the position of France were almost
unchanged from the draft text he had sent to London earlier that day asking for
instructions and comments.259
751.  Sir Jeremy subsequently told the Inquiry that, in making his statement to the
Security Council on 17 March, casting blame on France, he “was acting under
instructions”.260 The “basic telegram” drafting his statement had gone “backwards and
forwards [between London and New York]”, but he had spoken to Mr Straw by telephone
on 16 March.

752.  Having been notified of this point, Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had:
“… had the record checked. No-one can find any telegram of instructions to
New York to say ‘Blame the French’. None exist.”261
753.  Mr Straw added that he spoke frequently to Sir Jeremy on the telephone but
Sir Jeremy did not “need instructions”.262 President Chirac’s intervention spoke
“for itself”; he had been “absolutely categorically saying” that, “the position of France
this evening is that we will vote no”. President Chirac’s statement had undermined
the UK’s efforts.
MR IVANOV’S STATEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003
754.  A statement issued on 17 March by Mr Ivanov said that:

262 

Russia had “firmly adhered” to an agreement made in a telephone call between
President Putin and President Bush on 6 September 2002, to “jointly seek the
unconditional return of inspectors to Iraq in accordance with UN Security Council
resolutions mandating Iraq’s disarmament”.
Russia had taken “a step towards Washington” by helping to pass
resolution 1441 unanimously, and sought Iraq’s “full co-operation and the
meeting of all demands” made by UNMOVIC and the IAEA.
Russia’s position, which was “shared by most members of the Security Council
and by other states, allowed the establishment of a reliable mechanism of
inspections that would be able to disarm Iraq”; and: “Because of this pressure
from the international community, disarmament is under way”.
In that context, “the idea of an imminent war against Iraq does not appear to
be valid”. It would involve “serious risks to all nations”. “In speaking out for a
political solution”, Russia was “striving not only to overcome this particular crisis
[Iraq] but also to push for continued joint efforts to solve other international
problems that are no less acute”.
The relationship between Russia and the US was “marked by growing mutual
trust and the spirit of co-operation”; including “an open and honest dialogue
over the most complex issues”. If Russia believed “that war against Iraq” would
“lead to harsh consequences”, it should “talk about it openly” with its partners
in Washington. Eliminating the threat of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction by
working with the US and other countries “and using political means” would be
“true partnership”.
“The value of partners and allies” was “not that they automatically agree with
one another but that they search together for solutions to solve problems in

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

common interests”. Striving for a political solution on Iraq was “in the best
interests” of Russia, the US and the rest of the world.263
755.  Separately, Sir Roderic Lyne reported that Mr Ivanov’s statement was:
“… claiming that Iraq ‘no longer presents a threat to international peace and
security’ and that ‘under these conditions, the use of force against Iraq, particularly
with references to the previous UNSC resolutions has absolutely no grounds,
including legal’.”264
756.  Mr Ivanov had stressed that resolution 1441 gave “no one the right to an automatic
use of force” and said that Russia wanted to ensure that the Security Council retained
control of the situation.
IMPACT OF THE US MILITARY TIMETABLE
757.  The US decision on the timing of military action determined the time
available for diplomatic negotiations.
758.  As the evidence in this and preceding Sections of the Report shows, the timetable
available for diplomatic negotiations on the second resolution was determined by
President Bush’s decisions on the timing of military action.
759.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock identified President Bush’s decision on the timing of
military preparations as the main factor leading to the end of the attempt to secure
a second resolution.265
760.  Sir Christopher Meyer, the British Ambassador to Washington from 1997
to February 2003, told the Inquiry that “when you looked at the timetable for the
inspections, it was impossible to see how Blix could bring the inspection process to
a conclusion for better or for worse by March”.266
761.  Sir Christopher added that had the effect of turning resolution 1441, which had
been a challenge to Saddam Hussein, “on its head”. The military timetable meant that
the UK found itself “scrabbling for the smoking gun” to prove that Saddam Hussein
was guilty.
762.  Mr Jonathan Powell told the Inquiry that, from January 2003, the UK had
repeatedly asked for, and been given, more time by President Bush; but by mid-March
“he wasn’t going to give us more time”.267

763.  Asked whether it was the need for the Armed Forces to move which set the
deadline, Mr Powell replied: “Yes”.268
764.  Asked whether the approaches from France following President Chirac’s
remarks had made clear that it was not closed to the idea of continuing the inspections
negotiation and, if this led to a particular result, voting for a resolution further down the
track, Sir Jeremy Greenstock replied:
“Yes, that’s probably true. But we knew by 10 March, because we had been talking
with the Americans all along about how much time we had for the benchmarks, that
we didn’t have time for that sort of escape route from what Chirac said.”269
765.  Asked about Mr Annan’s report on 12 March that President Chirac was not closed
to compromise, Sir Jeremy stated: “The Americans were closed to compromise.”
766.  Sir John Holmes told the Inquiry that the dialogue with France about a second
resolution had continued after President Chirac’s statement:
“… but … it was becoming increasingly clear that this was a game without meaning
at that point, because the military timetable was so close to fruition …”270
767.  If the matter had been left to the Security Council to decide, military action
might have been postponed.
768.  In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock said that, “[I]t would have
been in our interests to give the inspectors more time to find a smoking gun”, and
that the second resolution might have taken on a different shape or character on
a different timing.271
769.  Sir Jeremy thought it was “more than a 50 per cent chance that, if we had waited
until October, the inspectors would not have found a satisfactory solution and that
military force might well have been used at that point, the difference being the legitimacy
involved in giving the inspectors the greater time”.
770.  Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he believed “letting the inspections run
longer … would have been a useful thing to do”. He:
“… regretted that this process ended when it did, but … by this stage, the United
States was convinced these provisions were not working and it was also convinced
that a second resolution was impossible because of the political backdrop, not

least the suggestion that the French made that they would not approve any second
resolution, so I think you get into a situation where there is impatience in Washington
with the process and a determination to bring it to an end.”272
771.  Asked whether the suggestion by France and others to extend the period
of inspections was “for real” or “purely tactical to hold off the invasion”, Sir David
responded:
“I don’t know that I can be sure … there was an element of tactics and I think it is
important to recall how bad political relationships were at the top among different
governments at this time.
“One of the difficulties I felt … was the lack of communication between those
who were on different sides of the argument and I think there was undoubtedly
a tactical perception …
“I am not sure it was entirely tactical …”273
772.  Sir David Manning subsequently told the Inquiry:
“It became clear in January and February that it was very, very tough. This is a
period when relationships between leaders become very strained, and to a certain
extent just break down, to be honest.
“The French sort of go into overdrive against the idea of the second resolution in
February. The Americans tell us, well, we will get you the second resolution, we
know the Prime Minister needs one, and are, I think, considerably surprised when
they find actually they can’t deliver a second resolution.
“And I think the degree to which emotion and anger are affecting the argument at the
very top of Government during this period is very considerable.
“So it looked pretty bleak, to be honest. On the other hand, it seemed to me tempers
might cool. It would have been dramatically changed, the whole tempo of the crisis,
if Hans Blix had had a serious find, and initially it didn’t look impossible.”274
773.  Sir David added:
“… if over a series of months we didn’t find anything, then the mood would have
changed anyway, and whether we needed to get a second resolution or rethink the
whole crisis, at least you had a shot at that.”

774.  Asked if France would have been prepared to vote for a resolution authorising
force if the process had been pursued to the point where Dr Blix might have reported
that the process was exhausted, Mr Blair replied that in his judgement:
“… it was very, very clear … the French, the Germans and the Russians had
decided they weren’t going to be in favour of this and there was a straightforward
division … I don’t think it would have mattered how much time we had taken, they
weren’t going to agree that force should be used.”275
775.  Mr Blair added that, if the inspectors had uncovered something “absolutely
dramatic”, that “might have made a difference” to France’s position, but “there was by
then a political divide on this, of a pretty fundamental nature”.
776.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry:
“We never misrepresented the French view. The French view was perfectly clear.
It wasn’t that they were against any second resolution. They would perfectly happily
have agreed a second resolution provided it meant a third resolution and they would
have agreed a third resolution provided it meant a fourth one.
“What they were not prepared to do in any set of circumstances, never mind ce soir,
was that they were not prepared to agree to a resolution with an ultimatum.”276
777.  Mr Blair added that the UK was “caught” in a situation where the US was “quite
rightly” saying that what France was “prepared to agree” was “basically a rerun of 1441
except possibly weaker”; and that was “useless”.
778.  Mr Blair stated that President Chirac’s view was that inspections were working and
that was the route to deal with Saddam Hussein; “we should not deal with him by force,
whatever the circumstances”. President Chirac’s “point was not time”, “His point was if
it has an ultimatum in it, I don’t want it.”277 Mr Blair added: “Anything with an ultimatum,

The decision to take military action
779.  On the morning of Monday 17 March, preparations for Cabinet later that day
and Parliamentary debates the following day were put in place.
780.  Mr Straw wrote to Parliamentary colleagues drawing their attention to
the documents being published, the statements issued at the Azores Summit
the previous day, and an FCO paper assessing Iraq’s progress in meeting the
provisions of resolution 1441.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

781.  Lord Goldsmith replied on the morning of Monday 17 March to a Written Question
tabled by Baroness Ramsey of Cartvale (Labour):
“To ask Her Majesty’s Government what is the Attorney General’s view of the legal
basis for the use of force against Iraq.”278
782.  Mr Straw sent a copy of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to Mr Donald Anderson,
Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), on the morning of 17 March, together
with an FCO paper giving “the legal background in more detail”.279
783.  Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer and Mr Straw’s letter to the Chairman of the
FAC, with a copy of Lord Goldsmith’s Answer and a FCO paper which addressed the
legal background, are addressed in Section 5.
784.  To supplement the Command Paper of UN documents published in February
(Cm 5769), Mr Straw published a further Command Paper (Cm 5785) with UN
documents from early March.280
785.  That comprised:

•	
•	
•	
•	

Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei’s statements to the Security Council on 7 March;
Mr Straw’s statement to the Security Council on 7 March;
UNMOVIC’s 12th quarterly report to the Security Council: and
UNMOVIC’s working document of “unresolved disarmament issues”, the
“clusters” document of 6 March 2003.

786.  Mr Straw wrote to all Parliamentary colleagues with a copy of the FCO paper of
15 March on Iraq’s non-compliance (considered earlier in this Section), a copy of his
letter to the Chairman of the FAC, and copies of the statements made at the Azores
Summit the previous day.281
787.  Mr Straw wrote that the FCO paper, ‘Iraqi Non-Compliance with UNSCR 1441’,
stated that Iraq had “failed to comply fully with 14 previous UN resolutions related
to WMD” and assessed Iraq’s “progress in complying with relevant provisions of
UNSCR 1441 with illustrative examples”.

THE MILITARY PLAN
788.  A letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Sir David Manning on 17 March confirmed
that the military plan took full account of the risks and problems identified by the JIC
Note of 13 March, ‘Saddam’s Plan for Baghdad’.282
789.  The MOD’s objectives and plans for the military campaign, and the JIC’s
assessments of Iraq’s capabilities and intent, and are addressed in Sections 6.2 and 8.
MR SCARLETT’S ADVICE, 17 MARCH 2003
790.  In response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Scarlett provided advice on
“the strength of evidence showing Saddam’s possession of WMD”.283
791.  In relation to Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons capability, Mr Scarlett
concluded that the JIC view was clear: Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons,
the means to deliver them, and the capacity to produce them.
792.  Mr Scarlett attributed the failure to find any significant evidence of chemical and
biological weapons to Iraq’s ability to conceal its activities and deceive the inspectors.
793.  Mr Scarlett’s advice is addressed in more detail in Section 4.3.
794.  A draft of the document held by the MOD, also dated 17 March 2003, shows
Sir David Omand, Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary and Security and Intelligence
Co-ordinator, Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS),
Sir Francis Richards, Director, Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)
and senior officials in the MOD, the FCO and the Cabinet Office as copy recipients.284
795.  The Government was unable to find any evidence that the final version of
Mr Scarlett’s minute to Sir David Manning was sent to anyone outside No.10.285

Cabinet, 17 March 2003
796.  A specially convened Cabinet at 1600 on 17 March 2003 endorsed the
decision to give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to leave Iraq and to ask the
House of Commons to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to enforce
compliance, if necessary.
797.  Mr Blair told his colleagues that he had called the Cabinet because “an impasse”
had been reached at the UN.286

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

798.  The Government had tried its “utmost”, and had “tabled a draft … resolution,
amended it, and then been prepared to apply tests against which Iraq’s co-operation …
could be judged”. Although the UK had been “gathering increasing support from
members of the Security Council”, the French statement “that they would veto a
resolution in all circumstances had made it impossible to achieve a new … resolution”.
France, with Russia in support, “were not prepared to accept” that if Saddam Hussein
“did not comply with the United Nations obligations, military action should follow”.
The UK was in a situation it had “striven to avoid”: “There would be no second resolution
and military action was likely to be necessary … to enforce compliance by Saddam
Hussein with Iraq’s obligations.”
799.  Mr Blair stated that the US “had now undertaken to produce a ‘Road Map’ for the
Middle East Peace Process, once the new Palestinian Prime Minister’s appointment
had been confirmed”. That would “open the way to a full and final settlement within
three years”. The US “had also confirmed” that it “would seek a UN mandate for the
post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq”, and: “Oil revenues would be administered under
the UN’s authority.”
800.  Mr Blair stated:
“A lot of work was needed to repair the strains which had arisen internationally over
the past few weeks. He regretted that the international community had sent mixed
messages to Saddam Hussein, whose regime could have been disarmed peacefully
if confronted by international solidarity. The blockage we had encountered in the
United Nations impeded any progress.”
801.  Mr Straw said that Mr Blair:
“… had persuaded President Bush … to go down the United Nations route in order
to achieve the maximum authority for the disarmament of Iraq, but the diplomatic
process was now at an end.”
802.  Mr Straw added:
“Progress had been made towards forging a consensus before the French and
Russians had indicated their intention to veto any Security Council resolution
proposed which indicated that military action would follow Saddam Hussein’s failure
to comply. His assessment was that President Chirac of France had decided to open
up a strategic divide between France and the United Kingdom; the row in Brussels
in late 2002 had been manufactured. Effectively, one member of the Security
Council had torpedoed the whole process.”
803.  Mr Straw concluded:
“… the one chance now remaining to Saddam Hussein was to seek exile. If that
course failed, the Government would seek the support of the House of Commons

540

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

for military action against Iraq. There would be a substantive motion in a debate now
scheduled for Tuesday [18 March].”
804.  Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that he had answered a Parliamentary Question in
the House of Lords that day “on the authority for the use of force against Iraq”; and that
Mr Straw had also sent a document “on the legal basis” to the FAC.
805.  The minutes record that Lord Goldsmith informed Cabinet that:
“Authority existed from the combined effect of United Nations Security Council
resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all of which were adopted under Chapter VII of the
United Nations Charter. The latter allowed the use of force for the express purpose
of restoring international peace and security … resolution 1441 determined that
Iraq had been and remained in material breach of … resolution 687 and gave Iraq
a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations, warning of serious
consequences if it did not do so. It was plain that Iraq had failed so to comply and
therefore continued to be in material breach. The authority to use force under
… resolution 678 was revived as a result … [R]esolution 1441 did not contain
a requirement for a further … resolution to authorise the use of force.”
806.  The points made during discussion included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

the attitude of France “had undermined the mechanism of the United Nations
to enforce the will of the international community”;
with the removal of a tyrant and the new initiative on the MEPP, “a different
Middle East was in prospect”;
“after the strenuous efforts to find a diplomatic solution”, the Government “had
enhanced its credibility by the integrity and consistency of its position on Iraq”;
the Government’s supporters “needed a comprehensive statement to explain
the position”: a second resolution “had been politically desirable but not
legally essential”;
“it was important to focus on Saddam’s failure to comply, and to avoid the
impression that the failure to gain a further … resolution was the issue”;
within the UK the views of all citizens had to be respected and a dialogue with
the Muslim community maintained, “while setting out clearly the case for military
action in the current circumstances”;
failure to disarm Iraq “risked sending a message of encouragement to dictators
and countries illegally holding weapons of mass destruction”;
in conducting military operations, it would be important to show “we wished to
protect civilians, seek the surrender of Iraqi conscripts, and protect religious and
cultural sites”;
the Government’s commitment to the UN was to make “its writ run” and to
encourage its members to work within that framework;

541

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

•	
•	
•	
•	

the “stalemate” in the UN “should prompt a new look at the international security
architecture whose modernisation needed to be addressed”;
as occupation forces would be “restricted” in the action they could take, there
was a legal necessity for a UN mandate for the reconstruction of Iraq;
the “real test of the Government’s credibility” would be the extent to which the
MEPP was driven forward “and the manner in which the Iraqi people were cared
for after the conflict”; and
the Government “was motivated by a world view which promoted justice, good
governance and pluralism and this set it apart from other governments of the
industrialised world”.

807.  Mr Prescott stated that Mr Blair:
“… had played a major role in upholding the credibility of the United Nations.
French intransigence had thwarted success in taking the United Nations process to
its logical conclusion. Nevertheless, the use of force against Iraq was authorised by
existing … resolutions.”
808.  Mr Blair concluded that:
“… the diplomatic process was now at an end. Saddam Hussein would be given
an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the House of Commons would be asked to endorse
the use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary.”
809.  Cabinet: “Took note.”
810.  Mr Cook’s decision to resign from the Government was announced during Cabinet,
which he did not attend.287
811.  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to
Baroness Ramsey setting out the legal basis for military action.
812.  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position –
it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take
“the final opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by
resolution 1441.
813.  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as Lord
Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding
the legal effect of resolution 1441 and whether, in particular, it authorised military
action without a further resolution of the Security Council.

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

814.  Cabinet was not provided with, or informed of, Mr Brummell’s letter to
Mr Rycroft of 14 March; or Mr Rycroft’s response of 15 March. Cabinet was not
told how Mr Blair had reached the view recorded in Mr Rycroft’s letter.
815.  The consideration of the legal basis for military action and the evidence from
those present on the discussion of the legal issues in Cabinet is addressed in
Section 5.
816.  The majority of Cabinet members who gave evidence to the Inquiry took
the position that the role of the Attorney General on 17 March was, simply, to tell
Cabinet whether or not there was a legal basis for military action.
817.  None of those Ministers who had read Lord Goldsmith’s 7 March advice
asked for an explanation as to why his legal view of resolution 1441 had changed.
818.  There was little appetite to question Lord Goldsmith about his advice, and
no substantive discussion of the legal issues was recorded.
819.  Cabinet was, however, being asked to confirm the decision that the
diplomatic process was at an end and that the House of Commons should
be asked to endorse the use of military action to enforce Iraq’s compliance.
Given the gravity of this decision, Cabinet should have been made aware of
the legal uncertainties.
820.  Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which
fully reflected the position on 17 March, explained the legal basis on which the
UK could take military action, and set out the risks of legal challenge.
821.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued to attribute the primary responsibility for
the failure to secure support in the Security Council to France’s statements that
it would veto a resolution setting an ultimatum for Iraq to demonstrate that it was
co-operating as required by resolution 1441.
822.  As the evidence in this Section shows, the Security Council was deeply
divided and China, France and Russia, and others, took the view that options
other than the use of military force had not yet been exhausted.
823.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had told Cabinet that “an impasse
was an impasse” and that the “French block” was “not conditional but absolute”.288
824.  In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:
“Apart from Clare Short, the Cabinet were supportive. All my most loyal people
weighed in. As ever on these occasions, John Prescott was a rock. Derry Irvine
[Lord Irvine of Lairg, the Lord Chancellor] came in with a very helpful intervention

to Iraq. Hutchinson, 2012.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

saying that if France had not threatened to veto any resolution authorising action, we
could probably have got a second resolution and the problem was that we had tried
so hard to get a second resolution that people assumed, wrongly, that we needed
one legally.”289
825.  In his memoir, Mr Prescott wrote that:
“Apart from Clare and Robin, everyone understood and accepted what was
happening. Although we all had worries, we tended to go along with the feeling that
we were stuck with Bush. Tony couldn’t walk away. We were blaming the French,
for backing out of supporting an invasion, but we knew the Americans would go in
whatever happened, so the French didn’t really matter.
“Our relationship with the US had always been fundamental. All British prime
ministers have to decide whether we’re with the US or not. And Tony had decided
we were. Most of us agreed with that, deep down. During the run-up to the invasion,
we all had our own reservations, and we were genuinely trying to delay an actual
invasion, and go the UN route, if not stop it altogether, for as long as possible.
But once it was inevitable we felt that was it.
“My attitude was that Tony, having made up his mind, should be supported. I took
one of the Cabinet meetings on Iraq and got quite carried away, saying it was vital
to stick together. We should do the brave thing, not be cowards.”290
826.  Lord Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry
that he had been “governed by a desire” that he sensed was shared with colleagues that
“military action should be a last resort” and that it was not until Cabinet on 17 March:
“… when it was clear that all other options had been exhausted and where we
had the benefit of legal opinion … that I formed the firm view that it was now
inevitable.”291

Statements to Parliament, 17 March 2003
MR STRAW’S STATEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003
827.  In his Statement to the House of Commons that evening, Mr Straw said the
Government had reluctantly concluded that France’s actions had put a consensus
in the Security Council on a further resolution “beyond reach”.
828.  As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s
demands, Cabinet had decided to ask the House of Commons to support the
UK’s participation in military action should that be necessary to achieve the

disarmament of Iraq “and thereby the maintenance of the authority of the
United Nations”.
829.  Mr Straw stated that Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer “set out the legal
basis for the use of force”.
830.  Mr Straw drew attention to the significance of the fact that no one “in
discussions in the Security Council and outside” had claimed that Iraq was in
full compliance with its obligations.
831.  Mr Straw made a statement to the House of Commons at 8.24pm.292
832.  Referring to the statement issued at the Azores Summit calling on all members
of the Security Council to adopt a resolution challenging Saddam Hussein to take
a strategic decision to disarm, Mr Straw told the House of Commons:
“Such a resolution has never been needed legally, but we have long had
a preference for it politically.”
833.  Mr Straw stated that there had been “intense diplomatic activity to secure that
end over many months, culminating in the last 24 hours”. Despite “final efforts” by Sir
Jeremy Greenstock the previous evening and his own conversations with his “Spanish,
American, Russian and Chinese counterparts that morning”, the Government had:
“… reluctantly concluded that a Security Council consensus on a new resolution
would not be possible. On my instructions, Sir Jeremy Greenstock made a public
announcement to that effect at the United Nations at about 3.15pm UK time today.”
834.  Mr Straw continued that, since the adoption of resolution 1441 in November
2002, he, Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock had “strained every nerve” in search of
a consensus “which could finally persuade Iraq by peaceful means, to provide the full
and immediate co-operation demanded by the Security Council”.
835.  Mr Straw stated that it was significant that “in all the discussions in the Security
Council and outside” no-one had claimed that Iraq was “in full compliance with the
obligations placed on it”; and:
“Given that, it was my belief, up to about a week ago, that we were close to
achieving a consensus that we sought on the further resolution. Sadly, one country
then ensured that the Security Council could not act. President Chirac’s unequivocal
announcement last Monday that France would veto a second resolution containing
that or any ultimatum ‘whatever the circumstances’ inevitably created a sense of
paralysis in our negotiations. I deeply regret that France has thereby put a Security
Council consensus beyond reach.”

292

545

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

836.  Mr Straw told the House of Commons that the proposals submitted by France,
Germany and Russia for “more time and more inspections” sought to “rewrite” resolution
1441. They “would have allowed Saddam to continue stringing out inspections
indefinitely, and he would rightly have drawn the lesson that the Security Council was
simply not prepared to enforce the ultimatum … at the heart of resolution 1441”.
837.  Mr Straw pointed out that “in the event of non-compliance” Iraq should, as OP13
of resolution 1441 spelled out, expect “serious consequences”. Mr Straw stated:
“As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s demands,
and the inability of the Security Council to adopt a further resolution, the Cabinet
has decided to ask the House to support the United Kingdom’s participation in
military operations, should they be necessary, with the objective of ensuring the
disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, and thereby the maintenance
of the authority of the United Nations.”
838.  Mr Straw confirmed that Parliament “would have an opportunity to debate our
involvement in military action prior to hostilities” the following day; and that the debate
would be on a substantive motion “proposed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet
colleagues”. He also drew the attention of the House to Lord Goldsmith’s Written
Answer, which “set out the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq” and the
documents provided earlier that day.
839.  Mr Straw concluded:
“Some say that Iraq can be disarmed without an ultimatum, without the threat or the
use of force, but simply by more time and more inspections. That approach is defied
by all our experience over 12 weary years. It cannot produce the disarmament of
Iraq; it cannot rid the world of the danger of the Iraq regime. It can only bring comfort
to tyrants and emasculate the authority of the United Nations …”
840.  Mr Ancram responded that diplomacy was “at an end” and there was the “grim
prospect of war … because Saddam Hussein has contemptuously failed to take the final
opportunity … offered him”. There had been “a chance that a clear, unequivocal and
united voice from the international community might … have persuaded him to disarm
or to go. France put paid to that. I hope that in Paris they will reflect tonight on what they
have achieved.”293
841.  Mr Ancram stated: “Saddam Hussein, in possession of weapons of mass
destruction, is a threat to international peace and security… including ourselves.
That is why we believe that action to disarm him can no longer be delayed.”

293 

House of Commons, Official Report, 17 March 2003, columns 705-706.

546

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

842.  Mr Ancram concluded:
“Our thoughts tonight must be with our Armed Forces … they have our unqualified
support. We will offer the Government our support in the decisions that must now be
made. We will do so because they have reached the same conclusions as us on the
threat posed by Saddam Hussein and the legality of taking action. We believe they
are acting in the national interest and as long as that is the case we will continue to
support them. Her Majesty’s Opposition will do what in our hearts we know for our
country to be right.”
843.  In response to a question from Mr Moore about the implications of taking action
without the backing of the Security Council and allowing inspections to continue,
Mr Straw agreed that it would have been better to achieve a consensus in the UN.
He also stated that France and Russia had agreed the process in resolution 1441:
“… if Iraq was in further material breach, which it has been for weeks, setting out
further discussions in the Security Council, which have already taken place; and …
if Iraq failed to comply, serious consequences would follow.”294
844.  The provisions required by resolution 1441 were examined in depth by Lord
Goldsmith in his advice of 7 March, which is addressed in Section 5.
845.  Asked about his statement to the House of Commons on 17 March that it was his
“belief, up to about a week ago, that we were close to achieving a consensus that we
sought on the further resolution”, Mr Straw told the Inquiry:
“My point … was accurate. I didn’t say we had a consensus. I said we were close
to it.”295
846.  Mr Straw’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords by Baroness Symons of
Vernham Dean, the joint FCO/Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Minister for Trade
and Investment.296
847.  In reply to the points made in response to her statement, Baroness Symons made
a number of comments, including:
“… I believe that the legality of the position is indeed settled. I do not think we have
ever had such a clear statement from the Attorney General at a juncture like this.”297
848.  Subsequently, Baroness Symons stated that the Government “had gone further
than any Government” to put the “advice” into the public arena, and that Lord Goldsmith
had “given a clear statement of his opinion”.298

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

849.  Baroness Symons’ statement took place during a debate on the legality of the
use of armed force. In closing the debate, Baroness Symons again stated that Lord
Goldsmith had published his “advice”.299
850.  As Section 5 explains, the Written Answer was not Lord Goldsmith’s advice or
his legal opinion.
851.  Other points raised during the debate on the legality of the use of armed force are
set out in the Box below.

House of Lords debate on the legality
of the use of armed force, 17 March 2003
The House of Lords debated the legality of the use of armed force on the evening of
17 March.
Opening the debate, Lord Goodhart (Liberal Democrat) set out his view of the legality of
the use of force in Iraq without the specific authority of a further resolution of the Security
Council. Commenting on the summary of Lord Goldsmith’s legal advice to the Government
he stated:
“… we should have liked to see much more detail of what must have been a lengthy
opinion … All we have seen is the baldly stated summary. We also regret that the
… Attorney General has not given us the opportunity to ask questions and to hear
his answers.
“The Attorney General’s opinion reaches a highly questionable conclusion, which
is based on a dubious interpretation of deliberately ambiguous wording.
…
“Both the United States and British Ambassadors to the United Nations when
resolution 1441 was adopted said that it contained no automaticity. I believe that
there was a clear understanding that resolution 1441 did not confer a right of action
without referring back to the Security Council. Unless there had been such an
understanding, it would have been difficult if not impossible to get resolution 1441
through the Security Council.
“A final decision on the use of armed force requires judgement as to the seriousness
of the breaches by Iraq, the effectiveness of the inspection system and whether the
breaches could be corrected by means short of war. Those are difficult decisions.
The Attorney General is arguing that the Security Council has delegated those
decisions to the United Kingdom and the United States of America – in effect, to the
US alone. I do not believe that that is the kind of decision that the Security Council
could, or would, delegate to any one member, however powerful. A decision to use
armed force under Article 42 in full scale war is the most solemn decision that the
Security Council can ever take. The idea that vague and ambiguous words in those

House of Lords, Official Report, 17 March 2003, column 1117.

548

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

resolutions can be read as implying a delegation to the United States, with or without
the United Kingdom, to take these decisions verges on the absurd.”300
A range of views was expressed by speakers during the ensuing debate.
Lord Mayhew (Conservative) described the United Nations as “a relatively new
jurisdiction”.301 The world was far from having “an article or precedent” for every situation
it faced. As a result, there would often be arguments “which it would take years to litigate
in any international court to an authoritative conclusion”. He concluded that UN member
states “must sometimes have the courage to act when the law may not be explicitly cut
and dried and to bear the heavy duty themselves for doing what they conscientiously
believe to be necessary and lawful.”
Lord Mayhew stated that, because the cease-fire established under resolution 687 was
conditional, it had left resolution 678 undischarged: “in force, but … placed in abeyance
or suspension provided Iraq fulfilled its obligations and continued to fulfil the conditions”.
Because Iraq had never complied with those conditions, resolution 678 was no longer
in abeyance, but available. Those who refused to agree a further resolution were
entitled to make that choice, but it could not have the effect of a veto on the operation
of resolution 678.
Lord Hannay, a former UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations, stated that
resolution 1441 had not, on its own, provided authority for the use of force in the event
of non-compliance because it had not needed to.302 The authority already existed in
resolution 687. That there had been Iraqi non-compliance since resolution 687 was “surely
not seriously in doubt”. That there had been some limited compliance was not the point.
Unfortunately, the Security Council had “fallen prey to divided counsels”. The purpose of
the draft second resolution had been political, not legal: “to draw a line under the phase
on non-compliance with Security Council resolution 1441 and to signal that serious
consequences were now imminent.”
Lord Hannay concluded that military action by the UK, the US and other allies:
“… does not herald either a new doctrine bypassing the system laid down in the UN
Charter, nor the flouting of international law. In fact, it is far less daring than was the
decision by NATO to use force against Yugoslavia in the case of Kosovo …”
Lord Howell (Conservative) stated that the question of legality “ought to have been settled
long before we reached the point at which the troops are going into action”.303 There was
“no doubt” that the case for intervention had been “poorly put forward”, adding greatly
to tensions.
Lord Lloyd of Berwick, a former Law Lord, stated that he found it “impossible as presently
advised” to accept the argument offered by Lord Goldsmith in his Written Answer to
Baroness Ramsey.304

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Responding to points raised during the debate, Baroness Symons set out the
Government’s position, including by reference to previous occasions since 1991 when
force had been used in Iraq.305 She stated that resolution 1441:
“… provided for any failure by Iraq to be ‘considered’ by the Security Council under
paragraph 12. That consideration has taken place regularly since the adoption of
resolution 1441. It is plain from UNMOVIC statements … that Iraq has not complied,
as required, with its disarmament obligations. Whatever other differences there
may be on the Security Council, no member of the Council has questioned that
conclusion. It follows that Iraq has not taken the final opportunity offered and remains
in material breach …”

MR COOK’S RESIGNATION STATEMENT, 17 MARCH 2003
852.  In a statement later that evening, Mr Cook set out his doubts about the
degree to which Saddam Hussein posed a “clear and present danger” and his
concerns that the UK was being “pushed too quickly into conflict” by the US
without the support of the UN and in the face of hostility from many of the UK’s
traditional allies.
853.  Mr Cook set out the reasons why he could not “support a war without international
agreement or domestic support” and why, in order to vote against military action in the
House of Commons the following day, he had resigned from the Government.306
854.  Mr Cook applauded the “heroic efforts” of Mr Blair and those of Mr Straw in seeking
to secure a second resolution, but pointed out:
“… the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed.
Now that those attempts have failed, we cannot pretend that getting a second
resolution was of no importance.
“France has been at the receiving end of bucket-loads of commentary in recent
days. It is not France alone that wants more time for inspections … We delude
ourselves if we think that the degree of international hostility is all the result
of President Chirac. The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on
a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are
a leading partner …
“To end up in such diplomatic weakness is a serious reverse. Only a year ago, we
and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and
more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible. History will be astonished at
the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful
coalition. The US can afford to go it alone … Our interests are best protected not by

unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world governed by rules. Yet
tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened … Those
are heavy casualties in a war in which a shot has yet to be fired.”
855.  Dismissing any parallels with the action in Kosovo in 1999, where there had been
multilateral support and the need to respond to an urgent and compelling humanitarian
crisis, Mr Cook stated:
“Our difficulty in getting support this time is that neither the international community
nor the British public is persuaded that there is an urgent and compelling reason for
this military action in Iraq.
“The threshold for war should always be high. None of us can predict the death toll
of civilians …”
856.  Mr Cook continued:
“Nor is it fair to accuse those of us who want longer for inspections of not having
an alternative strategy … Over the past decade that strategy [of containment] had
destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf War, dismantled Iraq’s nuclear weapons
programme and halted Saddam’s medium and long range missile programmes.”
Iraq’s military strength was now less than half its size in 1991; and, “Ironically” it was
“only because Iraq’s military forces” were “so weak that we can even contemplate
its invasion”.
857.  Mr Cook questioned the threat posed by Iraq:
“Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood
sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against
a strategic city target. It probably … has biological toxins and battlefield chemical
munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold Saddam
anthrax agents and the then British government approved chemical and munitions
factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a
military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we helped to
create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam’s ambition to
complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of UN inspectors?”
858.  Drawing attention to the lack of action in the face of Israel’s refusal to comply with
resolution 242 (1967) demanding its withdrawal from the Occupied Territories, Mr Cook
warned of the “strong sense of injustice throughout the Muslim world” as a result of the
perception that there was “one rule for the allies of the US and another rule for the rest”.
He added:
“Nor is our credibility helped by the appearance that our partners in Washington
are less interested in disarmament than they are in regime change in Iraq. That

551

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

explains why any evidence that inspections may be showing progress is greeted in
Washington not with satisfaction but with consternation: it reduces the case for war.”
859.  Mr Cook concluded that the British people:
“… do not doubt that Saddam is a brutal dictator, but they are not persuaded that
he is a clear and present danger to Britain. They want inspections to be given a
chance, and they suspect that they are being pushed too quickly into conflict by a
US Administration with an agenda of its own. Above all they are uneasy at Britain
going out on a limb on a military adventure without a broader international coalition
and against the hostility of many of our traditional allies.”
860.  Mr Cook’s account of his view of the September dossier and the briefing he was
given in February 2003 by Mr Scarlett are addressed in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.

Ms Short’s letter, 18 March 2003
Ms Short sent a letter to colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party the following
morning, explaining her reasons for deciding to support the Government.307 She wrote that
there had been “a number of important developments over the last week”, including:
“Firstly, the Attorney General has made clear that military action would be legal under
international law. Other lawyers have expressed contrary opinions. But for the UK
Government, the civil service and the military, it is the view of the Attorney General
that matters and this is unequivocal.”

President Bush’s ultimatum to Saddam Hussein, 17 March 2003
861.  President Bush issued an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein 48 hours to
leave Iraq.
862.  The British Embassy Washington reported that the US media had:
“… recognised the Azores outcome as the beginning of the end game, and declared
the diplomatic process dead even before we announced the end in the Security
Council … Both the Washington Post and the New York Times referred to the US
and its allies ‘going through the motions’.”308
863.  The Embassy wrote that US commentators were:
“… already apportioning blame for the Administration’s failure to muster
international support …
“The longer-term fallout from almost six months of activity at the UN would probably
only be clear once the war is over. But the media has already gone into analysis

mode. One of the larger issues is whither US/UN relations. Powell said today that
the UN would survive, but was equally clear that the UNSC had failed a crucial test
… the Administration hawks who cautioned Bush against the UN route last summer
are sourcing stories making their opposition at that time clear.”
864.  The Embassy also reported that US public support for war had risen to its highest
level since November 2001, “though support would drop to 47 percent without a second
resolution”. Mr Blair’s role had “won fulsome praise from some unexpected quarters”.
865.  Secretary Powell announced in his morning press conference on 17 March that
President Bush would issue an ultimatum during his address to the nation that evening
calling for Saddam and his cohorts to leave Iraq.309
866.  In an “Address to the Nation” at 8pm Eastern Standard Time on 17 March,
President Bush stated that “the final days of decision” had been reached and issued
an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq.310
867.  President Bush stated that the world had “engaged in 12 years of diplomacy” and
“sent hundreds of weapons inspectors to oversee the disarmament of Iraq” but:
“Our good faith has not been returned.
“The Iraqi regime has used diplomacy as a ploy to gain time and advantage …
Peaceful efforts to disarm the Iraqi regime have failed … because we are not dealing
with peaceful men.
“Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the
Iraqi regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons
ever devised …
“The regime has a history of reckless aggression … It has a deep hatred of
America and our friends. And it has aided, trained and harbored terrorists, including
operatives of Al Qaida.
“The danger is clear: using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons,
obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and
kill hundreds of thousands of innocent people …
“… Before the day of horror can come, before it is too late to act, this danger will
be removed.
“The United States of America has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring
its own national security. That duty falls to me …

The White House, 17 March 2003, President says Saddam Hussein must leave within 48 hours.

553

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Recognizing the threat to our country, the United States Congress voted
overwhelmingly last year to support the use of force against Iraq. America tried to
work with the United Nations to address this threat because we wanted to resolve
this issue peacefully. We believe in the mission of the United Nations. One reason
the UN was founded … was to confront aggressive dictators, actively and early …
“In the case of Iraq, the Security Council did act, in the early 1990s. Under
resolutions 678 and 687 – both still in effect – the United States and our allies are
authorized to use force in ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. This is not
a question of authority, it is a question of will.”
868.  President Bush continued that he had “urged the nations of the world to unite
and bring an end to this danger” and the Security Council had unanimously passed
resolution 1441. But:
“… no nation could possibly claim that Iraq has disarmed. And it will not disarm
as long as Saddam holds power as required … some permanent members of the
Security Council have publicly announced that they will veto any resolution that
compels the disarmament of Iraq. These governments share our assessment of
the danger, but not our resolve to meet it. Many nations … do have the resolve and
fortitude to act against this threat to peace … The United Nations Security Council
has not lived up to its responsibilities, so we will rise to ours.”
869.  Issuing the ultimatum, President Bush stated:
“In recent days, some governments in the Middle East have been doing their part.
They have delivered public and private messages urging the dictator to leave
Iraq, so that disarmament can proceed peacefully. He has thus far refused. All
the decades of deceit and cruelty have now reached an end. Saddam Hussein
and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours. Their refusal to do so will result
in military conflict …”
870.  In a message to Iraqis, President Bush stated:
“If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men
who rule your country and not against you … The day of your liberation is near.
“… It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country
by permitting the peaceful entry of Coalition forces to eliminate weapons of
mass destruction …”
871.  President Bush explicitly warned all Iraqis against destroying oil wells or using
weapons of mass destruction: “War crimes will be prosecuted. War criminals will
be punished.”

554

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

872.  President Bush acknowledged that military action could expose the US and its
allies to an increased possibility of attack and that additional security measures had
been put in place. He concluded:
“We are now acting because the risk of inaction would be greater … Saddam
Hussein and his terrorist allies could choose the moment of deadly conflict when
they are strongest. We choose to meet that threat now …
“… a policy of appeasement could bring destruction of a kind never before seen
on this earth.
“… responding to such enemies only after they have struck first is not self-defense,
it is suicide. The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein now.
“As we enforce the just demands of the world, we will also honor the deepest
commitments of our country. Unlike Saddam Hussein, we believe the Iraqi people
are deserving and capable of human liberty. And when the dictator has departed,
they can set an example to all the Middle East of a vital and peaceful and
self‑governing nation.
“The United States, with other countries, will work to advance liberty and peace
in that region. Our goal will not be achieved overnight, but it can come over time.
The power and appeal of human liberty is felt in every life and every land. And the
greatest power of freedom is to overcome hatred and violence and turn … to the
pursuits of peace.
“That is the future we choose. Free nations have a duty to defend our people by
uniting against the violent. And tonight, as we have done before, America and our
allies accept that responsibility.”
873.  The British Embassy Washington reported that President Bush “looked nervous but
the message was uncompromising. Only a complete climb down by Saddam can now
prevent war.”311
874.  A later telegram reported that a White House spokesman had “amplified” the
President’s statement and said that, if Saddam Hussein were to comply with the
deadline and go into exile, US troops would still enter Iraq in order to pursue and disarm
WMD; and that he hoped the international community would consider prosecuting
Saddam Hussein for war crimes even in the case of exile.312
875.  The Embassy also reported that “some 66 percent of Americans told Gallup that
they supported Bush’s intention to attack if Saddam did not leave within 48 hours”; and
that “around 68 percent … agreed that the US had done everything possible to solve the

crisis diplomatically”. A “vocal minority, including the Democratic … leadership” did not
support President Bush.
876.  Separately, the Embassy reported that President Bush had decided to publish
the names of nine Iraqis who were regarded as either war criminals or having decisive
command and control responsibilities.313
877.  Mr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, rejected the US ultimatum.314
878.  On the morning of 17 March, Mr Campbell had written to Mr Bartlett setting out the
planned timetable for announcements, and commenting that: “By tonight, things will be
pretty febrile.”315
879.  Mr Campbell predicted that the debate in Parliament the following day would
be difficult: “the rebellion looks bigger than last time”. He warned Mr Bartlett of the
potential that:
“If our MPs wake up to ‘Bush tells Saddam: go into exile or face war’ we’ll hold most
of our people. If they wake up to ‘Bush: we’re at war’ with the ultimatum drowned
out, with no mention of humanitarian, or MEPP etc, we’ll be in trouble. It’ll be hard
for the President to win people back for us, but he could push some of our wobblers
over the edge.”
880.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that the ultimatum had the UK’s “changes all taken on
board”, and that it was “balanced not bellicose”, “strongly supportive of the Iraqi people”;
“And, critically for me, it played up the Middle East Peace Process.”316

Events of 18 March 2003
AUSTRALIA COMMITS TROOPS
881.  In response to a formal request from President Bush, “shortly after 0600 local
time”, for Australia to participate in any military intervention in Iraq should Saddam
Hussein not respond to the ultimatum and an “immediate” meeting of the Australian
Cabinet, Mr Howard announced that a decision had been taken to commit Australian
troops, and that:
“… the Government strongly believed the decision taken was right, it was legal,
it was directed towards the protection of the Australian national interest.”317
882.  Mr Howard also stated that the Iraq issue was one of morality and not just
legality. He agreed to table immediately in Parliament the text of the legal advice to the

Australian Government which he said was consistent with the advice given to the British
Government by Lord Goldsmith.
PRESIDENT CHIRAC’S STATEMENT
883.  President Chirac maintained his position that the UN route had not been
exhausted and the Security Council should explicitly authorise the use of force.
The US was taking unilateral action against the will of the international community.
884.  Sir John Holmes reported on 17 March that France was taking UK “criticism on the
chin for the moment”, and was saying that it would be ready to help in the post-conflict
period, “but the greater the UN role, the easier it will be for them”.318 Senior advisers to
Mr de Villepin and Mr Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the French Prime Minister, understood the
UK position but had “made clear that they regretted nothing, and believed that they had
acted perfectly consistently throughout”. Mr de Villepin’s “clear view was that France
should not stoop to respond to our criticism, but the Elysée were less calm”.
885.  Sir John concluded:
“The French shifted a little as we approached the wire. Villepin’s acceptance of our
six tests when he spoke to you [Straw] … was particularly interesting, given his
previous sharp public rejection. But all this was far too little, far too late: positioning
rather than a genuine effort at agreement. The French know they are now cast as
scapegoats but, at least for the time being, seem to be determined to maintain a
dignified silence, on the assumption that once war begins we will all have an interest
in coming together at the UN to handle the aftermath.”
886.  The Elysée issued a statement early on 18 March stating that the US ultimatum
was a unilateral decision going against the will of the international community who
wanted to pursue Iraqi disarmament in accordance with resolution 1441.319 It stated:
“… only the Security Council is authorised to legitimise the use of force. France
appeals to the responsibility of all to see that international legality is respected.
To disregard the legitimacy of the UN, to favour force over the law, would be to take
on a heavy responsibility.”
887.  President Chirac issued a recorded speech later that morning which reiterated that
statement and made a number of other comments, including:
“France’s action has been inspired by the primacy of international law …
“… France considers the use of force is a last resort when all other options
have been exhausted. France’s stance is shared by the great majority of the
international community.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“The latest discussions clearly showed that the Security Council was not disposed
in the current circumstances to sanction a rush to war.
“The United States has just given Iraq an ultimatum. Whether it is a question … of
the necessary disarming of Iraq or the desirable change of regime in that country,
there is no justification here for a unilateral decision to resort to war.
“However events develop in the near future, this ultimatum calls into question the
notion we have of international relations. It commits the future of a people, the future
of a region, and the stability of the world.
“It is a grave decision at a time when the disarmament of Iraq is under way and the
inspections have proved they were a credible alternative for disarming that country.
“It is also a decision which compromises – for the future – the methods of peacefully
resolving crises linked to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq does
not today represent an immediate threat such as to justify an immediate war.”320
888.  Sir John Holmes commented that President Chirac’s statement continued to
emphasise France’s position “as on the side of the majority”, but that his description
of regime change as “desirable” might be “significant”.321 President Chirac “could have
been more categorical on the legal authority and used the language of condemnation”.
Sir John concluded that President Chirac had “kept his options open for co-operation
over the day after”.
889.  Reporting after the start of the conflict, Sir John Holmes offered the view that
President Chirac had consistently disagreed with UK policy on Iraq on sanctions and
military action.322 French policy had been driven by his personal convictions. President
Chirac had never believed that Saddam Hussein was “really a danger to us” and France
had disagreed with UK policy on sanctions and military action. France had:
“… only ever agreed with great reluctance to each step to ratchet up the pressure
on Saddam while accepting that only our military pressure had made him [Saddam]
co‑operate … [T]hey believe they have been consistent and that their opposition to
the use of force will in the end be vindicated.”
890.  Sir John wrote that it was hard to be sure of the exact moment when France
resolved to take on some of their closest allies and veto action if necessary. The
“present hard line was inherent in the Franco-German position in late January” but
Sir John’s view was that President Chirac had begun to see the attractions of a veto
during February and his confidence in a Russian veto increased after Mr Ivanov’s visit
to Paris on 5 March. The crucial element had been the realisation shortly after that

of persuading the “swing six” to abstain “unless France was … ready to say she
would veto”.
MR BLAIR’S CONVERSATION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 18 MARCH 2003
891.  Mr Blair spoke to President Bush at 1830 on 18 March.323 Mr Blair said that he was
starting to win the political argument in the UK; and that the opinion polls were moving
in his favour. They agreed to keep in touch “on a daily basis” and considered meeting
in Washington the following week. Mr Blair said that he was “keen to follow up in some
detail some of the issues raised in the Azores”.
892.  On 18 March, Sir David Manning wrote to Dr Rice, formally confirming the UK’s
agreement to US use of Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford for “operations to enforce
compliance by Iraq with the obligations on Weapons of Mass Destruction laid down
in UNSCR 1441 and previous relevant resolutions”.324
CDS’ DIRECTIVE FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS
893.  Adm Boyce’s Directive to Lieutenant General John Reith, the UK Commander Joint
Operations for Operation TELIC, was issued at 2300 on 18 March. Operations would not
begin before 1800 the following day.325
894.  The military plan and arrangements for the command and control of the military
operation are addressed in Sections 6.2 and 8.

material breach of its obligations under successive mandatory UN Security
Council resolutions;
regret that despite a sustained diplomatic effort by Her Majesty’s Government it
had not proved possible to secure a second resolution in the UN because one
Permanent Member of the Security Council made plain in public its intention to
use its veto whatever the circumstances;
note the opinion of the Attorney General that, Iraq having failed to comply and
Iraq being at the time of resolution 1441 and continuing to be in material breach,
the authority to use force under resolution 1441 has revived and so continued
that day;
believe that the United Kingdom must uphold the authority of the United Nations
as set out in resolution 1441 and many resolutions preceding it, and therefore
support the decision of Her Majesty’s Government that the United Kingdom
should use all means necessary to ensure the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons
of mass destruction;
offer wholehearted support to the men and women of Her Majesty’s Armed
Forces on duty in the Middle East;
in the event of military action require that, on an urgent basis, the United
Kingdom should seek a new Security Council resolution that would affirm
Iraq’s territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, allow for
the earliest possible lifting of UN sanctions, an international reconstruction
programme, and the use of all oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people
and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq, leading to a
representative government which upholds human rights and the rule of law for
all Iraqis;
welcome the imminent publication of the Quartet’s Road Map as a significant
step to bringing a just and lasting peace settlement between Israelis and
Palestinians and for the wider Middle East region, and endorse the role of
Her Majesty’s Government in actively working for peace between Israel
and Palestine.”326

897.  In his statement opening the debate, Mr Blair set out his position on the need for
military action.327
898.  Mr Blair told the House it faced a “tough choice” between standing down British
troops and turning back, and holding firm to “the course we have set”; and that he
believed “passionately” in the latter. That mattered because the outcome would not just
determine the fate of the Iraqi regime and the Iraqi people, but would:
“… determine the way in which Britain and the world confront the central security
threat of the 21st century, the development of the United Nations, the relationship

between Europe and the United States, the relations within the European Union and
the way in which the United States engages with the rest of the world. So it could
hardly be more important. It will determine the pattern of international politics for the
next generation.”
899.  Mr Blair rehearsed the Government’s position on Iraq’s past pursuit and use of
weapons of mass destruction; its failures to comply with the obligations imposed by
the UN Security Council between 1991 and 1998; Iraq’s repeated declarations which
proved to be false; and the “large quantities of weapons of mass destruction” which
were “unaccounted for”. He described UNSCOM’s final report (in January 1999) as
“a withering indictment of Saddam’s lies, deception and obstruction” in which “large
quantities of weapons of mass destruction” were “unaccounted for”.
900.  Addressing Saddam Hussein’s claims that Iraq had no weapons of mass
destruction, Mr Blair stated that “after seven years of obstruction and non-compliance”
before the inspectors left in 1998, “we are asked to believe” he had “voluntarily decided
to do what he had consistently refused to do under coercion”. Mr Blair also stated:
“We are asked now seriously to accept that in the last few years – contrary to all
history, contrary to all intelligence – Saddam decided unilaterally to destroy those
weapons. I say that such a claim is palpably absurd.”
901.  Resolution 1441 required “full, unconditional and immediate compliance”. The first
step was a full and final declaration of all Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Mr Blair
stated that he would not address the events that had taken place since the declaration
“as the House is familiar with them”, but “all members” of the Security Council “accepted”
that the Iraq declaration (of 7 December 2002) was false. That was:
“… in itself … a material breach. Iraq has taken some steps in co-operation but no
one disputes that it is not fully co-operating. Iraq continues to deny that it has any
weapons of mass destruction, although no serious intelligence service anywhere
in the world believes it.”
902.  Mr Blair cited the UNMOVIC “clusters” document issued on 7 March as “a
remarkable document”, detailing “all the unanswered questions about Iraq’s weapons
of mass destruction”, listing “29 different areas in which the inspectors have been unable
to obtain information”.
903.  Describing the activity in the Security Council since 7 March, Mr Blair argued
that, “had we meant what we said in resolution 1441”, the Security Council should
have convened when UNMOVIC published the “clusters” document on 7 March, and
“condemned Iraq as in material breach”. Saddam Hussein was “playing the same old
games in the same old way”. There were “minor concessions”, but there had been
“no fundamental change of heart or mind”.

561

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

904.  Referring to the draft resolution tabled by the UK, US and France on 7 March,
Mr Blair added:
“… we could have asked for the second resolution then and there, because it was
justified. Instead, we laid down an ultimatum calling on Saddam to come into line
with resolution 1441, or be in material breach.”
905.  That was “not an unreasonable proposition, but still countries hesitated”, asking
how full co-operation would be judged. The UK had “worked on a further compromise”,
consulting the inspectors to draw up “five tests, based on” the “clusters” document.
The inspectors had “added another test: that Saddam should publicly call on the Iraqis
to co-operate with them”. Saddam would have been given a specified time to fulfil all six
tests to show full co-operation. If he did so, “the inspectors could then set out a forward
work programme that would extend over a period of time to make sure that disarmament
happened”. If, however, Saddam had failed to meet the tests, “action would follow”.
906.  Mr Blair told the House of Commons that:
“Last Monday [10 March], we were getting very close … We very nearly had the
majority agreement …
“… there were debates about the length of the ultimatum, but the basic construct
was gathering support. Then … France said it would veto a second resolution
whatever the circumstances. Then France denounced the six tests. Later that day,
Iraq rejected them. Still we continued to negotiate …
“Last Friday, France said it could not accept any resolution with an ultimatum in
it. On Monday [17 March], we made final efforts to secure agreement. However,
the fact is that France remains utterly opposed to anything which lays down an
ultimatum authorising action in the event of non-compliance by Saddam.”
907.  Mr Blair added:
“Those on the Security Council opposed to us say that they want Saddam to disarm
but they will not countenance any new resolution which authorises force in the
event of non-compliance. That is their position – no to any ultimatum and no to any
resolution that stipulates that failure to comply will lead to military action. So we must
demand that Saddam disarms, but relinquish any concept of a threat if he does not.”
908.  Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein had allowed the inspectors into Iraq after four
years of refusal because of:
“… the threat of force … It is the imminence of force. The only persuasive power to
which he responds is 250,000 allied troops on his doorstep. However when that fact
is so obvious, we are told that any resolution that authorises force in the event of
non-compliance will be vetoed – not just opposed, but vetoed and blocked.”

562

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

909.  Mr Blair added:
“The tragedy is that had such a resolution ensued and had the UN come together
and united – and if other troops had gone there, not just British and American
troops – Saddam Hussein might have complied. But the moment we proposed the
benchmarks and canvassed support for an ultimatum, there was immediate recourse
to the language of the veto. The choice was not action now or a postponement of
action; the choice was action or no action at all.”
910.  Asked what he meant by an unreasonable veto, Mr Blair responded:
“In resolution 1441, we said that it was Saddam’s final opportunity and that he had
to comply. That was agreed by all members of the Security Council. What is surely
unreasonable is for a country to come forward now, at the very point when we might
reach agreement and when we are – not unreasonably – saying that he must comply
with the UN, after all these months … on the basis of six tests or action will follow.
For that country to say that it will veto such a resolution in all circumstances is what
I would call unreasonable.”
911.  Mr Blair stated:
“The tragedy is that the world has to learn the lesson all over again that weakness
in the face of a threat from a tyrant is the surest way not to peace but … to conflict
… we have been victims of our own desire to placate the implacable, to persuade
towards reason the utterly unreasonable, and to hope that there was some genuine
intent to do good in a regime whose mind is in fact evil.”
912.  In response to a suggestion that the diplomatic process should be continued for
a little longer, Mr Blair responded:
“We could have had more time if the compromise proposal that we put forward had
been accepted … unless the threat of action was made, it was unlikely that Saddam
would meet the tests.
“… the problem with diplomacy was that it came to an end after the position of
France was made public – and repeated in a private conversation – and it said it
would block, by veto, any resolution that contained an ultimatum … the French were
not prepared to change their position. I am not prepared to carry on waiting and
delaying, with our troops in place in difficult circumstances, when that country has
made it clear it has a fixed position and will not change.”
913.  Questioned whether it was he, not the French, Russians and Chinese, who had
changed position and about his statement – that the only circumstances in which he
would go to war without a second resolution was if the inspectors concluded that there
had been no more progress, which they had not; if there were a majority on the Security

563

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Council, which there was not; and if there was an unreasonable veto from one country,
when three Permanent Members were opposed to his policy – Mr Blair replied:
“… resolution 1441 … stated in terms … that if Iraq continued in material breach,
defined as not co-operating fully, immediately and unconditionally, serious
consequences would follow. All we are asking for in the second resolution is the
clear ultimatum that if Saddam continues to fail to co-operate, force would be used.
The French position is that France will vote no, whatever the circumstances. Those
are not my words, but those of the French President. I find it sad that at this point in
time he cannot support us in the position we have set out, which is the only sure way
to disarm Saddam.”
914.  Addressing the conclusion which “any tyrannical regime” might take from the
“world’s diplomatic dance with Saddam Hussein” over the previous 12 years, Mr Blair
stated that such a conclusion would be:
“That our capacity to pass firm resolutions was only matched by our feebleness
in implementing them. That is why this indulgence has to stop – because it is
dangerous: dangerous if such regimes disbelieve us; dangerous if they think they
can use our weakness … and dangerous because one day they will mistake our
innate revulsion against war for permanent incapacity, when in fact, if pushed to the
limit, we will act. But when we act, after years of pretence, the action will have to be
harder, bigger, more total in its impact. It is true that Iraq is not the only country with
weapons of mass destruction, but … to back away from this confrontation now, and
future conflicts will be infinitely worse and more devastating in their effects.
“… any fair observer does not really dispute that Iraq is in breach of resolution 1441
or that it implies action in such circumstances. The real problem is that, underneath,
people dispute that Iraq is a threat, dispute the link between terrorism and weapons
of mass destruction, and dispute, in other words, the whole basis of our assertion
that the two together constitute a fundamental assault on our way of life.”
915.  Arguing that the time had come to act, Mr Blair set out why he believed, in the
context of “an ever more interdependent” world where the threat was “chaos and
disorder”, Iraq posed a threat that was “so serious and why we must tackle it”.
916.  In his view, there were:
“… two begetters of chaos: tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction
and extreme terrorist groups who profess a perverted and false sense of Islam.”
917.  Mr Blair set out his concerns about:

•	
•	

proliferators of nuclear equipment or expertise;
“dictatorships with highly repressive regimes” who were “desperately trying to
acquire” chemical, biological or “particularly, nuclear weapons capability”; some

564

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

•	

of those were “a short time away from having a serviceable nuclear weapon”,
and that activity was increasing, not diminishing; and
the possibility of terrorist groups obtaining and using weapons of mass
destruction, including a “radiological bomb”.

918.  Mr Blair stated that tyrannical regimes with weapons of mass destruction and
terrorist groups had very different motives and different origins and he accepted “fully”
that the association between the two was:
“… loose – but it is hardening. The possibility of the two coming together – of
terrorist groups in possession of weapons of mass destruction or even of a so-called
dirty radiological bomb – is now in my judgement, a real and present danger to
Britain and its national security.”
919.  Addressing the effects of chemical and biological agents, Mr Blair stated that Iraq
was “not the only part of this threat”. But it was “the test of whether we treat the threat
seriously”. Mr Blair added that, faced with the threat:
“… the world should unite. The UN should be the focus both of diplomacy and of
action. That is what [resolution] 1441 said … to break it now, and to will the ends
but not the means, would do more damage in the long term to the UN than any
other single course that we could pursue. To fall back into the lassitude of the last
12 years; to talk, to discuss, to debate but never to act; to declare our will but not
to enforce it; and to continue with strong language but with weak intentions – that
is the worst course imaginable. If we pursue that course, when the threat returns,
from Iraq or elsewhere, who will then believe us? What price our credibility with
the next tyrant?”
920.  Mr Blair stated:
“… there will in any event be no sound future for the United Nations – no guarantee
against the repetition of these events – unless we recognise the urgent need for a
political agenda we can unite upon.
“What we have witnessed here is the consequence of Europe and the United States
dividing from each other … the paralysis of the UN has been born out of the division
that there is.”
921.  Mr Blair stated that there was a risk of the world being divided into rival poles of
power “with the US and its allies in one corner and France, Germany, Russia and their
allies in the other”. That would be “profoundly dangerous”. There was “resentment of
US dominance” and “fear of US unilateralism”.

565

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

922.  Reflecting the strategy he had adopted, Mr Blair stated that the way to deal
with the US was “not rivalry, but partnership”. Europe should have said to the US
in September 2002:
“We understand your strategic anxiety over terrorism and weapons of mass
destruction and we will help you meet it. We will mean what we say in any resolution
we pass and will back it with action if Saddam fails to disarm voluntarily.”
923.  In return, Europe should have asked:
“… that the US should indeed choose the UN path and you [the US] should
recognise the fundamental overriding importance of restarting the Middle East
Peace Process, which we will hold you to.
“That would have been the right and responsible way for Europe and America
to treat each other … and it is a tragedy that it has not happened …”
924.  Mr Blair stated that “what happens after any conflict in Iraq” was of “critical
significance”. There was a chance to unify around the United Nations and a UN
resolution:
“… should provide for the proper governance of Iraq … protect totally the territorial
integrity of Iraq. And that … oil revenues … should be put in a trust fund for the Iraqi
people administered through the UN.”
925.  Mr Blair set out the abuses of Saddam Hussein’s regime and stated that his
removal was the “only true hope” for the Iraqi people.
926.  Concluding his speech, Mr Blair stated:
“If this House now demands that … British troops are pulled back … what then? …
Saddam … will feel strengthened beyond measure … other states … will take it that
the will confronting them is decaying and feeble …
…
“… In this dilemma, no choice is perfect, no choice is ideal, but on this decision
hangs the fate of many things … To retreat now … would put at hazard all that we
hold dearest. To turn the United Nations back into a talking shop; to stifle the first
steps of progress in the Middle East; to leave the Iraqi people to the mercy of events
over which we would have relinquished all power to influence for the better …
“This is not the time to falter. This is the time … to give a lead: to show that we will
stand up for what we know to be right; to show that we will confront the tyrannies
and dictatorships … to show, at the moment of decision that we have the courage
to do the right thing.”

566

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

927.  In his speech, Mr Duncan Smith stated that the official Opposition would support
the Government because it was acting “in the national interest”.328 Iraq posed a threat
to the safety and stability of the Middle East and Saddam Hussein had “the means,
the mentality and the motive to pose a direct threat to our national security”.
928.  Other points made by Mr Duncan Smith included:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

Saddam Hussein was “in complete breach of all his obligations to the United
Kingdom and to the international community”.
He had “absolutely no intention whatsoever of relinquishing the weapons” he
had developed.
The threat from Iraq’s “arsenal to British citizens at home and abroad” could
not “simply be contained. Whether in the hands of his regime or in the hands
of the terrorists to whom he would give his weapons, they pose a clear danger
to British citizens.”
Saddam Hussein’s “last hope” was “to string along the international community
for as long as possible”, and to delay action until the autumn, and, “in the
meantime”, his “prevarication and games” would “split the international
community and wreck the UN”.
There were “pressing questions” about the arrangements for dealing with the
humanitarian consequences of military action.
If “decisive action” had been taken earlier, “we would not now stand on the
verge of war”.

929.  Mr Duncan Smith concluded that, if the House of Commons voted to give
Saddam Hussein:
“… yet another chance, the moment will pass, our concentration will falter,
our energy and focus will disperse and our nerve will fail, with disastrous
consequences …
“… We should stand firm, act and show that we have learned from past failures …”
930.  The Speaker selected a cross-party amendment to the Government motion, moved
by Mr Peter Kilfoyle (Labour), which stated that the House:
“… believes that the case for war against Iraq has not yet been established,
especially given the absence of specific United Nations authorisation; but, in the
event that hostilities do commence, pledges its total support for the British forces
engaged in the Middle East …”329
931.  In his speech supporting the amendment, Mr Kilfoyle argued that military action
would be “illegal, immoral and illogical”. Saddam Hussein had been contained; there was

no evidence provided of links with Al Qaida; he did not have the wherewithal to attack
the UK directly; and there had been “an awful lot of scaremongering”. The Government’s
“impatience” would “reap a whirlwind”.330
932.  In his speech, Mr Kennedy stated that he did “not believe that the case for war”
had been established, but he acknowledged that the Government deserved credit for
persuading a “reluctant” US “to go down the UN route” and for emphasising the primary
need for a “meaningful” MEPP.331 He also drew attention to Mr Annan’s remarks the
previous day, expressing concern about the legitimacy of action without the support
of the Security Council.
933.  Mr Kennedy concluded by drawing attention to the number of people who had
expressed concern about the “doctrine of regime change”, were “wary of the motives”
of the US Administration, and “did not like to see Britain separated from its natural
international allies”.
934.  More than fifty backbench MPs spoke in the debate, offering a wide range of
views about the prospect of military action.
935.  In his speech closing the debate, Mr Straw drew attention to the importance of
a just and lasting settlement of the dispute between Israel and Palestine, which was,
“as important for the future stability of the region as the disarmament of Iraq’s weapons
of mass destruction”.332
936.  In relation to Iraq, Mr Straw drew attention to the recommendations of the Select
Committee on International Development, including the need for a new UN Security
Council resolution “to provide proper authority for reconstruction and redevelopment
work, and, in addition, a proper mandate for any Government who are to operate within
the territory of Iraq once Saddam Hussein is removed”.
937.  Mr Straw stated that the House of Commons had never before had the
opportunity to vote on a substantive motion for its explicit support for the use of the
Armed Forces. That placed “a heavy responsibility” on each member of the House.
938.  Mr Straw added that the choice was “not easy”. He had “worked for months
for a peaceful resolution of the crisis”, and he was as certain as he could be “that the
Government’s course of action was right”.
939.  Mr Straw also stated:

•	

“… no one, either today or in New York in the four Security Council meetings
that I attended, has … claim[ed] that Saddam Hussein has fulfilled the full and
immediate compliance that was required of him.”

There was “no other alternative” to seeking the exile of Saddam Hussein and,
if that failed, “his disarmament by force”.
Containment “failed when the inspectors had to leave in 1998”. Three
Permanent Members of the Security Council had failed to support resolution
1284 (1999) which had been an attempt to offer Iraq “a new way to peaceful
disarmament while containing the threat”. Iraq had said no. The inspectors were
not allowed to return; sanctions were eroded, “and containment was left weaker
than ever”.
The strategy encapsulated in resolution 1441 (2002) was “for the active
disarmament of the regime, backed by a credible threat of force”.
There was “no automaticity about the use of force”; “it was entirely conditional
on Saddam Hussein’s compliance or otherwise with the resolution”.
“We also said – to our five permanent colleagues that if the only issue between
us and them over the ultimatum was more time than the 10 days we had
allowed, of course we could negotiate more time. But no country … has been
prepared to say how much more time should be allowed before time runs out.
None of them is prepared to issue an ultimatum. In reality, they are not asking
for more time. They are asking for time without end.”
Saddam Hussein would not disarm peacefully, so the choice was “either to
leave Saddam where he is, armed and emboldened, an even bigger threat to
his country, his region and international peace and security, or we disarm him
by force”.

940.  Mr Straw concluded:
“… of course there will be consequences if the House approves the Government
motion. Our forces will almost certainly be involved in military action. Some will be
killed; so, too, will innocent Iraqi civilians, but far fewer Iraqis in the future will be
maimed, tortured or killed by the Saddam regime. The Iraqi people will begin to
enjoy the freedom and prosperity that should be theirs. The world will become a
safer place, and, above all, the essential authority of the United Nations will have
been upheld.”
941.  The amendment to the Government motion was defeated by 396 to 217 votes.
942.  The Government motion was approved by 412 to 149 votes.
943.  Mr Blair did not argue that Iraq posed an imminent threat. He stated that the
threat which Saddam Hussein’s arsenal posed to “British citizens at home and
abroad” could not be contained, and that in the hands of the Iraqi regime or in
the hands of the terrorists to whom Saddam Hussein “would give his weapons”,
they posed “a clear danger to British citizens”.
944.  It was the ingrained belief of the UK Government and the intelligence
community that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its
capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was
pursuing an active and successful policy of deception and concealment. That, and
the JIC Assessments of whether and in what circumstances Iraq might use those
capabilities, is addressed in Section 4.
945.  Iraq’s capability was judged to be limited and its chemical and biological
weapons did not pose a direct or imminent threat to the UK. Iraq was judged to
be most likely to use its weapons as a last resort in response to a military attack
which threatened the survival of the regime.
946.  Mr Blair’s statements on the risk of terrorists willing and able to use
weapons of mass destruction being able to obtain them from Iraq are addressed
in Section 7.
947.  Saddam Hussein’s regime had the potential to proliferate material and
know-how to terrorist groups, but it was not judged likely to do so.
948.  Mr Blair’s and Mr Straw’s statements claimed that the UK Government was
acting on behalf of the international community “to uphold the authority of the
Security Council”.
949.  The Charter of the United Nations vests responsibility for the maintenance
of peace and security in the Security Council.
950.  On 18 March, the majority of the Security Council’s members were not
persuaded that the inspections process, and the diplomatic efforts surrounding
it, had reached the end of the road. They did not agree that the time had come
to terminate inspections and resort to force.
951.  In the absence of a majority in the Security Council in support of military
action at that point, the UK was undermining the authority of the Security Council.
DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS, 18 MARCH 2003
952.  Lord Williams of Mostyn set out the Government’s position in the House of Lords,
stating: “Ours is a stark choice: we stand our troops down and turn back or we hold firm
to the course that we have set. We must hold firm.”333
953.  Lord Strathclyde (Conservative) agreed that “to turn about now would be to
court incalculable future danger in the face of the greater emerging threat to our
future security”.334
954.  Baroness Williams (Liberal Democrat), referring to Mr Cook’s resignation statement
on 17 March, commented that there was “more than one set of opinions about how

effective are the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq … As so often in this argument,
we look at a profound ambiguity, which people interpret in different ways.”335
955.  Addressing the failure to secure a second resolution, Baroness Williams added:
“Much of the blame has been passed over to France. France has been seriously
misinterpreted, not least by our own tabloid newspapers … I am told by the French
Embassy … that France indicated it would veto a second resolution even if there
were nine members of the Security Council supporting it, but made absolutely plain
this was a judgement about timelines, not about Iraq failing to comply with Security
Council resolutions. In other words – surely, it is not too complex a thought for us to
understand – France believes that timelines for the inspectors were unacceptably
short … [and] would have supported the resolution if in its view the inspectors
indicated that there was no longer sufficient compliance with their work to enable
them to complete it in a satisfactory manner.
“Without the second resolution the legitimacy of our actions will continue to
be disputed.”
956.  In her concluding remarks, Baroness Symons highlighted “the breadth of
agreement [during the debate] that the Iraqi regime is evil, cruel and has palpably failed
to disarm and meet a series of UN obligations placed on it”.336
957.  Baroness Symons responded to a number of questions raised during the debate,
including on:

•	
•	
•	
•	
•	

335 
336 

The threat from WMD. Iraq had “thousands of chemical and biological bombs”.
The 150 weapons inspectors “simply will not find the weapons of mass
destruction in a country the size of France”.
The exhaustion of possibilities for a negotiated solution. France’s position on the
second resolution meant that negotiation was now “beyond our reach”.
The legality of military action. Divisions of legal opinion in international law were
“nothing new”. The Attorney General had had access to all information and had
delivered a clear view.
The legal position of those engaged in conflict. Military action would take full
account of requirements and obligations of international law.
Whether military action was the right response. The Iraqi people would be
liberated from a life of tyranny and repression and it was necessary for the UN
to face up to its responsibilities. It was the mission of the UK’s Armed Forces
to “enforce the will of the United Nations and the international community”.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Events of 19 and 20 March 2003
958.  Mr de Villepin telephoned Mr Straw on 19 March with a message for Mr Blair from
President Chirac.337 The President had been “shocked and hurt” by Mr Blair’s statements
to Parliament. They had been unnecessary. President Chirac understood the pressures
that the UK Government was under, but such statements were not acceptable from an
ally and an EU partner. Nor were they in accordance with reality.
959.  Mr Straw rebutted the comments. He and Mr Blair had felt their comments were
justified by the circumstances; not to solve domestic problems but to explain the reality
of the situation to which France had contributed. The UK felt that, after resolution 1441,
“France had made a strategic choice not to follow through”.
960.  Mr de Villepin responded that what he had heard from London and Washington
did not “link with the truth”. He concluded that the statements from the UK Government
had shown no courage.
961.  Mr Straw concluded that “he knew a great deal about courage: the Prime Minister
had shown great courage”.
962.  The first Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq (also known as the “War Cabinet”) took place at
8.30am on 19 March.
963.  Mr Straw informed the meeting that he had received “an official complaint” from
Mr de Villepin “about the British representation of the French position in respect of Iraq”.
He also set out the need to explain the UK’s position to other countries and to publicise
the international support for the Coalition.338
964.  The discussion on the importance of a UN resolution covering the post-conflict
phase is addressed in Section 6.5.
965.  Advice on military issues is addressed in Section 8.
966.  Subsequently, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce briefed Mr Blair on the military
preparations.339
967.  A JIC Note issued on 19 March, ‘Saddam: the Beginning of the End’, stated
that intelligence showed the Iraqi regime was making final preparations for war.340
Saddam Hussein had rejected US demands for his exile and the US had:
“… now made clear that even a last-minute change of mind by Saddam would not
stop the Coalition from moving against Iraq’s WMD.”

968.  The Note added that the JIC continued to judge that Saddam Hussein’s scope
for “extreme and unpredictable action is increasing as the prospect of an attack
approaches”. The JIC view on the possible use of CBW is set out in Section 4.3.
969.  Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice at noon.341
970.  Sir David told Dr Rice that the French had “launched a fierce public attack” on
the UK.
971.  Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the meeting of the Security Council and
the need to rebuild relationships. Sir David said that Dr Blix’s work programme provided
“further confirmation of how little Saddam had done to fulfil his disarmament obligations”.
The UK was in favour of a continuing role for UNMOVIC; it would be “important to have
UNMOVIC available to provide independent verification when we found WMD”.
972.  Mr Blair and President Bush spoke at 12.40pm on 19 March.342 They discussed
the military plans and timetable. Mr Blair said that he had “reviewed the military plans
and was confident that they would work”. Post-conflict issues would be the focus of
conversation when they met. A full-day meeting was envisaged to cover the ground.
Mr Blair suggested that the discussions might include bringing in allies who had opposed
military action and co-ordinating a communications strategy.
973.  Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:
“As Bush said … other leaders would look at what he [Blair] did, and the power with
which he did it, and really learn lessons from it. ‘Landslide’ he [Bush] said, referring
to the Road Map publication as ‘genius’. He referred back to what he called ‘the
cojones conference’ at Camp David. ‘You showed cojones, you never blinked.
A leader who leads will win and you are a real leader.’ He said the object is regime
change … TB felt that the next stage after winning the war would be to work out the
geopolitical fallout and repair some of the divisions. Bush said Condi had this line
that we should ‘punish the French, ignore the Germans and forgive the Russians’,
which was pretty glib. TB didn’t comment at the time but later said he didn’t agree.
We should try to build bridges with all of them. We finally got Bush to agree there
was no point TB going to the US at the moment, that we should wait until the
fighting starts …
“… Bush said that the Iraqis would now be ‘shredding documents like crazy’…
the Road Map would be published today when Abu Mazen was confirmed …”343

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

974.  President Bush wrote in his memoir that he convened “the entire National Security
Council” on the morning of 19 March where he “gave the order to launch Operation
Iraqi Freedom”.344
SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE, 19 MARCH 2003
975.  Although there had been unanimous support for a rigorous inspections and
monitoring regime backed by the threat of military force as the means to disarm
Iraq when resolution 1441 was adopted, there was no such consensus in the
Security Council in March 2003.
976.  In the Security Council debate on 19 March, the majority of members of
the Security Council, including China, France and Russia, made clear that they
thought the goal of disarming Iraq could be achieved by peaceful means and
emphasised the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance
of international peace and security.
977.  The Security Council held an open debate on Iraq on 19 March. The Foreign
Ministers of France, Germany, Guinea, Russia and Syria attended.345
978.  Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC’s draft work programme had been presented to the
Security Council on 17 March in response to the wishes of its members, but, “on the
very same day”, UNMOVIC had been “constrained together with other United Nations
units to order the withdrawal of all our inspectors and other international staff from Iraq”.
979.  Dr Blix stated that he felt:
“… sadness that three and a half months of work … have not brought the
assurances needed about the absence of weapons of mass destruction or other
proscribed items in Iraq, that no more time is available for inspections and that
armed action now seems imminent.”
He was relieved that there had been full Iraqi co-operation on the withdrawal of UN staff.
980.  Dr Blix stated that the inspectors had “worked broadly” but it was “evidently
possible for the Council to single out a few issues for resolution within a specific
time”. The draft programme selected “12 key tasks” where progress “could have
an impact on the Council’s assessment of co-operation of Iraq under resolution 1284
(1999)”. But, whatever approach was followed, the results would depend on Iraq’s
active co-operation. Since his last report to the Security Council [on 7 March], Iraq
had sent several more letters on unresolved issues. Those efforts by Iraq “should be
acknowledged”, but UNMOVIC’s experts had “found, so far, that, in substance, only
limited new information has been provided that will help to resolve remaining questions”.

981.  Dr Blix said that the draft work programme “would seem to have only limited
practical relevance in the current situation”. It was “evidently for the Council to consider
the next steps”. He hoped the Council would “be aware” that it had “in UNMOVIC
staff a unique body of international experts”; that “no other international organisation
has trained inspectors in the field of biological weapons and missiles”; and that,
“With increasing attention being devoted to proliferation of these weapons [of mass
destruction], this capability may be valuable to the Council”.
982.  Mr Gustavo Zlauvinen, International Atomic Energy Agency representative
to the UN, said that the Agency had transmitted its work programme, which was
“self‑explanatory”, to the Council that morning. Dr ElBaradei would be “available any
time in the future to discuss … the work programme should the Council decide to do so”.
983.  Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister, stated that
the world was “facing an imminent war in Iraq”. The Security Council could not “remain
silent” and its task “must be to safeguard its function and preserve its relevance”.
Developments had “brought the work of the United Nations on the ground to a standstill”
and were “cause for the deepest concern”. The draft work programme “with its
realistic description of unresolved disarmament issues” provided “clear and convincing
guidelines on how to disarm Iraq peacefully within a short space of time”. He wanted “to
stress” that it was “possible to disarm Iraq peacefully by upholding those demands with
tight deadlines”. Peaceful means had “not been exhausted” and Germany “emphatically
rejects the impending war”.
984.  Mr Fischer deeply regretted that “considerable efforts to disarm Iraq using peaceful
means” seemed to have little chance of success. France, Germany and Russia had
“put forward proposals for a more efficient inspections regime consisting of clear
disarmament steps with deadlines, most recently on 15 March”, and other members
of the Council had also “submitted constructive proposals until the final hours of
the negotiations”.
985.  Mr Fischer stated:
“During the last few days, we have moved significantly closer to our common
objective: that of effectively countering the risk posed by Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction with complete and comprehensive arms control. Especially in recent
weeks, substantial progress was made in disarmament. The scrapping of the
Al Samoud missiles made headway … And the regime in Baghdad is beginning,
under pressure, to clear up the unanswered questions on VX and anthrax.”
986.  Mr Fischer continued:
“Iraq’s readiness to co-operate was unsatisfactory. It was hesitant and slow. The
Council agrees on that. But can this seriously be regarded as grounds for war…?

575

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“There is no doubt that, particularly in recent weeks, Baghdad has begun to
co-operate more. The information Iraq has provided … are steps in the right
direction. Baghdad is meeting more and more of the demands contained in the
Security Council resolutions. But why should we … especially now – abandon
our plans to disarm Iraq by peaceful means?
“The majority of Security Council members believe that there are no grounds now
for breaking off the disarmament process …”
987.  Mr Fischer made three points:

•	
•	
•	

The “myth” that the Security Council had “failed” must be countered. It had
“made available the instruments to disarm Iraq peacefully”. The Security Council
was “not responsible” for what happened outside the United Nations.
“… clearly, under the current circumstances the policy of military intervention has
no credibility. It does not have the support of our people. It would not have taken
much to safeguard the unity of the Security Council. There is no basis in the
United Nations Charter for regime change by military means.”
The inspection regime should be preserved and the work programme endorsed
because both would be needed after military action.

988.  Mr Fischer concluded that Germany was “convinced that the United Nations
and the Security Council must continue to play the central role in the Iraq conflict”.
That was “crucial to world order and must continue to be the case in the future”.
The United Nations was “the key institution for the preservation of peace and stability
and for the peaceful reconciliation of interests”. There was “no substitute for its functions
as a guardian of peace”.
989.  Mr Fischer also argued that an “effective international non-proliferation and
disarmament regime” continued to be needed. The instruments developed in the Iraq
process could be used to make the world a safer place. But the UN was the “only
appropriate framework” for that: “No one can seriously believe that disarmament wars
are the way forward.” Europe had experienced the horrors of war “too often”: “It can
only be the very last resort when all peaceful alternatives really have been exhausted.”
Germany had:
“… accepted the necessity of war on two occasions … because all peaceful
alternatives had proved unsuccessful.
“Germany fought side by side with its allies in Kosovo. It did likewise in Afghanistan.
“Today, however, we in Germany do not believe that there is no alternative to military
force. To the contrary, we feel that Iraq can be disarmed using peaceful means.”
990.  Mr de Villepin said that for France “war can only be a last resort”. He stated that
the inspectors’ work programmes reminded the Council that there was “still a clear and

576

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

credible prospect for disarming Iraq peacefully” with a “realistic timetable”. Inspections
were “producing tangible results”.
991.  Mr de Villepin stated that a choice was being made “between two visions of the
world”; between “those who choose to use force and think that they can resolve the
world’s complexity through swift preventive action”; and those who choose “resolute
action and a long-term approach”. He warned:
“… in today’s world, to ensure our security, we must take into account the manifold
crises and many dimensions, including the cultural and religious ones. Nothing
enduring in international relations can be built without dialogue and respect for the
other, without strictly abiding by principles, especially for democracies that must set
the example. To ignore that is to run the risk of misunderstanding, radicalisation and
spiralling violence. That is especially true in the Middle East, an area of fractures
and ancient conflicts, where stability must be a major objective for us.”
992.  Mr de Villepin added:
“To those who think that the scourge of terrorism will be eradicated through what
is done in Iraq, we say that they run the risk of failing … An outbreak of force in
such an unstable area can only exacerbate the tensions and fractures on which
terrorists feed.”
993.  Subsequently, Mr de Villepin stated:
“… terrorism is fuelled by organised crime networks; it cleaves to the contours of
lawless areas; it thrives on regional crises; it garners support from the divisions
in the world; and it uses all available resources, from the most rudimentary …
to whatever weapons of mass destruction it can manage to acquire.”
994.  Mr de Villepin called for the international community to “intensify” the fight against
terrorism; for a “new impetus” in the fight against proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction; and to “recover the initiative in regional conflicts” and in particular the
Israeli‑Palestinian conflict.
995.  In Iraq, the international community should “remain mobilised” to “dress the
wounds of war” and to “build peace”. No State could “claim the necessary legitimacy”
for the latter; the “legal and moral authority” could “stem only from the United Nations”,
which should also “establish a framework for the country’s economic reconstruction”.
Action should be guided by “respect for the unity and territorial integrity of Iraq, and the
preservation of its sovereignty”.
996.  Mr de Villepin concluded:
“In a world where the threats are asymmetrical, where the weak defy the strong, the
power of conviction, the capacity to persuade and the ability to change hearts counts
as much as the number of military divisions …

577

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

“Given this new world, it is imperative that the international community’s action be
guided by principles.
“The first is respect for law. The keystone of international order, it must apply under
all circumstances, but even more so when it is a question of taking the gravest
decision: to use force. Only on that condition can force be legitimate, and only on
that condition can it restore order and peace.
“Next is the defence of freedom and justice. We must not compromise on what is
at the core of our values. We shall be listened to and heeded only if we are inspired
by the very ideals of the United Nations.
“Last is the spirit of dialogue and tolerance …
“… Never has the United Nations been so necessary. It is up to this body to muster
the resolve to meet these challenges, because the United Nations is the place
where international law and legitimacy are founded and because it speaks on behalf
of peoples.
“To the clash of arms … the international community … must respond …”
997.  Mr Ivanov stated that, by unanimously adopting resolution 1441 (2002), the
Security Council had taken upon itself “the serious responsibility of completing the
process of Iraq’s disarmament”. The reports from UNMOVIC and the IAEA showed
“convincingly that the international inspectors have succeeded in achieving tangible
results”. As a result of the unity of the international community and the joint pressure on
the Iraqi authorities, “including a military presence in the region”, Baghdad had “fulfilled
virtually every condition set by the inspectors” and had “not put up any kind of serious
obstacle to their activities”. If the international inspectors were “given the opportunity
to continue their work”, they had “everything they need to complete the process of
Baghdad’s peaceful disarmament”.
998.  Mr Ivanov questioned the “the right to use force against Iraq outside the Charter
of the United Nations” and the authority for “the violent overthrow of the leadership of
a sovereign State”.
999.  Mr Ivanov concluded that President Putin had extended “solidarity and support”
to President Bush after the attacks on 11 September 2001, and:
“If today we really had indisputable facts demonstrating that there was a direct threat
from the territory of Iraq to the security of the United States of America, then Russia,
without any hesitation, would be prepared to use the entire arsenal of measures
provided under the United Nations Charter to eliminate such a threat. However, the
Security Council today is not in possession of such facts. That is why we prefer a
political settlement, relying on the activities of UNMOVIC and the IAEA, which enjoy
the full trust of the international community.”

578

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

1000.  Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, the Syrian Foreign Minister, reminded the Council of the
“most important commitment” in the United Nations Charter “to practice tolerance and
live together in peace with one another as good neighbours, and to unite our strength to
maintain international peace and security”. He questioned whether the US “and its ally,
the United Kingdom” could absolve themselves of the responsibility for the difficulties
of finding constructive solutions for the problems in Iraq and Palestine. He suggested
that a “war of aggression” was about to be unleashed which was “unfair and unjustified”
and would “come back to haunt those who have advocated and promoted it, instead of
enhancing their status in history”.
1001.  Drawing attention to Israel’s rejection of international inspection and supervision,
Mr al-Shara’ stated that Syria had supported resolution 1441 because of its:
“… belief in supporting the international will to find a peaceful solution to the Iraqi
crisis and to eliminate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction through peaceful means.”
1002.  Mr al-Shara’ said that “the majority of the members of the Council rejected the
idea of adopting a draft resolution authorising the use of force”. He expressed “extreme
regret and concern at attempts by some to call into question the role of the Security
Council in particular, and the United Nations in general, simply because they did not
succeed in imposing their will and positions on the Council and the United Nations”.
He was highly critical of those who had “reneged” on resolution 1441, alleging that
the objective was not to disarm Iraq “but to occupy it and usurp its natural resources”.
He questioned whether Iraq represented a threat to the US, pointing out that Al Qaida
had active or sleeper cells in more than 150 countries.
1003.  Mr al-Shara’ concluded that the “letter and the spirit” of the ultimatum issued
by the US led Syria to conclude that the objective was “the removal or the bringing to
justice of an individual or a group of individuals”. Syria urged “those concerned to shut
down the machinery of war” and to spare the lives of:
“… millions of innocent Iraqis as well as the lives of their new oppressors who are
marching thousands of miles … holding up the banner of liberation like a myth.
Many people – including many Americans – have stood against the foreign occupier
in defence of liberty and independence. That is the logic of history … that will
continue …”
1004.  Mr Akram stated that Pakistan had “consistently advocated a peaceful solution”.
He stressed “that every possible avenue should be exhausted to secure a peaceful
solution, and that the use of force must be the very last resort”. Pakistan believed that
the programme of work identified by Dr Blix “could have provided a useful basis for the
completion of the disarmament process … if Iraq’s full and unconditional co-operation

579

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

could have been assured and obtained in time”. Members of the Security Council had
been separated by “honest differences”. Once military action began, the duties:
“… of the Security Council to restore peace and security, to contain conflict, to
prevent the suffering of the Iraqi people and others in the region, to ensure the
territorial integrity of Iraq and its neighbours and to ensure the stability of this
sensitive region … will not end; they will become more acute.”
1005.  Mr Zinser deplored “the path of war”, referring to the UN Charter and the
“principles” which Mexico had learned from history for the “peaceful settlement of
disputes and disarmament”. He described the inspections regime for Iraq as “the
most robust, dynamic and effective effort at peaceful disarmament that has ever been
attempted” and stated that Mexico was “convinced that … the United Nations could
have brought about the peaceful disarmament of Iraq”.
1006.  Ambassador Negroponte stated that the consideration of the draft programmes
was “incompatible with Iraq’s non-compliance with resolution 1441 (2002) and the
current reality on the ground”; the work programme was “predicated on the assumption
that Iraq will provide immediate, unconditional and active co-operation”. That had:
“… been manifestly lacking. No realistic programme of work or outline of key
unresolved issues can be developed … while Iraq fails to co-operate fully, actively
and unconditionally, nor can it be developed absent sound information on Iraqi
programmes since 1998 and all other information that is lacking.”
1007.  Ambassador Negroponte added that the draft work programmes and:
“… the paper on key remaining disarmament tasks make clear the multitude
of important issues that Iraq has avoided addressing. These are the kinds
of documents that we would have been able to discuss if Iraq had met the
requirements of resolution 1441 (2002), but they cannot now lead us to the results
that this Council demanded: the immediate peaceful disarmament of Iraq.
“Under current circumstances we have no choice but to set this work aside for the
time being … we do not exclude the possibility that it may prove useful to return to
these documents at some point in the future.”
1008.  Ambassador Negroponte stated that the US had committed “significant resources
… across all relevant United States Government agencies and in support of United
Nations efforts to anticipate likely requirements and to be prepared to administer
necessary relief as quickly as possible”.
1009.  Mr Belinga Eboutou stated that “the peaceful disarmament of Iraq by means of
inspections” had ended. The UNMOVIC draft work programme “would have been a good
basis for work” but “much remained to be done” and his delegation did “not see how
the inspectors would have achieved their heavy task in the absence of full, active and
unconditional co-operation”.

580

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

1010.  Mr Arias said Saddam Hussein was responsible for the suspension of inspections:
“Through his ongoing policy of deceit, concealment and delaying tactics, he has
decided to openly opt for the path of confrontation, contravening the interests of
his people and the demands of the Security Council.”
The draft resolution tabled by the US, UK and Spain was “designed to ratchet up the
pressure on the Iraqi regime” and had “in fact, offered Saddam Hussein another
opportunity”.
1011.  Mr Arias stated that resolution1441 recognised that Iraq’s non-compliance with
the Council’s resolutions constituted a threat to international peace and security; that the
Council had met “many times to examine successive reports of the inspectors”. Iraq had
“still not complied with the will of the international community as had been demanded …
Therefore, peace and security continue unassured.”
1012.  Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN, stated
that Chile had been convinced that “the inspections programme – strengthened, zealous
and investigative, carried to its logical conclusion and accompanied by growing and
persistent military pressure – was capable of achieving … the peaceful disarmament
of Iraq.” The Council:
“… needed to make clear to the regime of Saddam Hussein that the United Nations
would move towards the disarmament of Iraq at any cost. The Council should have
cultivated its internal unity …
“That was not possible. We fear that the consequences will be serious for humanity.
The Iraqi regime never understood the dimension of its lethargy and did not
appreciate the gravity of the punishment to which it was exposing its own people …
the Council was unable to find … the flexibility needed to set deadlines and to define
a path of collective action that would have enabled it to shoulder the responsibilities
entrusted to it by the Charter of the United Nations. Today, every one of us must
assume his part of the responsibility.”
1013.  Mr Valdés continued that it was “not the time for recriminations”; and that nothing
could be more serious than suspending the inspections process which “could create
doubts concerning the validity of this instrument”. He concluded:
“The Security Council … must now work tirelessly, inspired by the objective of
preserving life and restoring peace. Perhaps if we do everything that we can and
save as many lives as we can, the millions of people in the world who have now
lost faith in our capacity to make the world a civilised place may again lend their
inspiration to our tasks.”
1014.  Mr Helder Lucas, Angolan Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN,
deplored the “fact that the inspectors were unable to complete their task of disarming
Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction. Angola also deplored the “fact that Iraq was

581

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

unable to seize the last opportunity afforded to it by the Security Council”. Angola [had]
made repeated pleas to Iraq to co-operate fully and honestly with the United Nations
in complying with the Council resolutions relating to its unconditional disarmament –
particularly resolution 1441 (2002) – and to convince the international community as
a whole that it was making genuine and determined efforts to disarm. The use of force
should be a last resort; and that the decision “should be within the United Nations
framework in order to count on the international community’s full support”; that Angola
had “advocated the principle of safeguarding the Security Council’s primacy as the most
appropriate mechanism for regulating crisis situations and for imposing international
law through compliance with its resolutions”; and that it had “defended the necessity”
of Council unity.
1015.  Mr Wang stated that the work programme, “if implemented” would “surely make
the inspections more organised, and more targeted” and would “help enhance” their
effectiveness. He added that:
“In the light of recent progress made in the inspections, we believe that it is possible
to achieve the goal of disarming Iraq through peaceful means. We should not put
an end to the road to peaceful disarmament.”
He expressed China’s “utmost regret and disappointment” about a situation where war
might break out at any minute. China would do all it could to avert war.
1016.  Mr Wang concluded:
“The Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international
peace and security. No matter what the circumstances may be, the Council must
shoulder its responsibility …”
1017.  Mr Tafrov stated that inspections were “truly effective only with … full and active
co-operation on the part of the country and Government concerned”. He stated that
Bulgaria sincerely regretted that efforts to disarm Iraq peacefully had “not yielded
the desired results”; and confirmed that “since all the political possibilities” had “been
exhausted”, Bulgaria’s position was that Iraq had “failed to seize its last chance”.
1018.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock underlined:
“… the United Kingdom’s deep regret that it has not been possible for the Council
to find an agreed way forward on Iraq. The United Kingdom tried as hard as any
member of the Security Council to achieve that.
“… we should not forget what brought us to this point: the fundamental failure of
Iraq to disarm in the face of 12 years of demands, pressure and pleas from the
Security Council and … virtually the whole international community. If Iraq had made
a genuine effort … to close outstanding issues of substance at any time in the past
decade, particularly after resolution 1441 (2002) afforded it the final opportunity to
do so, and if Iraq had respected the United Nations, we would not be where we are.

582

3.8  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 8 to 20 March 2003

“I repeat what British Ministers have made clear: any action which the United
Kingdom has to take in this matter will be in accordance with international law and
based on relevant resolutions of the Security Council.”
1019.  Sir Jeremy stated that the UN had a central role to play “on Iraq and on the
wider issues associated with it” and he hoped that “with the active contribution of the
Secretary-General”, rapid progress could be made “on this crucial area”. Ms Short was
in New York to discuss humanitarian issues.
1020.  Sir Jeremy concluded that the UK continued “to see an important role” for
UNMOVIC and the IAEA “in verifying the disarmament of Iraq and in carrying out longer
term monitoring”. He commended the inspectors for their “professional work” and noted
the work programmes and key tasks, but: “Equally” he noted that “without a co-operating
Iraqi government … it would never be possible to be confident of the key tasks or of
making progress against them”. The programmes should be kept under review but a
“more definitive” programme would be “possible when there is an administration in Iraq
which is prepared to co-operate fully, actively and unconditionally and when there is
a secure situation on the ground”.
1021.  Mr François Lounceny Fall, President of the Security Council and the Guinean
Foreign Minister, deeply regretted that the Security Council had not been able to
arrive at a common position. Guinea believed “in the possibility of safeguarding peace
and attaining our common objective: the complete disarmament of Iraq”. If armed
conflict was “inevitable”, “appropriate steps … to spare the civilian population and limit
the destruction of the economic and social infrastructure” were “desirable”. He was
determined “to work together with other members to continue dialogue” which was
“the only way to restore unity”. That was “the very basis of the credibility of the Security
Council” and was “more than ever necessary in order to enable it effectively to carry
out its mission of preserving international peace and security”.
1022.  Mr Aldouri expressed his “appreciation” for the efforts made by Council members
to find a peaceful solution to the “current crisis”, which had been “created by the United
States, the United Kingdom and Spain, with the intention of launching a hostile war
against Iraq and occupying it under the pretext of the presence in Iraq of weapons of
mass destruction”. There had been “three or four discordant voices calling for war”.
Many other voices “responding to the international community and human conscience,
as well as to the principles of truth, justice and the Charter of the United Nations” had
called for peace.
1023.  Mr Aldouri continued:
“For the record, and for the sake of historical accuracy, as well as to reassure every
State that has recently made active efforts to maintain peace and to prevent war, we
would like to reiterate that Iraq no longer possesses weapons of mass destruction.
The presence of such weapons has been relegated to the past. Iraq decided in 1991
to destroy the weapons it had produced. That action stemmed from the conviction
583

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

underlying Iraq’s policy to rid itself of such weapons. Proof of this … lies in the failure
by the United States and Britain to prove any allegation that Iraq has possessed
such weapons in recent years, and especially during the period following the
adoption of resolution 1441 (2002).”
1024.  Mr Aldouri stated that the inspectors had “refuted all the misleading information
that was presented” by the US and UK; and that the inspectors had “proved that
information to be false”, including the information that Secretary Powell had “worked
so arduously to put before the Council as damning evidence”. The US and the UK had
failed to “provide even a shred of evidence”.
1025.  Mr Aldouri added that, when the US and the UK:
“… realised that the world was beginning to understand the truth, namely, that Iraq
was free of weapons of mass destruction, those countries decided to expose their
real goals and intentions … to occupy Iraq and to control its oil wells … The coming
days will prove the reality of that truth. But by then it will be too late.”
1026.  Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq welcomed the work programme presented by Dr Blix
and would “do its utmost to complete those tasks as soon as possible and to answer
every question raised in the report”. Iraq had finalised two “important” reports, on anthrax
and unmanned planes, which would be handed over to UNMOVIC. He warned that
the already “dire humanitarian situation”, which was “due to an unjust embargo”, would
deteriorate further:
“Electricity, potable water, sewage treatment, communications and other essential
needs … will be affected or, as was the case in 1991, destroyed. That will lead to
a real humanitarian catastrophe …
“The direct humanitarian effects of the military attack will mean tens of thousands
of casualties and the complete destruction of the country’s infrastructure.”
1027.  Mr Aldouri dismissed the offers of millions of dollars of aid from the US and
the UK and the commitment to rebuild the infrastructure that would be destroyed.
He regretted the withdrawal of all UN agencies, the suspension of the Oil-for-Food
programme and the withdrawal of its entire international staff “in record time”. That was
“truly astonishing”; and the “decision to withdraw the inspectors so swiftly” paved the
way for the US and UK to “carry out acts of military aggression … much faster than
was expected”.
1028.  Mr Aldouri concluded by reaffirming that Iraq would “continue to work with the
Security Council to make the truth known” that Iraq was “free of weapons of mass
destruction”. Iraq hoped that the Council would “continue to search for a peaceful
solution to the crisis, ensure that the work of the inspectors continues and resume
the Oil-for-Food programme”.

584

1029.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported:
“Even at the precipice of war, Aldouri maintains Iraq has no WMD.”346
1030.  Mr Annan stated that he shared “the regrets expressed by many members of the
Council” that it had “not been possible to reach a common position”.347 It was “a sad day
for the United Nations and the international community”. He knew that “millions of people
around the world” shared that “sense of disappointment” and were “deeply alarmed by
the prospect of imminent war”.
1031.  Mr Annan added that it was the “plight of the Iraqi people” that was now his “most
immediate concern”. In the short term, a conflict could “make things worse – perhaps
much worse”. The members of the Council should agree to “do everything we can to
mitigate this imminent disaster”.
1032.  Mr Annan explicitly pointed out that:
“Under international law, the responsibility for protecting civilians in conflict falls on
the ‘belligerents’. In any area under military occupation, responsibility for the welfare
of the population falls on the Occupying Power.”
1033.  Mr Annan added that: “Without in any way assuming or diminishing that ultimate
responsibility”, the UN would do “whatever we can to help”. There would be an appeal
for more funds to finance relief operations and decisions by the Council would be
needed to adjust the Oil-for-Food programme.
1034.  Mr Annan concluded by expressing:
“… the hope that the effort to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people and to
rehabilitate their society after so much destruction may yet be the task around which
the unity of the Council can be rebuilt.”
1035.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that France, Russia, Germany and Syria
had been “most forthright in underlining that peaceful disarmament would have been
possible”; and that most delegations had underlined “the importance of re-establishing
Council unity”. He concluded:
“The day went as well as could have been expected with no real recrimination.
While there was a lot of regret and gloom about the political state we had reached,
there was just as much focus on the way forward and humanitarian efforts. Many will
have wondered why Ministers were there at all.”348

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1036.  In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote:
“The decision by the United States and its allies to proceed with the invasion of Iraq
without Security Council authorisation was a defeat for all of us who had sought to
ensure that Iraq’s defiance of the United Nations was met by a unified and effective
response. But it was a vindication, too, of principle over power. Members of the
Council, including close allies and neighbours of the United States, had insisted on
the prerogative of the United Nations Security Council to decide under international
law whether a member state was in material breach of the Council’s resolutions, and
what the consequences should be.”349
MILITARY OPERATIONS BEGIN
1037.  Shortly before midnight on 19 March, the US informed Sir David Manning that
there was to be a change to the plan and US air strikes would be launched at 0300 GMT
on 20 March.350
1038.  Early on the morning of 20 March, US forces crossed into Iraq and seized the
port area of Umm Qasr.351
1039.  Mr Straw told the Cabinet on 20 March that inspections had not produced the
disarmament of Iraq and that Dr Blix had told the Security Council on 19 March that Iraq
had “failed to produce assurance of its disarmament”.352
1040.  Mr Blair concluded that the Government:
“… should lose no opportunity to propagate the reason, at every level and as
widely as possible, why we had arrived at a diplomatic impasse, and why it was
necessary to take action against Iraq. France had not been prepared to accept
that Iraq’s failure to comply with its obligations should lead to the use of force to
achieve compliance.”353
1041.  The invasion of Iraq is addressed in Section 8. The continuing discussions about
the planning and preparations for a post-conflict Iraq and the UK’s role in that are
addressed in Section 6.5.

Mr Blair’s “Address to the Nation”, 20 March 2003
In an “Address to the Nation” on 20 March, announcing that UK forces were taking part
in military action, Mr Blair stated that the world faced a:
“… new threat: of disorder and chaos born either of brutal states like Iraq, armed with
weapons of mass destruction; or of extreme terrorist groups. Both hate our way of
life, our freedom, our democracy.
“My fear, deeply held, based in part on the intelligence that I see is that these threats
come together and deliver catastrophe to our country and world.
“Some say if we act, we become a target. The truth is all nations are targets …
“Should terrorists obtain these weapons now being manufactured and traded round
the world, the damage they could inflict to our economies, our security, to world
peace, would be beyond our most vivid imagination.
“My judgement, as Prime Minister, is that this threat is real, growing and of an entirely
different nature to any conventional threat to our security that Britain has faced
before.
“For 12 years, the world has tried to disarm Saddam … UN weapons inspectors say
vast amounts of chemical and biological poisons, such as anthrax, VX nerve agent,
and mustard gas remain unaccounted for in Iraq.
“So our choice is clear: back down and leave Saddam hugely strengthened; or
proceed to disarm him by force. Retreat might give us a moment of respite but years
of repentance at our weakness would I believe follow.
“It is true that Saddam is not the only threat. But it is true also … that the best way
to deal with future threats peacefully, is to deal with present threats with resolve.
“Removing Saddam will be a blessing to the Iraqi people …
“Our commitment to the post-Saddam humanitarian effort will be total. We shall help
Iraq move towards democracy …
…
“But these challenges and others that confront us … require a world of order and
stability. Dictators like Saddam, terrorist groups like Al Qaida threaten the very
existence of such a world.
“That is why I have asked our troops to go into action tonight …”354

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

1042.  On 20 March, Ambassador William S. Farish, the US Ambassador to the UK, sent
a letter congratulating Mr Blair on his success in the House of Commons debate and
vote on 18 March.355
1043.  Thanking Ambassador Farish, Mr Blair responded that he believed:
“… the action the American and British Armed Forces are taking in Iraq will make
our two countries safer and Iraq a better place for its people. I think this view is
increasingly supported by British and international opinion. It is the right thing to do.
I am pleased to be working so closely with President Bush on this …”356

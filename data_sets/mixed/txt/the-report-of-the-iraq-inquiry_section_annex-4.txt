Map 2. Ethnic distribution

NOTES:
• There is little reliable demographic data for Iraq.
In addition, the most recent census in 1997 was
based on ethnicity only and did not record
confessional differences.
• Arab Shia estimated to be 60% of population.
• Many, especially in cosmopolitan areas such as
Baghdad and Basra are intermarried with
Sunni Arab.
• Unknown number of Kurdish Shia.
• Sunnis present in all Southern Provinces,
mainly in urban areas.

The Report of the Iraq Inquiry

Map 3. Iraq: Multi-National Division boundaries, June 2003
to May 2004

After the declared end of major combat operations, Iraq was divided into six divisional areas:
Multi-National Division (North) (MND(N)), Multi-National Division (North-Central) (MND(NC)), Multi-National Division (Baghdad) (MND(B)),
Multi-National Force (West) (MNF(W)), Multi-National Division (Center-South) (MND(CS)) and Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)).
In late 2004 MND(N) was divided into MND(NE) and MNF(NW).
In late 2005 MNF(NW) and MND(NC) were merged to create a new MND(N).
In early 2007 a new Multi-National Division (Center) was established relieving MND(B) of responsibility for security south of Baghdad.
In late 2008 MND(NE) was dissolved and became part of MND(N).
In early 2009 MND(CS) was dissolved and became part of MND(C).
The boundary of MND(SE) remained unchanged from 2003 to 2009 until the withdrawal of UK troops.
